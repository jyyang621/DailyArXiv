However, existing RAG methods either rely solely on text corpora and neglect structural knowledge, or build ad-hoc knowledge graphs (KGs) at high cost and low reliability. To address these issues, we propose KG-Infused RAG, a framework that incorporates pre-existing large-scale KGs into RAG and applies spreading activation to enhance both retrieval and generation. KG-Infused RAG directly performs spreading activation over external KGs to retrieve relevant structured knowledge, which is then used to expand queries and integrated with corpus passages, enabling interpretable and semantically grounded multi-source retrieval. We further improve KG-Infused RAG through preference learning on sampled key stages of the pipeline. Experiments on five QA benchmarks show that KG-Infused RAG consistently outperforms vanilla RAG (by 3.9% to 17.8%). Compared with KG-based approaches such as GraphRAG and LightRAG, our method obtains structured knowledge at lower cost while achieving superior performance. Additionally, integrating KG-Infused RAG with Self-RAG and DeepNote yields further gains, demonstrating its effectiveness and versatility as a plug-and-play enhancement module for corpus-based RAG methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[RAG vs. GraphRAG: A Systematic Evaluation and Key Insights](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11371v2)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances the performance of LLMs across various tasks by retrieving relevant information from external sources, particularly on text-based data. For structured data, such as knowledge graphs, GraphRAG has been widely used to retrieve relevant information. However, recent studies have revealed that structuring implicit knowledge from text into graphs can benefit certain tasks, extending the application of GraphRAG from graph data to general text-based data. Despite their successful extensions, most applications of GraphRAG for text data have been designed for specific tasks and datasets, lacking a systematic evaluation and comparison between RAG and GraphRAG on widely used text-based benchmarks. In this paper, we systematically evaluate RAG and GraphRAG on well-established benchmark tasks, such as Question Answering and Query-based Summarization. Our results highlight the distinct strengths of RAG and GraphRAG across different tasks and evaluation perspectives. Inspired by these observations, we investigate strategies to integrate their strengths to improve downstream tasks. Additionally, we provide an in-depth discussion of the shortcomings of current GraphRAG approaches and outline directions for future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fine-Tuning MedGemma for Clinical Captioning to Enhance Multimodal RAG over Malaysia CPGs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15418v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems are essential for providing fact-based guidance from Malaysian Clinical Practice Guidelines. However, their effectiveness with image-based queries is limited, as general Vision-Language Model captions often lack clinical specificity and factual grounding. This study proposes and validates a framework to specialize the MedGemma model for generating high-fidelity captions that serve as superior queries. To overcome data scarcity, we employ a knowledge distillation pipeline to create a synthetic dataset across dermatology, fundus, and chest radiography domains, and fine-tune MedGemma using the parameter-efficient QLoRA method. Performance was rigorously assessed through a dual framework measuring both classification accuracy and, via a novel application of the RAGAS framework, caption faithfulness, relevancy, and correctness. The fine-tuned model demonstrated substantial improvements in classification performance, while RAGAS evaluation confirmed significant gains in caption faithfulness and correctness, validating the models ability to produce reliable, factually grounded descriptions. This work establishes a robust pipeline for specializing medical VLMs and validates the resulting model as a high-quality query generator, laying the groundwork for enhancing multimodal RAG systems in evidence-based clinical decision support.</p></details> |  |
| **[METIS: Fast Quality-Aware RAG Systems with Configuration Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10543v3)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) allows LLMs (large language models) to generate better responses with external knowledge, but using more external knowledge often improves generation quality at the expense of response delay. Prior work either reduces the response delay (through better scheduling of RAG queries) or strives to maximize quality (which involves tuning the RAG workflow), but they fall short in optimizing the tradeoff between the delay and quality of RAG responses. This paper presents METIS, the first RAG system that jointly schedules queries and adapts the key RAG configurations of each query, such as the number of retrieved text chunks and synthesis methods, in order to balance quality optimization and response delay reduction. Using 4 popular RAG-QA datasets, we show that compared with the state-of-the-art RAG optimization schemes, METIS reduces the generation latency by $1.64-2.54\times$ without sacrificing generation quality.</p></details> | 17 pages, 18 figures |
| **[Unmasking Hiring Bias: Platform Data Analysis and Controlled Experiments on Bias in Online Freelance Marketplaces via RAG-LLM Generated Contents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13091v2)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Online freelance marketplaces, a rapidly growing part of the global labor market, are creating a fair environment where professional skills are the main factor for hiring. While these platforms can reduce bias from traditional hiring, the personal information in user profiles raises concerns about ongoing discrimination. Past studies on this topic have mostly used existing data, which makes it hard to control for other factors and clearly see the effect of things like gender or race. To solve these problems, this paper presents a new method that uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with a Large Language Model (LLM) to create realistic, artificial freelancer profiles for controlled experiments. This approach effectively separates individual factors, enabling a clearer statistical analysis of how different variables influence the freelancer project process. In addition to analyzing extracted data with traditional statistical methods for post-project stage analysis, our research utilizes a dataset with highly controlled variables, generated by an RAG-LLM, to conduct a simulated hiring experiment for pre-project stage analysis. The results of our experiments show that, regarding gender, while no significant preference emerged in initial hiring decisions, female freelancers are substantially more likely to receive imperfect ratings post-project stage. Regarding regional bias, a strong and consistent preference favoring US-based freelancers shows that people are more likely to be selected in the simulated experiments, perceived as more leader-like, and receive higher ratings on the live platform.</p></details> |  |
| **[EviNote-RAG: Enhancing RAG Models via Answer-Supportive Evidence Notes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00877v3)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has advanced open-domain question answering by incorporating external information into model reasoning. However, effectively leveraging external information to enhance reasoning presents the following challenges: (1) low signal-to-noise ratio, where answer-supportive external information is diluted by irrelevant material, and (2) error accumulation, which arises in multi-hop reasoning when incomplete or misleading information is incorporated. To address these challenges, we introduce EviNote-RAG, a framework that follows a retrieve-note-answer workflow. Instead of reasoning directly over raw external information, the model first produces Supportive-Evidence Notes (SENs), which concisely preserve answer-critical information and explicitly mark key and uncertainty information to improve accuracy. We further design an entailment-based Evidence Quality Reward (EQR) to ensure that SENs are logically sufficient to derive the final answer, thereby enhancing SENs' quality. Experiments on both in-domain and out-of-domain QA benchmarks show that EviNote-RAG achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving answer accuracy, training stability, robustness, and efficiency. In particular, it yields relative F1 gains of 20% on HotpotQA (+0.093), 40% on Bamboogle (+0.151), and 91% on 2Wiki (+0.256), benefiting from improvements in the reasoning process.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal RAG for Unstructured Data:Leveraging Modality-Aware Knowledge Graphs with Hybrid Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14592v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems primarily operate on unimodal textual data, limiting their effectiveness on unstructured multimodal documents. Such documents often combine text, images, tables, equations, and graphs, each contributing unique information. In this work, we present a Modality-Aware Hybrid retrieval Architecture (MAHA), designed specifically for multimodal question answering with reasoning through a modality-aware knowledge graph. MAHA integrates dense vector retrieval with structured graph traversal, where the knowledge graph encodes cross-modal semantics and relationships. This design enables both semantically rich and context-aware retrieval across diverse modalities. Evaluations on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that MAHA substantially outperforms baseline methods, achieving a ROUGE-L score of 0.486, providing complete modality coverage. These results highlight MAHA's ability to combine embeddings with explicit document structure, enabling effective multimodal retrieval. Our work establishes a scalable and interpretable retrieval framework that advances RAG systems by enabling modality-aware reasoning over unstructured multimodal data.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 6 figures, submitted for review</p></details> |
| **[ReMindRAG: Low-Cost LLM-Guided Knowledge Graph Traversal for Efficient RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13193v2)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge graphs (KGs), with their structured representation capabilities, offer promising avenue for enhancing Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, leading to the development of KG-RAG systems. Nevertheless, existing methods often struggle to achieve effective synergy between system effectiveness and cost efficiency, leading to neither unsatisfying performance nor excessive LLM prompt tokens and inference time. To this end, this paper proposes REMINDRAG, which employs an LLM-guided graph traversal featuring node exploration, node exploitation, and, most notably, memory replay, to improve both system effectiveness and cost efficiency. Specifically, REMINDRAG memorizes traversal experience within KG edge embeddings, mirroring the way LLMs "memorize" world knowledge within their parameters, but in a train-free manner. We theoretically and experimentally confirm the effectiveness of REMINDRAG, demonstrating its superiority over existing baselines across various benchmark datasets and LLM backbones. Our code is available at https://github.com/kilgrims/ReMindRAG.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Stop-RAG: Value-Based Retrieval Control for Iterative RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14337v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Iterative retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enables large language models to answer complex multi-hop questions, but each additional loop increases latency, costs, and the risk of introducing distracting evidence, motivating the need for an efficient stopping strategy. Existing methods either use a predetermined number of iterations or rely on confidence proxies that poorly reflect whether more retrieval will actually help. We cast iterative RAG as a finite-horizon Markov decision process and introduce Stop-RAG, a value-based controller that adaptively decides when to stop retrieving. Trained with full-width forward-view Q($\lambda$) targets from complete trajectories, Stop-RAG learns effective stopping policies while remaining compatible with black-box APIs and existing pipelines. On multi-hop question-answering benchmarks, Stop-RAG consistently outperforms both fixed-iteration baselines and prompting-based stopping with LLMs. These results highlight adaptive stopping as a key missing component in current agentic systems, and demonstrate that value-based control can improve the accuracy of RAG systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 MTI-LLM Workshop</p></details> |
| **[RAG Meets Temporal Graphs: Time-Sensitive Modeling and Retrieval for Evolving Knowledge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13590v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge is inherently time-sensitive and continuously evolves over time. Although current Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enrich LLMs with external knowledge, they largely ignore this temporal nature. This raises two challenges for RAG. First, current RAG methods lack effective time-aware representations. Same facts of different time are difficult to distinguish with vector embeddings or conventional knowledge graphs. Second, most RAG evaluations assume a static corpus, leaving a blind spot regarding update costs and retrieval stability as knowledge evolves. To make RAG time-aware, we propose Temporal GraphRAG (TG-RAG), which models external corpora as a bi-level temporal graph consisting of a temporal knowledge graph with timestamped relations and a hierarchical time graph. Multi-granularity temporal summaries are generated for each time node to capture both key events and broader trends at that time. The design supports incremental updates by extracting new temporal facts from the incoming corpus and merging them into the existing graph. The temporal graph explicitly represents identical facts at different times as distinct edges to avoid ambiguity, and the time hierarchy graph allows only generating reports for new leaf time nodes and their ancestors, ensuring effective and efficient updates. During inference, TG-RAG dynamically retrieves a subgraph within the temporal and semantic scope of the query, enabling precise evidence gathering. Moreover, we introduce ECT-QA, a time-sensitive question-answering dataset featuring both specific and abstract queries, along with a comprehensive evaluation protocol designed to assess incremental update capabilities of RAG systems. Extensive experiments show that TG-RAG significantly outperforms existing baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method in handling temporal knowledge and incremental updates.</p></details> |  |
| **[SeCon-RAG: A Two-Stage Semantic Filtering and Conflict-Free Framework for Trustworthy RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09710v2)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems enhance large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge but are vulnerable to corpus poisoning and contamination attacks, which can compromise output integrity. Existing defenses often apply aggressive filtering, leading to unnecessary loss of valuable information and reduced reliability in generation. To address this problem, we propose a two-stage semantic filtering and conflict-free framework for trustworthy RAG. In the first stage, we perform a joint filter with semantic and cluster-based filtering which is guided by the Entity-intent-relation extractor (EIRE). EIRE extracts entities, latent objectives, and entity relations from both the user query and filtered documents, scores their semantic relevance, and selectively adds valuable documents into the clean retrieval database. In the second stage, we proposed an EIRE-guided conflict-aware filtering module, which analyzes semantic consistency between the query, candidate answers, and retrieved knowledge before final answer generation, filtering out internal and external contradictions that could mislead the model. Through this two-stage process, SeCon-RAG effectively preserves useful knowledge while mitigating conflict contamination, achieving significant improvements in both generation robustness and output trustworthiness. Extensive experiments across various LLMs and datasets demonstrate that the proposed SeCon-RAG markedly outperforms state-of-the-art defense methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[RAG-Anything: All-in-One RAG Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12323v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a fundamental paradigm for expanding Large Language Models beyond their static training limitations. However, a critical misalignment exists between current RAG capabilities and real-world information environments. Modern knowledge repositories are inherently multimodal, containing rich combinations of textual content, visual elements, structured tables, and mathematical expressions. Yet existing RAG frameworks are limited to textual content, creating fundamental gaps when processing multimodal documents. We present RAG-Anything, a unified framework that enables comprehensive knowledge retrieval across all modalities. Our approach reconceptualizes multimodal content as interconnected knowledge entities rather than isolated data types. The framework introduces dual-graph construction to capture both cross-modal relationships and textual semantics within a unified representation. We develop cross-modal hybrid retrieval that combines structural knowledge navigation with semantic matching. This enables effective reasoning over heterogeneous content where relevant evidence spans multiple modalities. RAG-Anything demonstrates superior performance on challenging multimodal benchmarks, achieving significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods. Performance gains become particularly pronounced on long documents where traditional approaches fail. Our framework establishes a new paradigm for multimodal knowledge access, eliminating the architectural fragmentation that constrains current systems. Our framework is open-sourced at: https://github.com/HKUDS/RAG-Anything.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beating Harmful Stereotypes Through Facts: RAG-based Counter-speech Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12316v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Counter-speech generation is at the core of many expert activities, such as fact-checking and hate speech, to counter harmful content. Yet, existing work treats counter-speech generation as pure text generation task, mainly based on Large Language Models or NGO experts. These approaches show severe drawbacks due to the limited reliability and coherence in the generated countering text, and in scalability, respectively. To close this gap, we introduce a novel framework to model counter-speech generation as knowledge-wise text generation process. Our framework integrates advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines to ensure the generation of trustworthy counter-speech for 8 main target groups identified in the hate speech literature, including women, people of colour, persons with disabilities, migrants, Muslims, Jews, LGBT persons, and other. We built a knowledge base over the United Nations Digital Library, EUR-Lex and the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights, comprising a total of 32,792 texts. We use the MultiTarget-CONAN dataset to empirically assess the quality of the generated counter-speech, both through standard metrics (i.e., JudgeLM) and a human evaluation. Results show that our framework outperforms standard LLM baselines and competitive approach, on both assessments. The resulting framework and the knowledge base pave the way for studying trustworthy and sound counter-speech generation, in hate speech and beyond.</p></details> |  |
| **[LUMINA: Detecting Hallucinations in RAG System with Context-Knowledge Signals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21875v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) aims to mitigate hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) by grounding responses in retrieved documents. Yet, RAG-based LLMs still hallucinate even when provided with correct and sufficient context. A growing line of work suggests that this stems from an imbalance between how models use external context and their internal knowledge, and several approaches have attempted to quantify these signals for hallucination detection. However, existing methods require extensive hyperparameter tuning, limiting their generalizability. We propose LUMINA, a novel framework that detects hallucinations in RAG systems through context-knowledge signals: external context utilization is quantified via distributional distance, while internal knowledge utilization is measured by tracking how predicted tokens evolve across transformer layers. We further introduce a framework for statistically validating these measurements. Experiments on common RAG hallucination benchmarks and four open-source LLMs show that LUMINA achieves consistently high AUROC and AUPRC scores, outperforming prior utilization-based methods by up to +13% AUROC on HalluRAG. Moreover, LUMINA remains robust under relaxed assumptions about retrieval quality and model matching, offering both effectiveness and practicality.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Longitudinal Study on Different Annotator Feedback Loops in Complex RAG Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11897v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Grounding conversations in existing passages, known as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), is an important aspect of Chat-Based Assistants powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) to ensure they are faithful and don't provide misinformation. Several benchmarks have been created to measure the performance of LLMs on this task. We present a longitudinal study comparing the feedback loop of an internal and external human annotator group for the complex annotation task of creating multi-turn RAG conversations for evaluating LLMs. We analyze the conversations produced by both groups and provide results of a survey comparing their experiences. Our study highlights the advantages of each annotator population and the impact of the different feedback loops; a closer loop creates higher quality conversations with a decrease in quantity and diversity. Further, we present guidance for how to best utilize two different population groups when performing annotation tasks, particularly when the task is complex.</p></details> | 26 pages |
| **[FinVet: A Collaborative Framework of RAG and External Fact-Checking Agents for Financial Misinformation Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11654v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Financial markets face growing threats from misinformation that can trigger billions in losses in minutes. Most existing approaches lack transparency in their decision-making and provide limited attribution to credible sources. We introduce FinVet, a novel multi-agent framework that integrates two Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines with external fact-checking through a confidence-weighted voting mechanism. FinVet employs adaptive three-tier processing that dynamically adjusts verification strategies based on retrieval confidence, from direct metadata extraction to hybrid reasoning to full model-based analysis. Unlike existing methods, FinVet provides evidence-backed verdicts, source attribution, confidence scores, and explicit uncertainty flags when evidence is insufficient. Experimental evaluation on the FinFact dataset shows that FinVet achieves an F1 score of 0.85, which is a 10.4% improvement over the best individual pipeline (fact-check pipeline) and 37% improvement over standalone RAG approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Domain-Specific Data Generation Framework for RAG Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11217v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) combines the language understanding and reasoning power of large language models (LLMs) with external retrieval to enable domain-grounded responses. Effectively adapting RAG systems to domain-specific settings requires specialized, context-rich training data beyond general-purpose question-answering. Here, we propose RAGen, a scalable and modular framework for generating domain-grounded question-answer-context (QAC) triples tailored to diverse RAG adaptation approaches. RAGen produces these QAC triples by identifying key concepts in documents, generating diverse questions guided by Bloom's Taxonomy-inspired principles, and pairing them with precise answers extracted from relevant contexts. RAGen supports multiple RAG adaptation strategies, including the optimization of key components such as the LLM, retriever, and embedding model, etc. Its modular pipeline features semantic chunking, hierarchical concept extraction, and multi-chunk retrieval, along with the introduction of curated distractor contexts to promote robust reasoning. Designed for scalability, RAGen efficiently handles large and evolving document corpora without redundant processing, making it especially suitable for dynamic evolving domains such as scientific research and enterprise knowledge bases.</p></details> |  |
| **[RAG-Pull: Imperceptible Attacks on RAG Systems for Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11195v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) increases the reliability and trustworthiness of the LLM response and reduces hallucination by eliminating the need for model retraining. It does so by adding external data into the LLM's context. We develop a new class of black-box attack, RAG-Pull, that inserts hidden UTF characters into queries or external code repositories, redirecting retrieval toward malicious code, thereby breaking the models' safety alignment. We observe that query and code perturbations alone can shift retrieval toward attacker-controlled snippets, while combined query-and-target perturbations achieve near-perfect success. Once retrieved, these snippets introduce exploitable vulnerabilities such as remote code execution and SQL injection. RAG-Pull's minimal perturbations can alter the model's safety alignment and increase preference towards unsafe code, therefore opening up a new class of attacks on LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Chronological Passage Assembling in RAG framework for Temporal Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18748v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-context question answering over narrative tasks is challenging because correct answers often hinge on reconstructing a coherent timeline of events while preserving contextual f low in a limited context window. Retrievalaugmented generation (RAG) methods aim to address this challenge by selectively retrieving only necessary document segments. However, narrative texts possess unique characteristics that limit the effectiveness of these existing approaches. Specifically, understanding narrative texts requires more than isolated segments, as the broader context and sequential relationships between segments are crucial for comprehension. To address these limitations, we propose ChronoRAG, a novel RAG framework specialized for narrative texts. This approach focuses on two essential aspects: refining dispersed document information into coherent and structured passages and preserving narrative flow by explicitly capturing and maintaining the temporal order among retrieved passages. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of ChronoRAG through experiments on the NarrativeQA and GutenQAdataset, showing substantial improvements in tasks requiring both factual identification and comprehension of complex sequential relationships, underscoring that reasoning over temporal order is crucial in resolving narrative QA.</p></details> | 15 pages, 4 figures |
| **[When Machine Unlearning Meets Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): Keep Secret or Forget Knowledge?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15267v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The deployment of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and Gemini has shown their powerful natural language generation capabilities. However, these models can inadvertently learn and retain sensitive information and harmful content during training, raising significant ethical and legal concerns. To address these issues, machine unlearning has been introduced as a potential solution. While existing unlearning methods take into account the specific characteristics of LLMs, they often suffer from high computational demands, limited applicability, or the risk of catastrophic forgetting. To address these limitations, we propose a lightweight behavioral unlearning framework based on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology. By modifying the external knowledge base of RAG, we simulate the effects of forgetting without directly interacting with the unlearned LLM. We approach the construction of unlearned knowledge as a constrained optimization problem, deriving two key components that underpin the effectiveness of RAG-based unlearning. This RAG-based approach is particularly effective for closed-source LLMs, where existing unlearning methods often fail. We evaluate our framework through extensive experiments on both open-source and closed-source models, including ChatGPT, Gemini, Llama-2-7b-chat, and PaLM 2. The results demonstrate that our approach meets five key unlearning criteria: effectiveness, universality, harmlessness, simplicity, and robustness. Meanwhile, this approach can extend to multimodal large language models and LLM-based agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 9 figures, 13 tables.

| **[VeritasFi: An Adaptable, Multi-tiered RAG Framework for Multi-modal Financial Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10828v1)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is becoming increasingly essential for Question Answering (QA) in the financial sector, where accurate and contextually grounded insights from complex public disclosures are crucial. However, existing financial RAG systems face two significant challenges: (1) they struggle to process heterogeneous data formats, such as text, tables, and figures; and (2) they encounter difficulties in balancing general-domain applicability with company-specific adaptation. To overcome these challenges, we present VeritasFi, an innovative hybrid RAG framework that incorporates a multi-modal preprocessing pipeline alongside a cutting-edge two-stage training strategy for its re-ranking component. VeritasFi enhances financial QA through three key innovations: (1) A multi-modal preprocessing pipeline that seamlessly transforms heterogeneous data into a coherent, machine-readable format. (2) A tripartite hybrid retrieval engine that operates in parallel, combining deep multi-path retrieval over a semantically indexed document corpus, real-time data acquisition through tool utilization, and an expert-curated memory bank for high-frequency questions, ensuring comprehensive scope, accuracy, and efficiency. (3) A two-stage training strategy for the document re-ranker, which initially constructs a general, domain-specific model using anonymized data, followed by rapid fine-tuning on company-specific data for targeted applications. By integrating our proposed designs, VeritasFi presents a groundbreaking framework that greatly enhances the adaptability and robustness of financial RAG systems, providing a scalable solution for both general-domain and company-specific QA tasks. Code accompanying this work is available at https://github.com/simplew4y/VeritasFi.git.</p></details> |  |

We combine autonomous AI agents with hybrid vector-graph knowledge systems to automate test plan, case, and QE metric generation. Our approach addresses traditional software testing limitations by leveraging LLMs such as Gemini and Mistral, multi-agent orchestration, and enhanced contextualization. The system achieves remarkable accuracy improvements from 65% to 94.8% while ensuring comprehensive document traceability throughout the quality engineering lifecycle. Experimental validation of enterprise Corporate Systems Engineering and SAP migration projects demonstrates an 85% reduction in testing timeline, an 85% improvement in test suite efficiency, and projected 35% cost savings, resulting in a 2-month acceleration of go-live.</p></details> |  |
| **[Is Implicit Knowledge Enough for LLMs? A RAG Approach for Tree-based Structures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10806v1)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are adept at generating responses based on information within their context. While this ability is useful for interacting with structured data like code files, another popular method, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), retrieves relevant documents to augment the model's in-context learning. However, it is not well-explored how to best represent this retrieved knowledge for generating responses on structured data, particularly hierarchical structures like trees. In this work, we propose a novel bottom-up method to linearize knowledge from tree-like structures (like a GitHub repository) by generating implicit, aggregated summaries at each hierarchical level. This approach enables the knowledge to be stored in a knowledge base and used directly with RAG. We then compare our method to using RAG on raw, unstructured code, evaluating the accuracy and quality of the generated responses. Our results show that while response quality is comparable across both methods, our approach generates over 68% fewer documents in the retriever, a significant gain in efficiency. This finding suggests that leveraging implicit, linearized knowledge may be a highly effective and scalable strategy for handling complex, hierarchical data structures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Waiti...</summary><p>Waiting for Conference Response</p></details> |
| **[Review of Inference-Time Scaling Strategies: Reasoning, Search and RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10787v1)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The performance gains of LLMs have historically been driven by scaling up model size and training data. However, the rapidly diminishing availability of high-quality training data is introducing a fundamental bottleneck, shifting the focus of research toward inference-time scaling. This paradigm uses additional computation at the time of deployment to substantially improve LLM performance on downstream tasks without costly model re-training. This review systematically surveys the diverse techniques contributing to this new era of inference-time scaling, organizing the rapidly evolving field into two comprehensive perspectives: Output-focused and Input-focused methods. Output-focused techniques encompass complex, multi-step generation strategies, including reasoning (e.g., CoT, ToT, ReAct), various search and decoding methods (e.g., MCTS, beam search), training for long CoT (e.g., RLVR, GRPO), and model ensemble methods. Input-focused techniques are primarily categorized by few-shot and RAG, with RAG as the central focus. The RAG section is further detailed through a structured examination of query expansion, data, retrieval and reranker, LLM generation methods, and multi-modal RAG.</p></details> |  |
| **[REFRAG: Rethinking RAG based Decoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01092v2)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in leveraging extensive external knowledge to enhance responses in multi-turn and agentic applications, such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). However, processing long-context inputs introduces significant system latency and demands substantial memory for the key-value cache, resulting in reduced throughput and a fundamental trade-off between knowledge enrichment and system efficiency. While minimizing latency for long-context inputs is a primary objective for LLMs, we contend that RAG require specialized consideration. In RAG, much of the LLM context consists of concatenated passages from retrieval, with only a small subset directly relevant to the query. These passages often exhibit low semantic similarity due to diversity or deduplication during re-ranking, leading to block-diagonal attention patterns that differ from those in standard LLM generation tasks. Based on this observation, we argue that most computations over the RAG context during decoding are unnecessary and can be eliminated with minimal impact on performance. To this end, we propose REFRAG, an efficient decoding framework that compresses, senses, and expands to improve latency in RAG applications. By exploiting the sparsity structure, we demonstrate a 30.85 the time-to-first-token acceleration (3.75 improvement to previous work) without loss in perplexity. In addition, our optimization framework for large context enables REFRAG to extend the context size of LLMs by 16. We provide rigorous validation of REFRAG across diverse long-context tasks, including RAG, multi-turn conversations, and long document summarization, spanning a wide range of datasets. Experimental results confirm that REFRAG delivers substantial speedup with no loss in accuracy compared to LLaMA models and other state-of-the-art baselines across various context sizes.</p></details> | <details><summary>fix t...</summary><p>fix typo perplexity->log perplexity; added recent papers</p></details> |
| **[Lightweight Joint Optimization of General-Purpose Vision-Language Models and Retrievers for RAG-Based Medical Diagnosis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17394v3)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieving relevant visual and textual information from medical literature and hospital records can enhance diagnostic accuracy for clinical image interpretation. We develop a multimodal retrieval model jointly optimized with an LVLM for medical diagnosis, unlike standard RAG which doesn't backpropagate LVLM errors to the retriever. Using only general-purpose backbones with lightweight fine-tuning, our model achieves competitive results with medically-pretrained models on clinical classification and VQA tasks. In a novel analysis, we find that different top-retrieved images often yield different predictions for the same target, and that these cases are challenging for all models, even for non-retrieval models. Our joint retrieval optimization significantly improves these cases over standard RAG. However, oracle analysis reveals that while the correct diagnosis is frequently achievable using one of the top retrieved images, in practice there is a large performance gap from the oracle, and rerankers using frontier LVLMs do not close this gap -- leaving ample room for improvement by future methods.

| **[Can Compact Language Models Search Like Agents? Distillation-Guided Policy Optimization for Preserving Agentic RAG Capabilities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20324v3)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning has emerged as a dominant post-training approach to elicit agentic RAG behaviors such as search and planning from language models. Despite its success with larger models, applying RL to compact models (e.g., 0.5--1B parameters) presents unique challenges. The compact models exhibit poor initial performance, resulting in sparse rewards and unstable training. To overcome these difficulties, we propose Distillation-Guided Policy Optimization (DGPO), which employs cold-start initialization from teacher demonstrations and continuous teacher guidance during policy optimization. To understand how compact models preserve agentic behavior, we introduce Agentic RAG Capabilities (ARC), a fine-grained metric analyzing reasoning, search coordination, and response synthesis. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that DGPO enables compact models to achieve sophisticated agentic search behaviors, even outperforming the larger teacher model in some cases. DGPO makes agentic RAG feasible in computing resource-constrained environments.</p></details> |  |

Prior work highlights LLMs' susceptibility to misleading or malicious retrieved content. However, real-world fact-checking scenarios are more challenging, as credible evidence typically dominates the retrieval pool. To investigate this problem, we extend knowledge poisoning to the fact-checking setting, where retrieved context includes authentic supporting or refuting evidence. We propose \textbf{ADMIT} (\textbf{AD}versarial \textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{I}njection \textbf{T}echnique), a few-shot, semantically aligned poisoning attack that flips fact-checking decisions and induces deceptive justifications, all without access to the target LLMs, retrievers, or token-level control. Extensive experiments show that ADMIT transfers effectively across 4 retrievers, 11 LLMs, and 4 cross-domain benchmarks, achieving an average attack success rate (ASR) of 86\% at an extremely low poisoning rate of $0.93 \times 10^{-6}$, and remaining robust even in the presence of strong counter-evidence. Compared with prior state-of-the-art attacks, ADMIT improves ASR by 11.2\% across all settings, exposing significant vulnerabilities in real-world RAG-based fact-checking systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[CacheClip: Accelerating RAG with Effective KV Cache Reuse](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10129v1)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems suffer from severe time-to-first-token (TTFT) bottlenecks due to long input sequences. Existing KV cache reuse methods face a fundamental trade-off: prefix caching requires identical prefixes that rarely occur in RAG scenarios, while direct precomputation sacrifices quality due to missing inter-chunk attention and repeated attention sinks. Recent methods like APE and CacheBlend partially address these issues but remain inadequate for robust RAG applications. This paper presents CacheClip, a novel framework that achieves both fast TTFT and high generation quality. Our key insight is that small auxiliary LLMs exhibit similar last-layer attention distributions to primary LLMs (the target model for generation), enabling efficient identification of tokens critical for restoring inter-chunk attention, thereby significantly improving response quality on cross-chunk reasoning tasks. CacheClip integrates three techniques: (1) auxiliary-model-guided token selection for selective KV cache recomputation, where the auxiliary model is finetuned to improve selection accuracy, (2) shared prefixes to eliminate redundant attention sinks, and (3) grouping strategy to maintain local coherence during partial KV cache updates. Experiments show CacheClip retains up to 94.8% and 85.0% of full-attention performance on NIAH and LongBench, outperforming APE and CacheBlend by 25.2% and 35.1% on NIAH (with reomp% = 20%). Meanwhile, CacheClip accelerates LLM inference by up to 1.92x in prefill time, providing a practical solution to the efficiency-quality trade-off in RAG systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Transparent and Robust RAG: Adaptive-Reward Reinforcement Learning for Decision Traceability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13258v2)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) delivers substantial value in knowledge-intensive applications. Many recent works use reinforcement learning (RL) to elicit strong reasoning in RAG generators. However, two key challenges remain unresolved: (1) Transparency: most prior methods do not explicitly indicate which references are actually used during the reasoning that leads to the final answer, limiting interpretability and visibility; (2) Stability: the KL divergence estimator used in existing RL-based approaches may cause gradient spikes, leading to unstable training. To address these challenges, we propose Adaptive-Rewarded Evidence Navigation Agent (ARENA), a transparent and robust RAG generator framework trained via RL with designed rewards. Based on our structured protocol, KL divergence stabilization, and adaptive reward calculation modules, ARENA enables the RAG generator to identify key evidence, perform structured reasoning, and generate answers with interpretable decision traces. Applied to Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct and Llama3.1-8B-Instruct, extensive experiments across multiple baselines show 10-30% accuracy improvements on three multi-hop QA datasets, comparable to advanced closed-source LLMs (e.g., OpenAI o1, DeepSeek R1). Further analyses show that ARENA generalizes well to unseen datasets and tasks. Our models and codes are publicly released.</p></details> |  |
| **[Retrieval is Not Enough: Enhancing RAG Reasoning through Test-Time Critique and Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14858v4)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become a widely adopted paradigm for enabling knowledge-grounded large language models (LLMs). However, standard RAG pipelines often fail to ensure that model reasoning remains consistent with the evidence retrieved, leading to factual inconsistencies or unsupported conclusions. In this work, we reinterpret RAG as Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning and identify a central but underexplored problem: Reasoning Misalignment -- the divergence between an LLM's internal reasoning trajectory and the evidential constraints provided by retrieval. To address this issue, we propose AlignRAG, a novel iterative framework grounded in Critique-Driven Alignment (CDA). We further introduce AlignRAG-auto, an autonomous variant that dynamically terminates refinement, removing the need to pre-specify the number of critique iterations. At the heart of AlignRAG lies a contrastive critique synthesis mechanism that generates retrieval-sensitive critiques while mitigating self-bias. This mechanism trains a dedicated retrieval-augmented Critic Language Model (CLM) using labeled critiques that distinguish between evidence-aligned and misaligned reasoning. Empirical evaluations show that our approach significantly improves reasoning fidelity. Our 8B-parameter CLM improves performance over the Self-Refine baseline by 12.1% on out-of-domain tasks and outperforms a standard 72B-parameter CLM by 2.2%. Furthermore, AlignRAG-auto achieves this state-of-the-art performance while dynamically determining the optimal number of refinement steps, enhancing efficiency and usability. AlignRAG remains compatible with existing RAG architectures as a plug-and-play module and demonstrates strong robustness under both informative and noisy retrieval scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

Inspired by this mechanism, we introduce EcphoryRAG, an entity-centric knowledge graph RAG framework. During indexing, EcphoryRAG extracts and stores only core entities with corresponding metadata, a lightweight approach that reduces token consumption by up to 94\% compared to other structured RAG systems. For retrieval, the system first extracts cue entities from queries, then performs a scalable multi-hop associative search across the knowledge graph. Crucially, EcphoryRAG dynamically infers implicit relations between entities to populate context, enabling deep reasoning without exhaustive pre-enumeration of relationships. Extensive evaluations on the 2WikiMultiHop, HotpotQA, and MuSiQue benchmarks demonstrate that EcphoryRAG sets a new state-of-the-art, improving the average Exact Match (EM) score from 0.392 to 0.474 over strong KG-RAG methods like HippoRAG. These results validate the efficacy of the entity-cue-multi-hop retrieval paradigm for complex question answering.</p></details> |  |
| **[UNIDOC-BENCH: A Unified Benchmark for Document-Centric Multimodal RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03663v2)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal retrieval-augmented generation (MM-RAG) is a key approach for applying large language models (LLMs) and agents to real-world knowledge bases, yet current evaluations are fragmented, focusing on either text or images in isolation or on simplified multimodal setups that fail to capture document-centric multimodal use cases. In this paper, we introduce UniDoc-Bench, the first large-scale, realistic benchmark for MM-RAG built from 70k real-world PDF pages across eight domains. Our pipeline extracts and links evidence from text, tables, and figures, then generates 1,600 multimodal QA pairs spanning factual retrieval, comparison, summarization, and logical reasoning queries. To ensure reliability, 20% of QA pairs are validated by multiple annotators and expert adjudication. UniDoc-Bench supports apples-to-apples comparison across four paradigms: (1) text-only, (2) image-only, (3) multimodal text-image fusion, and (4) multimodal joint retrieval -- under a unified protocol with standardized candidate pools, prompts, and evaluation metrics. Our experiments show that multimodal text-image fusion RAG systems consistently outperform both unimodal and jointly multimodal embedding-based retrieval, indicating that neither text nor images alone are sufficient and that current multimodal embeddings remain inadequate. Beyond benchmarking, our analysis reveals when and how visual context complements textual evidence, uncovers systematic failure modes, and offers actionable guidance for developing more robust MM-RAG pipelines.</p></details> |  |

A Method for Detecting Unauthorized RAG Theft](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07728v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by mitigating hallucinations and outdated information issues, yet simultaneously facilitates unauthorized data appropriation at scale. This paper addresses this challenge through two key contributions. First, we introduce RPD, a novel dataset specifically designed for RAG plagiarism detection that encompasses diverse professional domains and writing styles, overcoming limitations in existing resources. Second, we develop a dual-layered watermarking system that embeds protection at both semantic and lexical levels, complemented by an interrogator-detective framework that employs statistical hypothesis testing on accumulated evidence. Extensive experimentation demonstrates our approach's effectiveness across varying query volumes, defense prompts, and retrieval parameters, while maintaining resilience against adversarial evasion techniques. This work establishes a foundational framework for intellectual property protection in retrieval-augmented AI systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[SUBQRAG: sub-question driven dynamic graph rag](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07718v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Graph RAG) effectively builds a knowledge graph (KG) to connect disparate facts across a large document corpus. However, this broad-view approach often lacks the deep structured reasoning needed for complex multi-hop question answering (QA), leading to incomplete evidence and error accumulation. To address these limitations, we propose SubQRAG, a sub-question-driven framework that enhances reasoning depth. SubQRAG decomposes a complex question into an ordered chain of verifiable sub-questions. For each sub-question, it retrieves relevant triples from the graph. When the existing graph is insufficient, the system dynamically expands it by extracting new triples from source documents in real time. All triples used in the reasoning process are aggregated into a "graph memory," forming a structured and traceable evidence path for final answer generation. Experiments on three multi-hop QA benchmarks demonstrate that SubQRAG achieves consistent and significant improvements, especially in Exact Match scores.</p></details> | 5 pages, 1 figure |
| **[Efficient and Transferable Agentic Knowledge Graph RAG via Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26383v3)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge-graph retrieval-augmented generation (KG-RAG) couples large language models (LLMs) with structured, verifiable knowledge graphs (KGs) to reduce hallucinations and expose reasoning traces. However, many KG-RAG systems compose multiple LLM modules (e.g planning, reasoning, and responding), inflating inference cost and binding behavior to a specific target KG. To address this, we introduce KG-R1, an agentic KG retrieval-augmented generation (KG-RAG) framework through reinforcement learning (RL). KG-R1 utilizes a single agent that interacts with KGs as its environment, learning to retrieve at each step and incorporating the retrieved information into its reasoning and generation. The process is optimized through end-to-end RL. In controlled experiments across Knowledge-Graph Question Answering (KGQA) benchmarks, our method demonstrates both efficiency and transferability: Using Qwen-2.5-3B, KG-R1 improves answer accuracy with fewer generation tokens than prior multi-module workflow methods that use larger foundation or fine-tuned models. Furthermore, KG-R1 enables plug and play: after training, it maintains strong accuracy on new KGs without modification. These properties make KG-R1 a promising KG-RAG framework for real-world deployment. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/Jinyeop3110/KG-R1.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures. Submitted to ICLR 2026</p></details> |

However, conventional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods encode content in isolated chunks during ingestion, losing structural and cross-page dependencies, and retrieve a fixed number of pages at inference, regardless of the specific demands of the question or context. This often results in incomplete evidence retrieval and degraded answer quality for multi-page reasoning tasks. To address these limitations, we propose LAD-RAG, a novel Layout-Aware Dynamic RAG framework. During ingestion, LAD-RAG constructs a symbolic document graph that captures layout structure and cross-page dependencies, adding it alongside standard neural embeddings to yield a more holistic representation of the document. During inference, an LLM agent dynamically interacts with the neural and symbolic indices to adaptively retrieve the necessary evidence based on the query. Experiments on MMLongBench-Doc, LongDocURL, DUDE, and MP-DocVQA demonstrate that LAD-RAG improves retrieval, achieving over 90% perfect recall on average without any top-k tuning, and outperforming baseline retrievers by up to 20% in recall at comparable noise levels, yielding higher QA accuracy with minimal latency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Reliable Retrieval in RAG Systems for Large Legal Datasets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06999v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a promising approach to mitigate hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) for legal applications, but its reliability is critically dependent on the accuracy of the retrieval step. This is particularly challenging in the legal domain, where large databases of structurally similar documents often cause retrieval systems to fail. In this paper, we address this challenge by first identifying and quantifying a critical failure mode we term Document-Level Retrieval Mismatch (DRM), where the retriever selects information from entirely incorrect source documents. To mitigate DRM, we investigate a simple and computationally efficient technique which we refer to as Summary-Augmented Chunking (SAC). This method enhances each text chunk with a document-level synthetic summary, thereby injecting crucial global context that would otherwise be lost during a standard chunking process. Our experiments on a diverse set of legal information retrieval tasks show that SAC greatly reduces DRM and, consequently, also improves text-level retrieval precision and recall. Interestingly, we find that a generic summarization strategy outperforms an approach that incorporates legal expert domain knowledge to target specific legal elements. Our work provides evidence that this practical, scalable, and easily integrable technique enhances the reliability of RAG systems when applied to large-scale legal document datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for the 7th Natural Legal Language Processing Workshop (NLLP 2025), co-located with EMNLP 2025</p></details> |

However, its application in sensitive domains is limited by privacy risks. Existing private RAG methods typically rely on query-time differential privacy (DP), which requires repeated noise injection and leads to accumulated privacy loss. To address this issue, we propose DP-SynRAG, a framework that uses LLMs to generate differentially private synthetic RAG databases. Unlike prior methods, the synthetic text can be reused once created, thereby avoiding repeated noise injection and additional privacy costs. To preserve essential information for downstream RAG tasks, DP-SynRAG extends private prediction, which instructs LLMs to generate text that mimics subsampled database records in a DP manner. Experiments show that DP-SynRAG achieves superior performanec to the state-of-the-art private RAG systems while maintaining a fixed privacy budget, offering a scalable solution for privacy-preserving RAG.</p></details> | Under review |

This grounding improves factuality, reduces hallucination, and extends reasoning beyond parametric knowledge. However, this reliance on external knowledge poses a critical yet underexplored safety risk: knowledge poisoning attacks, where adversaries deliberately inject adversarial multimodal content into external knowledge bases to steer model toward generating incorrect or even harmful responses. To expose such vulnerabilities, we propose MM-PoisonRAG, the first framework to systematically design knowledge poisoning in multimodal RAG. We introduce two complementary attack strategies: Localized Poisoning Attack (LPA), which implants targeted multimodal misinformation to manipulate specific queries, and Globalized Poisoning Attack (GPA), which inserts a single adversarial knowledge to broadly disrupt reasoning and induce nonsensical responses across all queries. Comprehensive experiments across tasks, models, and access settings show that LPA achieves targeted manipulation with attack success rates of up to 56%, while GPA completely disrupts model generation to 0% accuracy with just a single adversarial knowledge injection. Our results reveal the fragility of multimodal RAG and highlight the urgent need for defenses against knowledge poisoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is available at https://github.com/HyeonjeongHa/MM-PoisonRAG</p></details> |

However, a critical gap remains: how to reliably query this structured knowledge without sacrificing its deterministic properties. This paper introduces the SAT-Graph API, a formal query execution layer centered on canonical actions-atomic, composable, and auditable primitives that isolate probabilistic discovery from deterministic retrieval. These actions enable: (i) high-precision hybrid search; (ii) robust reference resolution; (iii) point-in-time version retrieval; and (iv) auditable causal tracing. We demonstrate how planner-guided agents can decompose complex queries into Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) of these actions. This two-layer architecture transforms retrieval from an opaque black box to a transparent, auditable process, directly addressing Explainable AI (XAI) requirements for high-stakes domains.</p></details> |  |

This raises a critical question: Is GraphRAG really effective, and in which scenarios do graph structures provide measurable benefits for RAG systems? To address this, we propose GraphRAG-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate GraphRAG models onboth hierarchical knowledge retrieval and deep contextual reasoning. GraphRAG-Bench features a comprehensive dataset with tasks of increasing difficulty, coveringfact retrieval, complex reasoning, contextual summarization, and creative generation, and a systematic evaluation across the entire pipeline, from graph constructionand knowledge retrieval to final generation.

However, existing approaches underutilize the inherent knowledge of large language models (LLMs), leading to suboptimal retrieval decisions and degraded generation performance. To bridge this gap, we propose Self-Routing RAG (SR-RAG), a novel framework that binds selective retrieval with knowledge verbalization. SR-RAG enables an LLM to dynamically decide whether to retrieve external knowledge or verbalize its own parametric knowledge. To this end, we design a multi-task objective that jointly optimizes an LLM for knowledge source selection, knowledge verbalization, and response generation. SR-RAG further incorporates a nearest neighbor search mechanism at inference time to improve the accuracy of knowledge source decisions under domain shifts. Fine-tuning three LLMs with SR-RAG significantly improves both their response accuracy and reduces the inference latency. Compared to the strongest selective retrieval baseline, SR-RAG reduces the number of retrievals by 29% while improving performance by 5.1%.</p></details> |  |

Using the Operations and Maintenance Intelligence (OMIn) dataset, we construct a QA benchmark spanning global sensemaking and actionable maintenance tasks. KEO builds a structured Knowledge Graph (KG) and integrates it into a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline, enabling more coherent, dataset-wide reasoning than traditional text-chunk RAG. We evaluate locally deployable LLMs (Gemma-3, Phi-4, Mistral-Nemo) and employ stronger models (GPT-4o, Llama-3.3) as judges. Experiments show that KEO markedly improves global sensemaking by revealing patterns and system-level insights, while text-chunk RAG remains effective for fine-grained procedural tasks requiring localized retrieval. These findings underscore the promise of KG-augmented LLMs for secure, domain-specific QA and their potential in high-stakes reasoning.</p></details> |  |

However, despite their widespread use, popular datasets such as WebQSP and CWQ suffer from critical quality issues, including inaccurate or incomplete ground-truth annotations, poorly constructed questions that are ambiguous, trivial, or unanswerable, and outdated or inconsistent knowledge. Through a manual audit of 16 popular KGQA datasets, including WebQSP and CWQ, we find that the average factual correctness rate is only 57 %. To address these issues, we introduce KGQAGen, an LLM-in-the-loop framework that systematically resolves these pitfalls. KGQAGen combines structured knowledge grounding, LLM-guided generation, and symbolic verification to produce challenging and verifiable QA instances. Using KGQAGen, we construct KGQAGen-10k, a ten-thousand scale benchmark grounded in Wikidata, and evaluate a diverse set of KG-RAG models. Experimental results demonstrate that even state-of-the-art systems struggle on this benchmark, highlighting its ability to expose limitations of existing models.

Investigating Robustness of Guardrails under RAG-style Contexts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05310v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the increasing adoption of large language models (LLMs), ensuring the safety of LLM systems has become a pressing concern. External LLM-based guardrail models have emerged as a popular solution to screen unsafe inputs and outputs, but they are themselves fine-tuned or prompt-engineered LLMs that are vulnerable to data distribution shifts. In this paper, taking Retrieval Augmentation Generation (RAG) as a case study, we investigated how robust LLM-based guardrails are against additional information embedded in the context. Through a systematic evaluation of 3 Llama Guards and 2 GPT-oss models, we confirmed that inserting benign documents into the guardrail context alters the judgments of input and output guardrails in around 11% and 8% of cases, making them unreliable. We separately analyzed the effect of each component in the augmented context: retrieved documents, user query, and LLM-generated response. The two mitigation methods we tested only bring minor improvements. These results expose a context-robustness gap in current guardrails and motivate training and evaluation protocols that are robust to retrieval and query composition.</p></details> |  |

However, the efficacy of RAG systems is fundamentally restricted by the performance of their retrieval module, since irrelevant or semantically misaligned documents directly compromise the accuracy of the final generated response. General-purpose dense retrievers can struggle with the nuanced language of specialised domains, while the high accuracy of in-domain models is often achieved at prohibitive computational costs. In this work, we aim to address this trade-off by developing and evaluating a two-stage retrieval architecture that combines a lightweight ModernBERT bidirectional encoder for efficient initial candidate retrieval with a ColBERTv2 late-interaction model for fine-grained re-ranking. We conduct comprehensive evaluations of our retriever module performance and RAG system performance in the biomedical context, fine-tuning the IR module using 10k question-passage pairs from PubMedQA. Our analysis of the retriever module confirmed the positive impact of the ColBERT re-ranker, which improved Recall@3 by up to 4.2 percentage points compared to its retrieve-only counterpart. When integrated into the biomedical RAG, our IR module leads to a state-of-the-art average accuracy of 0.4448 on the five tasks of the MIRAGE question-answering benchmark, outperforming strong baselines such as MedCPT (0.4436). Our ablation studies reveal that this performance is critically dependent on a joint fine-tuning process that aligns the retriever and re-ranker; otherwise, the re-ranker might degrade the performance.</p></details> |  |

The framework enables users to generate 3D-CG content solely through natural language instructions. 3Dify is built upon Dify, an open-source platform for AI application development, and incorporates several state-of-the-art LLM-related technologies such as the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). For 3D-CG generation support, 3Dify automates the operation of various Digital Content Creation (DCC) tools via MCP. When DCC tools do not support MCP-based interaction, the framework employs the Computer-Using Agent (CUA) method to automate Graphical User Interface (GUI) operations. Moreover, to enhance image generation quality, 3Dify allows users to provide feedback by selecting preferred images from multiple candidates. The LLM then learns variable patterns from these selections and applies them to subsequent generations. Furthermore, 3Dify supports the integration of locally deployed LLMs, enabling users to utilize custom-developed models and to reduce both time and monetary costs associated with external API calls by leveraging their own computational resources.</p></details> |  |
| **[Less LLM, More Documents: Searching for Improved RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02657v2)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) couples document retrieval with large language models (LLMs). While scaling generators improves accuracy, it also raises cost and limits deployability. We explore an orthogonal axis: enlarging the retriever's corpus to reduce reliance on large LLMs. Experimental results show that corpus scaling consistently strengthens RAG and can often serve as a substitute for increasing model size, though with diminishing returns at larger scales. Small- and mid-sized generators paired with larger corpora often rival much larger models with smaller corpora; mid-sized models tend to gain the most, while tiny and large models benefit less. Our analysis shows that improvements arise primarily from increased coverage of answer-bearing passages, while utilization efficiency remains largely unchanged. These findings establish a principled corpus-generator trade-off: investing in larger corpora offers an effective path to stronger RAG, often comparable to enlarging the LLM itself.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automating construction safety inspections using a multi-modal vision-language RAG framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04145v1)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conventional construction safety inspection methods are often inefficient as they require navigating through large volume of information. Recent advances in large vision-language models (LVLMs) provide opportunities to automate safety inspections through enhanced visual and linguistic understanding. However, existing applications face limitations including irrelevant or unspecific responses, restricted modal inputs and hallucinations. Utilisation of Large Language Models (LLMs) for this purpose is constrained by availability of training data and frequently lack real-time adaptability. This study introduces SiteShield, a multi-modal LVLM-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework for automating construction safety inspection reports by integrating visual and audio inputs. Using real-world data, SiteShield outperformed unimodal LLMs without RAG with an F1 score of 0.82, hamming loss of 0.04, precision of 0.76, and recall of 0.96. The findings indicate that SiteShield offers a novel pathway to enhance information retrieval and efficiency in generating safety reports.</p></details> | <details><summary>33 pa...</summary><p>33 pages, 11 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

In real-world scenarios, beyond pure text, a substantial amount of knowledge is stored in tables, and user questions often require retrieving answers that are distributed across multiple tables. Retrieving knowledge from a table corpora (i.e., various individual tables) for a question remains nascent, at least, for (i) how to understand intra- and inter-table knowledge effectively, (ii) how to filter unnecessary tables and how to retrieve the most relevant tables efficiently, (iii) how to prompt LLMs to infer over the retrieval, (iv) how to evaluate the corresponding performance in a realistic setting. Facing the above challenges, in this paper, we first propose a table-corpora-aware RAG framework, named T-RAG, which consists of the hierarchical memory index, multi-stage retrieval, and graph-aware prompting for effective and efficient table knowledge retrieval and inference. Further, we first develop a multi-table question answering benchmark named MultiTableQA, which spans 3 different task types, 57,193 tables, and 23,758 questions in total, and the sources are all from real-world scenarios. Based on MultiTableQA, we did the holistic comparison over table retrieval methods, RAG methods, and table-to-graph representation learning methods, where T-RAG shows the leading accuracy, recall, and running time performance. Also, under T-RAG, we evaluate the inference ability upgrade of different LLMs. Code and Data are available at https://github.com/jiaruzouu/T-RAG</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Link: https://github.com/jiaruzouu/T-RAG</p></details> |

When applying reasoning in specialized contexts with LLMs on top of a RAG, the pipeline can capture contextually relevant information, but it is not designed to retrieve comparable cases or related problems. While RAG is effective at extracting factual information, its outputs in specialized reasoning tasks often remain generic, reflecting broad facts rather than context-specific insights. In finance, it results in generic risks that are true for the majority of companies. To address this limitation, we propose a peer-aware comparative inference layer on top of RAG. Our contrastive approach outperforms baseline RAG in text generation metrics such as ROUGE and BERTScore in comparison with human-generated equity research and risk.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 1 figure, Workshop on Generative AI in Finance, NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

It adversely affects performance on downstream tasks such as question answering (QA). Existing approaches often attempt to mitigate conflicts by directly comparing two knowledge sources in a side-by-side manner, but this can overwhelm LLMs with extraneous or lengthy contexts, ultimately hindering their ability to identify and mitigate inconsistencies. To address this issue, we propose Micro-Act a framework with a hierarchical action space that automatically perceives context complexity and adaptively decomposes each knowledge source into a sequence of fine-grained comparisons. These comparisons are represented as actionable steps, enabling reasoning beyond the superficial context. Through extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets, Micro-Act consistently achieves significant increase in QA accuracy over state-of-the-art baselines across all 5 datasets and 3 conflict types, especially in temporal and semantic types where all baselines fail significantly. More importantly, Micro-Act exhibits robust performance on non-conflict questions simultaneously, highlighting its practical value in real-world RAG applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACL 2025 Main</p></details> |

In this work, we investigate a critical question: does the benefit of these complex robust training methods diminish as language models become more powerful? Through systematic evaluation across multiple model scales and question-answering datasets, our analysis reveals a consistent trend: \emph{the marginal robustness benefit of sophisticated training strategies decreases substantially as model capacity increases.} While smaller models show significant performance improvements from complex document selection and adversarial objectives, more capable models achieve comparable or even superior performance with simpler training approaches. Further investigation demonstrates that stronger models naturally exhibit better confidence calibration, cross-dataset generalization capability, and more effective attention patterns, even under simple training regimes. These findings suggest that as foundation models evolve, the engineering effort invested in complex robust training may yield diminishing returns, indicating that simplified RAG pipelines could suffice for powerful models while maintaining competitive performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at SIGIR-AP 2025</p></details> |

We present PunGPT2, the first fully open-source Punjabi generative model suite, trained on a 35GB corpus covering literature, religious texts, news, social discourse, etc. PunGPT2 captures Punjabi's syntactic and morphological richness through a tokenizer optimized for Gurmukhi and Shahmukhi scripts. We introduce Pun-RAG, a retrieval-augmented framework integrating PunGPT2 with a FAISS retriever over a curated Punjabi knowledge base, and Pun-Instruct, an instruction-tuned variant using QLoRA for robust zero-shot summarization, translation, and question answering. Our key innovation, Quantum-RAG, fuses sparse, dense, and quantum kernel embeddings for efficient, context-aware retrieval with low memory overhead, marking the first practical quantum-inspired retrieval in a low-resource LLM. Our models outperform multilingual baselines (mBERT, mT5, MuRIL, BLOOM) on FLORES-200, IndicGenBench, and a new PunjabiEval suite. Quantum-RAG yields +7.4 Recall@10 over FAISS and +3.5 BLEU over mT5 on PunjabiEval. We publicly release all training scripts, hyperparameters, evaluation pipelines, the 35GB Punjabi corpus, the PunjabiEval benchmark, and all model weights, establishing new state-of-the-art results for Punjabi language generation and retrieval.</p></details> |  |
| **[Knowledge-Graph Based RAG System Evaluation Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02549v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) has become a significant research focus and is utilized in various fields, such as text generation and dialog systems. One of the most essential applications of LLM is Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), which greatly enhances generated content's reliability and relevance. However, evaluating RAG systems remains a challenging task. Traditional evaluation metrics struggle to effectively capture the key features of modern LLM-generated content that often exhibits high fluency and naturalness. Inspired by the RAGAS tool, a well-known RAG evaluation framework, we extended this framework into a KG-based evaluation paradigm, enabling multi-hop reasoning and semantic community clustering to derive more comprehensive scoring metrics. By incorporating these comprehensive evaluation criteria, we gain a deeper understanding of RAG systems and a more nuanced perspective on their performance. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we compare its performance with RAGAS scores and construct a human-annotated subset to assess the correlation between human judgments and automated metrics. In addition, we conduct targeted experiments to demonstrate that our KG-based evaluation method is more sensitive to subtle semantic differences in generated outputs. Finally, we discuss the key challenges in evaluating RAG systems and highlight potential directions for future research.</p></details> |  |

The existing methods can be categorized into Large Vision-Language Model (LVLM)-based and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based methods. However, the former were susceptible to hallucinations, while the latter struggled for inter-modal disconnection and cross-page fragmentation. To address these challenges, a novel multi-modal RAG model, named MHier-RAG, was proposed, leveraging both textual and visual information across long-range pages to facilitate accurate question answering for visual-rich documents. A hierarchical indexing method with the integration of flattened in-page chunks and topological cross-page chunks was designed to jointly establish in-page multi-modal associations and long-distance cross-page dependencies. By means of joint similarity evaluation and large language model (LLM)-based re-ranking, a multi-granularity semantic retrieval method, including the page-level parent page retrieval and document-level summary retrieval, was proposed to foster multi-modal evidence connection and long-distance evidence integration and reasoning. Experimental results performed on public datasets, MMLongBench-Doc and LongDocURL, demonstrated the superiority of our MHier-RAG method in understanding and answering modality-rich and multi-page documents.</p></details> | <details><summary>Comme...</summary><p>Comments: Update Title, Author, Abstract, etc</p></details> |

However, these systems remain prone to hallucinations due to limited factual grounding. While text-based dialogue systems address this challenge by integrating tools such as web search and knowledge graph APIs, we introduce the first approach to extend tool use directly into speech-in speech-out systems. A key challenge is that tool integration substantially increases response latency, disrupting conversational flow. To mitigate this, we propose Streaming Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Streaming RAG), a novel framework that reduces user-perceived latency by predicting tool queries in parallel with user speech, even before the user finishes speaking. Specifically, we develop a post-training pipeline that teaches the model when to issue tool calls during ongoing speech and how to generate spoken summaries that fuse audio queries with retrieved text results, thereby improving both accuracy and responsiveness. To evaluate our approach, we construct AudioCRAG, a benchmark created by converting queries from the publicly available CRAG dataset into speech form. Experimental results demonstrate that our streaming RAG approach increases QA accuracy by up to 200% relative (from 11.1% to 34.2% absolute) and further enhances user experience by reducing tool use latency by 20%. Importantly, our streaming RAG approach is modality-agnostic and can be applied equally to typed input, paving the way for more agentic, real-time AI assistants.</p></details> |  |

Current biomedical question-answering systems primarily focus on short-form answers, failing to provide the comprehensive explanations necessary for clinical decision-making. We present RAG-BioQA, a novel framework combining retrieval-augmented generation with domain-specific fine-tuning to produce evidence-based, long-form biomedical answers. Our approach integrates BioBERT embeddings with FAISS indexing and compares various re-ranking strategies (BM25, ColBERT, MonoT5) to optimize context selection before synthesizing evidence through a fine-tuned T5 model. Experimental results on the PubMedQA dataset show significant improvements over baselines, with our best model achieving substantial gains across BLEU, ROUGE, and METEOR metrics, advancing the state of accessible, evidence-based biomedical knowledge retrieval.</p></details> |  |

While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) can improve performance by providing runtime guidance, it requires maintaining external knowledge databases and adds computational overhead at every deployment. We propose a simple pipeline that converts inference-time retrieval into learned competence through distillation. Our approach: (1) extracts compact, reusable hints from agent failures, (2) uses these hints to generate improved teacher trajectories via one-shot retrieval at episode start, and (3) trains student models on these trajectories with hint strings removed, forcing internalization rather than memorization. Across two interactive benchmarks, ALFWorld (household tasks) and WebShop (online shopping), distilled students consistently outperform baseline agents, achieving up to 91% success on ALFWorld (vs. 79% for baselines) and improving WebShop scores to 72 (vs. 61 for baselines), while using 10-60% fewer tokens than retrieval-augmented teachers depending on the environment. The approach generalizes across model scales (7B/14B parameters) and agent architectures (ReAct/StateAct), demonstrating that retrieval benefits can be effectively internalized through targeted fine-tuning without permanent runtime dependencies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review at ICLR 2026</p></details> |

Large-scale analysis, however, has been constrained by the need for manual annotation due to the context-sensitive nature of metaphor. This study investigates the potential of large language models (LLMs) to automate metaphor identification in full texts. We compare three methods: (i) retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), where the model is provided with a codebook and instructed to annotate texts based on its rules and examples; (ii) prompt engineering, where we design task-specific verbal instructions; and (iii) fine-tuning, where the model is trained on hand-coded texts to optimize performance. Within prompt engineering, we test zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought strategies. Our results show that state-of-the-art closed-source LLMs can achieve high accuracy, with fine-tuning yielding a median F1 score of 0.79. A comparison of human and LLM outputs reveals that most discrepancies are systematic, reflecting well-known grey areas and conceptual challenges in metaphor theory. We propose that LLMs can be used to at least partly automate metaphor identification and can serve as a testbed for developing and refining metaphor identification protocols and the theory that underpins them.</p></details> |  |

We introduce Eyes-on-Me, a modular attack that decomposes an adversarial document into reusable Attention Attractors and Focus Regions. Attractors are optimized to direct attention to the Focus Region. Attackers can then insert semantic baits for the retriever or malicious instructions for the generator, adapting to new targets at near zero cost. This is achieved by steering a small subset of attention heads that we empirically identify as strongly correlated with attack success. Across 18 end-to-end RAG settings (3 datasets $\times$ 2 retrievers $\times$ 3 generators), Eyes-on-Me raises average attack success rates from 21.9 to 57.8 (+35.9 points, 2.6$\times$ over prior work). A single optimized attractor transfers to unseen black box retrievers and generators without retraining. Our findings establish a scalable paradigm for RAG data poisoning and show that modular, reusable components pose a practical threat to modern AI systems. They also reveal a strong link between attention concentration and model outputs, informing interpretability research.</p></details> |  |

Building on Gienapp's utility-dimension framework, we designed a human-centred questionnaire that assesses RAG outputs across 12 dimensions. We iteratively refined the questionnaire through several rounds of ratings on a set of query-output pairs and semantic discussions. Ultimately, we incorporated feedback from both a human rater and a human-LLM pair. Results indicate that while large language models (LLMs) reliably focus on metric descriptions and scale labels, they exhibit weaknesses in detecting textual format variations. Humans struggled to focus strictly on metric descriptions and labels. LLM ratings and explanations were viewed as a helpful support, but numeric LLM and human ratings lacked agreement. The final questionnaire extends the initial framework by focusing on user intent, text structuring, and information verifiability.</p></details> |  |

However, existing extraction methods typically rely on malicious inputs such as prompt injection or jailbreaking, making them easily detectable via input- or output-level detection. In this paper, we introduce Implicit Knowledge Extraction Attack (IKEA), which conducts Knowledge Extraction on RAG systems through benign queries. Specifically, IKEA first leverages anchor concepts-keywords related to internal knowledge-to generate queries with a natural appearance, and then designs two mechanisms that lead anchor concepts to thoroughly "explore" the RAG's knowledge: (1) Experience Reflection Sampling, which samples anchor concepts based on past query-response histories, ensuring their relevance to the topic; (2) Trust Region Directed Mutation, which iteratively mutates anchor concepts under similarity constraints to further exploit the embedding space. Extensive experiments demonstrate IKEA's effectiveness under various defenses, surpassing baselines by over 80% in extraction efficiency and 90% in attack success rate. Moreover, the substitute RAG system built from IKEA's extractions shows comparable performance to the original RAG and outperforms those based on baselines across multiple evaluation tasks, underscoring the stealthy copyright infringement risk in RAG systems.</p></details> |  |

We propose Knowledgeable-R1, a reinforcement-learning framework that explicitly trains large language models to use parametric knowledge (PK) to resist contextual interference while still exploiting external context when it is reliably helpful. Knowledgeable-R1 introduces a joint sampling scheme that generates paired responses with and without retrieval, and learns both local advantages (within each decoding regime) and global advantages under the same input to quantify when to ignore misleading context versus adopt it. We employ an asymmetric advantage transformation that amplifies exploratory behaviors toward parametric knowledge. Experiments show that \method significantly improves robustness and reasoning accuracy in knowledge conflict scenarios and general RAG scenarios, outperforming SOTA baselines by 23% in counterfactual scenarios, and without degradation when the retrieved context is fully accurate.Our code are available at https://github.com/lcy80366872/knowledgeable-R1.</p></details> |  |

They can help generate long-form answers for scientific questions, which are crucial for comprehensive understanding of complex phenomena that require detailed explanations spanning multiple interconnected concepts and evidence. However, LLMs often suffer from hallucination, especially in the challenging task of long-form scientific question answering. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approaches can ground LLMs by incorporating external knowledge sources to improve trustworthiness. In this context, scientific simulators, which play a vital role in validating hypotheses, offer a particularly promising retrieval source to mitigate hallucination and enhance answer factuality. However, existing RAG approaches cannot be directly applied for scientific simulation-based retrieval due to two fundamental challenges: how to retrieve from scientific simulators, and how to efficiently verify and update long-form answers. To overcome these challenges, we propose the simulator-based RAG framework (SimulRAG) and provide a long-form scientific QA benchmark covering climate science and epidemiology with ground truth verified by both simulations and human annotators. In this framework, we propose a generalized simulator retrieval interface to transform between textual and numerical modalities. We further design a claim-level generation method that utilizes uncertainty estimation scores and simulator boundary assessment (UE+SBA) to efficiently verify and update claims. Extensive experiments demonstrate SimulRAG outperforms traditional RAG baselines by 30.4% in informativeness and 16.3% in factuality. UE+SBA further improves efficiency and quality for claim-level generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Haozh...</summary><p>Haozhou Xu and Dongxia Wu are co-first authors</p></details> |

The proposed approach overcomes limitations of existing methods by enabling fine-grained control over item difficulty, psychometric calibration, and cognitive alignment. It employs multi-graph isolation to preserve domain-specific semantics and leverages a distributed agent architecture coordinated through Data Distribution Service, abbreviated as DDS, for scalable and fault-tolerant operations. Each agent specializes in tasks such as retrieval, generation, or evaluation, forming a modular and traceable pipeline. Distinctively, the framework encodes semantic hierarchies, PageRank-based concept weighting, and assessment-theory parameters directly into the generation process, ensuring that questions are both contextually grounded and cognitively calibrated. Deployed at Taiwan's National Institute of Environmental Research, the system has demonstrated practical value by reducing manual workload, improving reliability and validity, and supporting both adaptive and standardized assessments. By integrating psychometric theory with AI-driven retrieval and generation, this work establishes a scalable and cognitively aligned solution for education and professional certification.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures and 6 tables</p></details> |

However, the performance of MLLMs for knowledge-intensive visual questions, which require external knowledge beyond the visual content of an image, still remains limited. While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a promising solution to provide models with external knowledge, its conventional single-pass framework often fails to gather sufficient knowledge. To overcome this limitation, we propose MI-RAG, a Multimodal Iterative RAG framework that leverages reasoning to enhance retrieval and incorporates knowledge synthesis to refine its understanding. At each iteration, the model formulates a reasoning-guided multi-query to explore multiple facets of knowledge. Subsequently, these queries drive a joint search across heterogeneous knowledge bases, retrieving diverse knowledge. This retrieved knowledge is then synthesized to enrich the reasoning record, progressively deepening the model's understanding. Experiments on challenging benchmarks, including Encyclopedic VQA, InfoSeek, and OK-VQA, show that MI-RAG significantly improves both retrieval recall and answer accuracy, establishing a scalable approach for compositional reasoning in knowledge-intensive VQA.</p></details> |  |

Existing RAG solutions do not focus on queries that may require fetching multiple documents with substantially different contents. Such queries occur frequently, but are challenging because the embeddings of these documents may be distant in the embedding space, making it hard to retrieve them all. This paper introduces Multi-Head RAG (MRAG), a novel scheme designed to address this gap with a simple yet powerful idea: leveraging activations of Transformer's multi-head attention layer, instead of the decoder layer, as keys for fetching multi-aspect documents. The driving observation is that different attention heads learn to capture different data aspects. Harnessing the corresponding activations results in embeddings that represent various facets of data items and queries, improving the retrieval accuracy for complex queries. We provide an evaluation methodology and metrics, multi-aspect datasets, and real-world use cases to demonstrate MRAG's effectiveness. We show MRAG's design advantages over 18 RAG baselines, empirical improvements of up to 20% in retrieval success ratios, and benefits for downstream LLM generation. MRAG can be seamlessly integrated with existing RAG frameworks and benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

The evaluator reports decision accuracy, trace quality (completeness, correctness, order), retrieval effectiveness, SQL correctness via result-set equivalence, policy coverage, latency, and an explanation-hallucination rate. A normalized Scenario Difficulty Index (SDI) and a budgeted variant (SDI-R) aggregate results while accounting for retrieval difficulty and time.

These systems, however, remain vulnerable to attacks on the retrieval corpus, such as prompt injection. RAG-based search systems (e.g., Google's Search AI Overview) present an interesting setting for studying and protecting against such threats, as defense algorithms can benefit from built-in reliability signals -- like document ranking -- and represent a non-LLM challenge for the adversary due to decades of work to thwart SEO. Motivated by, but not limited to, this scenario, this work introduces ReliabilityRAG, a framework for adversarial robustness that explicitly leverages reliability information of retrieved documents. Our first contribution adopts a graph-theoretic perspective to identify a "consistent majority" among retrieved documents to filter out malicious ones. We introduce a novel algorithm based on finding a Maximum Independent Set (MIS) on a document graph where edges encode contradiction. Our MIS variant explicitly prioritizes higher-reliability documents and provides provable robustness guarantees against bounded adversarial corruption under natural assumptions. Recognizing the computational cost of exact MIS for large retrieval sets, our second contribution is a scalable weighted sample and aggregate framework. It explicitly utilizes reliability information, preserving some robustness guarantees while efficiently handling many documents. We present empirical results showing ReliabilityRAG provides superior robustness against adversarial attacks compared to prior methods, maintains high benign accuracy, and excels in long-form generation tasks where prior robustness-focused methods struggled. Our work is a significant step towards more effective, provably robust defenses against retrieved corpus corruption in RAG.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Cross-modal RAG: Sub-dimensional Text-to-Image Retrieval-Augmented Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21956v3)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image generation increasingly demands access to domain-specific, fine-grained, and rapidly evolving knowledge that pretrained models cannot fully capture, necessitating the integration of retrieval methods. Existing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods attempt to address this by retrieving globally relevant images, but they fail when no single image contains all desired elements from a complex user query. We propose Cross-modal RAG, a novel framework that decomposes both queries and images into sub-dimensional components, enabling subquery-aware retrieval and generation. Our method introduces a hybrid retrieval strategy - combining a sub-dimensional sparse retriever with a dense retriever - to identify a Pareto-optimal set of images, each contributing complementary aspects of the query. During generation, a multimodal large language model is guided to selectively condition on relevant visual features aligned to specific subqueries, ensuring subquery-aware image synthesis. Extensive experiments on MS-COCO, Flickr30K, WikiArt, CUB, and ImageNet-LT demonstrate that Cross-modal RAG significantly outperforms existing baselines in the retrieval and further contributes to generation quality, while maintaining high efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Your RAG is Unfair: Exposing Fairness Vulnerabilities in Retrieval-Augmented Generation via Backdoor Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22486v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances factual grounding by integrating retrieval mechanisms with generative models but introduces new attack surfaces, particularly through backdoor attacks. While prior research has largely focused on disinformation threats, fairness vulnerabilities remain underexplored. Unlike conventional backdoors that rely on direct trigger-to-target mappings, fairness-driven attacks exploit the interaction between retrieval and generation models, manipulating semantic relationships between target groups and social biases to establish a persistent and covert influence on content generation. This paper introduces BiasRAG, a systematic framework that exposes fairness vulnerabilities in RAG through a two-phase backdoor attack. During the pre-training phase, the query encoder is compromised to align the target group with the intended social bias, ensuring long-term persistence. In the post-deployment phase, adversarial documents are injected into knowledge bases to reinforce the backdoor, subtly influencing retrieved content while remaining undetectable under standard fairness evaluations. Together, BiasRAG ensures precise target alignment over sensitive attributes, stealthy execution, and resilience. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that BiasRAG achieves high attack success rates while preserving contextual relevance and utility, establishing a persistent and evolving threat to fairness in RAG.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP 2025</p></details> |
| **[Zero-Effort Image-to-Music Generation: An Interpretable RAG-based VLM Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22378v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Image-to-Music (I2M) generation has garnered significant attention, with potential applications in fields such as gaming, advertising, and multi-modal art creation. However, due to the ambiguous and subjective nature of I2M tasks, most end-to-end methods lack interpretability, leaving users puzzled about the generation results. Even methods based on emotion mapping face controversy, as emotion represents only a singular aspect of art. Additionally, most learning-based methods require substantial computational resources and large datasets for training, hindering accessibility for common users. To address these challenges, we propose the first Vision Language Model (VLM)-based I2M framework that offers high interpretability and low computational cost. Specifically, we utilize ABC notation to bridge the text and music modalities, enabling the VLM to generate music using natural language. We then apply multi-modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and self-refinement techniques to allow the VLM to produce high-quality music without external training. Furthermore, we leverage the generated motivations in text and the attention maps from the VLM to provide explanations for the generated results in both text and image modalities. To validate our method, we conduct both human studies and machine evaluations, where our method outperforms others in terms of music quality and music-image consistency, indicating promising results. Our code is available at https://github.com/RS2002/Image2Music .</p></details> |  |
| **[Comparing RAG and GraphRAG for Page-Level Retrieval Question Answering on Math Textbook](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16780v2)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Technology-enhanced learning environments often help students retrieve relevant learning content for questions arising during self-paced study. Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as novel aids for information retrieval during learning. While LLMs are effective for general-purpose question-answering, they typically lack alignment with the domain knowledge of specific course materials such as textbooks and slides. We investigate Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and GraphRAG, a knowledge graph-enhanced RAG approach, for page-level question answering in an undergraduate mathematics textbook. While RAG has been effective for retrieving discrete, contextually relevant passages, GraphRAG may excel in modeling interconnected concepts and hierarchical knowledge structures. We curate a dataset of 477 question-answer pairs, each tied to a distinct textbook page. We then compare the standard embedding-based RAG methods to GraphRAG for evaluating both retrieval accuracy-whether the correct page is retrieved-and generated answer quality via F1 scores. Our findings show that embedding-based RAG achieves higher retrieval accuracy and better F1 scores compared to GraphRAG, which tends to retrieve excessive and sometimes irrelevant content due to its entity-based structure. We also explored re-ranking the retrieved pages with LLM and observed mixed results, including performance drop and hallucinations when dealing with larger context windows. Overall, this study highlights both the promises and challenges of page-level retrieval systems in educational contexts, emphasizing the need for more refined retrieval methods to build reliable AI tutoring solutions in providing reference page numbers.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond RAG vs. Long-Context: Learning Distraction-Aware Retrieval for Efficient Knowledge Grounding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21865v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a framework for grounding Large Language Models (LLMs) in external, up-to-date information. However, recent advancements in context window size allow LLMs to process inputs of up to 128K tokens or more, offering an alternative strategy: supplying the full document context directly to the model, rather than relying on RAG to retrieve a subset of contexts. Nevertheless, this emerging alternative strategy has notable limitations: (i) it is token-inefficient to handle large and potentially redundant contexts; (ii) it exacerbates the `lost in the middle' phenomenon; and (iii) under limited model capacity, it amplifies distraction, ultimately degrading LLM output quality. In this paper, we propose LDAR (Learning Distraction-Aware Retrieval), an adaptive retriever that learns to retrieve contexts in a way that mitigates interference from distracting passages, thereby achieving significantly higher performance with reduced token usage compared to long-context approaches. Extensive experiments across diverse LLM architectures and six knowledge-intensive benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach, highlighting the importance of balancing the trade-off between information coverage and distraction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Online-Optimized RAG for Tool Use and Function Calling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20415v2)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In many applications, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) drives tool use and function calling by embedding the (user) queries and matching them to pre-specified tool/function descriptions. In this paper, we address an embedding misalignment issue that often arises in practical applications due to imperfect embedding models or noisy descriptions; such misalignment may lead to incorrect retrieval and task failure. We introduce Online-Optimized RAG, a deployment-time framework that continually adapts retrieval embeddings from live interactions using minimal feedback (e.g., task success). Online-Optimized RAG applies lightweight online gradient updates with negligible per-query latency and requires no changes to the underlying LLM. The method is plug-and-play: it supports both single- and multi-hop tool use, dynamic tool inventories, and $K$-retrieval with re-ranking. We provide a problem-dependent theoretical analysis that quantifies how the method's performance depends on the initialization quality of the embeddings and other related quantities. Across diverse tool-use and document-retrieval scenarios, our Online-Optimized RAG consistently improves tool selection accuracy and end-task success, thus providing a simple, practical path to robust, self-improving RAG systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Provenance Analysis of Archaeological Artifacts via Multimodal RAG Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20769v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we present a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-based system for provenance analysis of archaeological artifacts, designed to support expert reasoning by integrating multimodal retrieval and large vision-language models (VLMs). The system constructs a dual-modal knowledge base from reference texts and images, enabling raw visual, edge-enhanced, and semantic retrieval to identify stylistically similar objects. Retrieved candidates are synthesized by the VLM to generate structured inferences, including chronological, geographical, and cultural attributions, alongside interpretive justifications. We evaluate the system on a set of Eastern Eurasian Bronze Age artifacts from the British Museum. Expert evaluation demonstrates that the system produces meaningful and interpretable outputs, offering scholars concrete starting points for analysis and significantly alleviating the cognitive burden of navigating vast comparative corpora.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causal-Counterfactual RAG: The Integration of Causal-Counterfactual Reasoning into RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14435v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have transformed natural language processing (NLP), enabling diverse applications by integrating large-scale pre-trained knowledge. However, their static knowledge limits dynamic reasoning over external information, especially in knowledge-intensive domains. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this challenge by combining retrieval mechanisms with generative modeling to improve contextual understanding. Traditional RAG systems suffer from disrupted contextual integrity due to text chunking and over-reliance on semantic similarity for retrieval, often resulting in shallow and less accurate responses. We propose Causal-Counterfactual RAG, a novel framework that integrates explicit causal graphs representing cause-effect relationships into the retrieval process and incorporates counterfactual reasoning grounded on the causal structure. Unlike conventional methods, our framework evaluates not only direct causal evidence but also the counterfactuality of associated causes, combining results from both to generate more robust, accurate, and interpretable answers. By leveraging causal pathways and associated hypothetical scenarios, Causal-Counterfactual RAG preserves contextual coherence, reduces hallucination, and enhances reasoning fidelity.</p></details> |  |
| **[RAG Security and Privacy: Formalizing the Threat Model and Attack Surface](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20324v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an emerging approach in natural language processing that combines large language models (LLMs) with external document retrieval to produce more accurate and grounded responses. While RAG has shown strong potential in reducing hallucinations and improving factual consistency, it also introduces new privacy and security challenges that differ from those faced by traditional LLMs. Existing research has demonstrated that LLMs can leak sensitive information through training data memorization or adversarial prompts, and RAG systems inherit many of these vulnerabilities. At the same time, reliance of RAG on an external knowledge base opens new attack surfaces, including the potential for leaking information about the presence or content of retrieved documents, or for injecting malicious content to manipulate model behavior. Despite these risks, there is currently no formal framework that defines the threat landscape for RAG systems. In this paper, we address a critical gap in the literature by proposing, to the best of our knowledge, the first formal threat model for retrieval-RAG systems. We introduce a structured taxonomy of adversary types based on their access to model components and data, and we formally define key threat vectors such as document-level membership inference and data poisoning, which pose serious privacy and integrity risks in real-world deployments. By establishing formal definitions and attack models, our work lays the foundation for a more rigorous and principled understanding of privacy and security in RAG systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 5th ICDM Workshop on September 20, 2025</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing RAG Efficiency with Adaptive Context Compression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22931v3)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge but incurs significant inference costs due to lengthy retrieved contexts. While context compression mitigates this issue, existing methods apply fixed compression rates, over-compressing simple queries or under-compressing complex ones. We propose Adaptive Context Compression for RAG (ACC-RAG), a framework that dynamically adjusts compression rates based on input complexity, optimizing inference efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. ACC-RAG combines a hierarchical compressor (for multi-granular embeddings) with a context selector to retain minimal sufficient information, akin to human skimming. Evaluated on Wikipedia and five QA datasets, ACC-RAG outperforms fixed-rate methods and matches/unlocks over 4 times faster inference versus standard RAG while maintaining or improving accuracy.</p></details> |  |

However, there is a lack of empirical studies that report on the development of RAG-based implementations grounded in real-world use cases, evaluated through general user involvement, and accompanied by systematic documentation of lessons learned. This paper presents five domain-specific RAG applications developed for real-world scenarios across governance, cybersecurity, agriculture, industrial research, and medical diagnostics. Each system incorporates multilingual OCR, semantic retrieval via vector embeddings, and domain-adapted LLMs, deployed through local servers or cloud APIs to meet distinct user needs. A web-based evaluation involving a total of 100 participants assessed the systems across six dimensions: (i) Ease of Use, (ii) Relevance, (iii) Transparency, (iv) Responsiveness, (v) Accuracy, and (vi) Likelihood of Recommendation. Based on user feedback and our development experience, we documented twelve key lessons learned, highlighting technical, operational, and ethical challenges affecting the reliability and usability of RAG systems in practice.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the Proceedings of the 51st Euromicro Conference on Software Engineering and Advanced Applications, SEAA 2025.

To comprehensively evaluate the resilience of current RAG methods, we introduce HawkBench, a human-labeled, multi-domain benchmark designed to rigorously assess RAG performance across categorized task types. By stratifying tasks based on information-seeking behaviors, HawkBench provides a systematic evaluation of how well RAG systems adapt to diverse user needs. Unlike existing benchmarks, which focus primarily on specific task types (mostly factoid queries) and rely on varying knowledge bases, HawkBench offers: (1) systematic task stratification to cover a broad range of query types, including both factoid and rationale queries, (2) integration of multi-domain corpora across all task types to mitigate corpus bias, and (3) rigorous annotation for high-quality evaluation. HawkBench includes 1,600 high-quality test samples, evenly distributed across domains and task types. Using this benchmark, we evaluate representative RAG methods, analyzing their performance in terms of answer quality and response latency. Our findings highlight the need for dynamic task strategies that integrate decision-making, query interpretation, and global knowledge understanding to improve RAG generalizability. We believe HawkBench serves as a pivotal benchmark for advancing the resilience of RAG methods and their ability to achieve general-purpose information seeking.</p></details> | <details><summary>Neuri...</summary><p>Neurips 25 DB Track, Spotlight</p></details> |

This paper introduces ReproRAG, a comprehensive benchmarking framework designed to systematically measure and quantify the reproducibility of vector-based retrieval systems. ReproRAG investigates sources of uncertainty across the entire pipeline, including different embedding models, precision, retrieval algorithms, hardware configurations, and distributed execution environments. Utilizing a suite of metrics, such as Exact Match Rate, Jaccard Similarity, and Kendall's Tau, the proposed framework effectively characterizes the trade-offs between reproducibility and performance. Our large-scale empirical study reveals critical insights; for instance, we observe that different embedding models have remarkable impact on RAG reproducibility. The open-sourced ReproRAG framework provides researchers and engineers productive tools to validate deployments, benchmark reproducibility, and make informed design decisions, thereby fostering more trustworthy AI for science.</p></details> |  |

Researchers have explored methods for automatically generating counterspeech to health misinformation as a mitigation strategy. Existing approaches often produce uniform responses, ignoring that the health literacy level of the audience could affect the accessibility and effectiveness of counterspeech. We propose a Controlled-Literacy framework using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with reinforcement learning (RL) to generate tailored counterspeech adapted to different health literacy levels. In particular, we retrieve knowledge aligned with specific health literacy levels, enabling accessible and factual information to support generation. We design a reward function incorporating subjective user preferences and objective readability-based rewards to optimize counterspeech to the target health literacy level. Experiment results show that Controlled-Literacy outperforms baselines by generating more accessible and user-preferred counterspeech. This research contributes to more equitable and impactful public health communication by improving the accessibility and comprehension of counterspeech to health misinformation</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Findings of EMNLP 2025</p></details> |

While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems attempt to address this issue by grounding responses in external knowledge, hallucination remains a persistent challenge, particularly for morphologically complex, low-resource languages like Turkish. This paper introduces Turk-LettuceDetect, the first suite of hallucination detection models specifically designed for Turkish RAG applications. Building on the LettuceDetect framework, we formulate hallucination detection as a token-level classification task and fine-tune three distinct encoder architectures: a Turkish-specific ModernBERT, TurkEmbed4STS, and multilingual EuroBERT. These models were trained on a machine-translated version of the RAGTruth benchmark dataset containing 17,790 instances across question answering, data-to-text generation, and summarization tasks. Our experimental results show that the ModernBERT-based model achieves an F1-score of 0.7266 on the complete test set, with particularly strong performance on structured tasks. The models maintain computational efficiency while supporting long contexts up to 8,192 tokens, making them suitable for real-time deployment. Comparative analysis reveals that while state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate high recall, they suffer from low precision due to over-generation of hallucinated content, underscoring the necessity of specialized detection mechanisms. By releasing our models and translated dataset, this work addresses a critical gap in multilingual NLP and establishes a foundation for developing more reliable and trustworthy AI applications for Turkish and other languages.</p></details> |  |

However, these systems are increasingly vulnerable to prompt injection attacks, where adversaries manipulate inputs to elicit unintended behaviors such as leaking sensitive information or generating harmful content. This paper presents a case study on the design and implementation of a secure retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) chatbot for Hsinchu smart tourism services. The system integrates RAG with API function calls, multi-layered linguistic analysis, and guardrails against injections, achieving high contextual awareness and security. Key features include a tiered response strategy, RAG-driven knowledge grounding, and intent decomposition across lexical, semantic, and pragmatic levels. Defense mechanisms include system norms, gatekeepers for intent judgment, and reverse RAG text to prioritize verified data. We also benchmark a GPT-5 variant (released 2025-08-07) to assess inherent robustness. Evaluations with 674 adversarial prompts and 223 benign queries show over 95% accuracy on benign tasks and substantial detection of injection attacks. GPT-5 blocked about 85% of attacks, showing progress yet highlighting the need for layered defenses. Findings emphasize contributions to sustainable tourism, multilingual accessibility, and ethical AI deployment. This work offers a practical framework for deploying secure chatbots in smart tourism and contributes to resilient, trustworthy AI applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 7 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[UR$^2$: Unify RAG and Reasoning through Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06165v3)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities through two complementary paradigms: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which enhances knowledge grounding, and Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), which optimizes complex reasoning abilities. However, these two capabilities are often developed in isolation, and existing efforts to unify them remain narrow in scope -- typically limited to open-domain QA with fixed retrieval settings and task-specific constraints. This lack of integration constrains generalization and limits the applicability of RAG-RL methods to broader domains. To bridge this gap, we propose UR2 (Unified RAG and Reasoning), a general framework that unifies retrieval and reasoning through reinforcement learning. UR2 introduces two key contributions: a difficulty-aware curriculum training that selectively invokes retrieval only for challenging problems, and a hybrid knowledge access strategy combining domain-specific offline corpora with LLM-generated summaries. These components are designed to enable dynamic coordination between retrieval and reasoning, improving adaptability across a diverse range of tasks. Experiments across open-domain QA, MMLU-Pro, medical, and mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrate that UR$^2$ (built on Qwen-2.5-3/7B and LLaMA-3.1-8B) significantly outperforms existing RAG and RL methods, achieving comparable performance to GPT-4o-mini and GPT-4.1-mini on several benchmarks.

Yet, a pressing challenge remains: How can we trust these agents especially in zero-shot settings with no fine-tuning? We introduce a novel modular Agentic AI visual classification framework that integrates generalist multimodal agents with a non-visual reasoning orchestrator and a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) module. Applied to apple leaf disease diagnosis, we benchmark three configurations: (I) zero-shot with confidence-based orchestration, (II) fine-tuned agents with improved performance, and (III) trust-calibrated orchestration enhanced by CLIP-based image retrieval and re-evaluation loops. Using confidence calibration metrics (ECE, OCR, CCC), the orchestrator modulates trust across agents. Our results demonstrate a 77.94\% accuracy improvement in the zero-shot setting using trust-aware orchestration and RAG, achieving 85.63\% overall. GPT-4o showed better calibration, while Qwen-2.5-VL displayed overconfidence. Furthermore, image-RAG grounded predictions with visually similar cases, enabling correction of agent overconfidence via iterative re-evaluation. The proposed system separates perception (vision agents) from meta-reasoning (orchestrator), enabling scalable and interpretable multi-agent AI. This blueprint illustrates how Agentic AI can deliver trustworthy, modular, and transparent reasoning, and is extensible to diagnostics, biology, and other trust-critical domains. In doing so, we highlight Agentic AI not just as an architecture but as a paradigm for building reliable multi-agent intelligence. agentic ai, orchestrator agent trust, trust orchestration, visual classification, retrieval augmented reasoning</p></details> |  |

Traditional retrieval systems rely on a single database and retriever, but financial applications require more sophisticated approaches to handle intricate regulatory filings, market analyses, and extensive multi-year reports. We introduce a framework for financial Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) that leverages agentic AI and the Multi-HyDE system, an approach that generates multiple, nonequivalent queries to boost the effectiveness and coverage of retrieval from large, structured financial corpora. Our pipeline is optimized for token efficiency and multi-step financial reasoning, and we demonstrate that their combination improves accuracy by 11.2% and reduces hallucinations by 15%. Our method is evaluated on standard financial QA benchmarks, showing that integrating domain-specific retrieval mechanisms such as Multi-HyDE with robust toolsets, including keyword and table-based retrieval, significantly enhances both the accuracy and reliability of answers. This research not only delivers a modular, adaptable retrieval framework for finance but also highlights the importance of structured agent workflows and multi-perspective retrieval for trustworthy deployment of AI in high-stakes financial applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 Pa...</summary><p>14 Pages, 8 Tables, 2 Figures.

| **[SIRAG: Towards Stable and Interpretable RAG with A Process-Supervised Multi-Agent Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18167v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enables large language models (LLMs) to access external knowledge sources, but the effectiveness of RAG relies on the coordination between the retriever and the generator. Since these components are developed independently, their interaction is often suboptimal: the retriever may return irrelevant or redundant documents, while the generator may fail to fully leverage retrieved evidence. In this work, we propose a process-supervised multi-agent framework to bridge the gap between retriever and generator. The framework introduces two lightweight agents: a Decision Maker, which determines when to continue retrieval or stop for answer generation, and a Knowledge Selector, which filters retrieved documents to retain only the most useful evidence. To provide fine-grained supervision, we employ an LLM-as-a-Judge that evaluates each intermediate action with process-level rewards, ensuring more accurate credit assignment than relying solely on final answer correctness. We further adopt a tree-structured rollout strategy to explore diverse reasoning paths, and train both agents with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) in an end-to-end manner. Experiments on single-hop and multi-hop question answering benchmarks show that our approach achieves higher accuracy, more stable convergence, and produces more interpretable reasoning trajectories compared with standard RAG baselines. Importantly, the proposed framework is modular and plug-and-play, requiring no modification to the retriever or generator, making it practical for real-world RAG applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages,2 figures, IRAC under review</p></details> |

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this limitation by incorporating external information, often from graph-structured data. However, existing graph-based RAG methods suffer from poor graph quality due to incomplete extraction and insufficient utilization of query information during retrieval. To overcome these limitations, we propose Clue-RAG, a novel approach that introduces (1) a multi-partite graph index incorporates Chunk, knowledge unit, and entity to capture semantic content at multiple levels of granularity, coupled with a hybrid extraction strategy that reduces LLM token usage while still producing accurate and disambiguated knowledge units, and (2) Q-Iter, a query-driven iterative retrieval strategy that enhances relevance through semantic search and constrained graph traversal. Experiments on three QA benchmarks show that Clue-RAG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to 99.33% higher Accuracy and 113.51% higher F1 score while reducing indexing costs by 72.58%. Remarkably, Clue-RAG matches or outperforms baselines even without using an LLM for indexing. These results demonstrate the effectiveness and cost-efficiency of Clue-RAG in advancing graph-based RAG systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[RAGs to Riches: RAG-like Few-shot Learning for Large Language Model Role-playing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12168v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Role-playing Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-stakes domains such as healthcare, education, and governance, where failures can directly impact user trust and well-being. A cost effective paradigm for LLM role-playing is few-shot learning, but existing approaches often cause models to break character in unexpected and potentially harmful ways, especially when interacting with hostile users. Inspired by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), we reformulate LLM role-playing into a text retrieval problem and propose a new prompting framework called RAGs-to-Riches, which leverages curated reference demonstrations to condition LLM responses. We evaluate our framework with LLM-as-a-judge preference voting and introduce two novel token-level ROUGE metrics: Intersection over Output (IOO) to quantity how much an LLM improvises and Intersection over References (IOR) to measure few-shot demonstrations utilization rate during the evaluation tasks. When simulating interactions with a hostile user, our prompting strategy incorporates in its responses during inference an average of 35% more tokens from the reference demonstrations. As a result, across 453 role-playing interactions, our models are consistently judged as being more authentic, and remain in-character more often than zero-shot and in-context Learning (ICL) methods. Our method presents a scalable strategy for building robust, human-aligned LLM role-playing frameworks.</p></details> |  |

While autonomous agents show promise, they often struggle with domain-specific nuances, intent alignment, and enterprise integration. We present Enterprise Deep Research (EDR), a multi-agent system that integrates (1) a Master Planning Agent for adaptive query decomposition, (2) four specialized search agents (General, Academic, GitHub, LinkedIn), (3) an extensible MCP-based tool ecosystem supporting NL2SQL, file analysis, and enterprise workflows, (4) a Visualization Agent for data-driven insights, and (5) a reflection mechanism that detects knowledge gaps and updates research direction with optional human-in-the-loop steering guidance. These components enable automated report generation, real-time streaming, and seamless enterprise deployment, as validated on internal datasets. On open-ended benchmarks including DeepResearch Bench and DeepConsult, EDR outperforms state-of-the-art agentic systems without any human steering. We release the EDR framework and benchmark trajectories to advance research on multi-agent reasoning applications.

While other agents leverage rich programmatic interfaces (APIs, MCP servers, tools), computer-use agents (CUAs) remain isolated from these capabilities. We present UltraCUA, a foundation model that bridges this gap through hybrid action -- seamlessly integrating GUI primitives with high-level programmatic tool calls. To achieve this, our approach comprises four key components: (1) an automated pipeline that scales programmatic tools from software documentation, open-source repositories, and code generation; (2) a synthetic data engine producing over 17,000 verifiable tasks spanning real-world computer-use scenarios; (3) a large-scale high-quality hybrid action trajectory collection with both low-level GUI actions and high-level programmatic tool calls; and (4) a two-stage training pipeline combining supervised fine-tuning with online reinforcement learning, enabling strategic alternation between low-level and high-level actions. Experiments with our 7B and 32B models demonstrate substantial improvements over state-of-the-art agents. On OSWorld, UltraCUA models achieve an average 22% relative improvement over base models, while being 11% faster in terms of steps. Out-of-domain evaluation on WindowsAgentArena shows our model reaches 21.7% success rate, outperforming baselines trained on Windows data. The hybrid action mechanism proves critical, reducing error propagation while maintaining execution efficiency.</p></details> |  |

We analyze five prominent approaches: (1) MCP Registry (centralized publication of mcp.json descriptors), (2) A2A Agent Cards (decentralized self-describing JSON capability manifests), (3) AGNTCY Agent Directory Service (IPFS Kademlia DHT content routing extended for semantic taxonomy-based content discovery, OCI artifact storage, and Sigstore-backed integrity), (4) Microsoft Entra Agent ID (enterprise SaaS directory with policy and zero-trust integration), and (5) NANDA Index AgentFacts (cryptographically verifiable, privacy-preserving fact model with credentialed assertions). Using four evaluation dimensions: security, authentication, scalability, and maintainability, we surface architectural trade-offs between centralized control, enterprise governance, and distributed resilience. We conclude with design recommendations for an emerging Internet of AI Agents requiring verifiable identity, adaptive discovery flows, and interoperable capability semantics.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Principle of Targeted Intervention for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17697v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Steering cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) towards desired outcomes is challenging, particularly when the global guidance from a human on the whole multi-agent system is impractical in a large-scale MARL. On the other hand, designing mechanisms to coordinate agents most relies on empirical studies, lacking a easy-to-use research tool. In this work, we employ multi-agent influence diagrams (MAIDs) as a graphical framework to address the above issues. First, we introduce interaction paradigms that leverage MAIDs to analyze and visualize existing approaches in MARL. Then, we design a new interaction paradigm based on MAIDs, referred to as targeted intervention that is applied to only a single targeted agent, so the problem of global guidance can be mitigated. In our implementation, we introduce a causal inference technique-referred to as Pre-Strategy Intervention (PSI)-to realize the targeted intervention paradigm. Since MAIDs can be regarded as a special class of causal diagrams, a composite desired outcome that integrates the primary task goal and an additional desired outcome can be achieved by maximizing the corresponding causal effect through the PSI. Moreover, the bundled relevance graph analysis of MAIDs provides a tool to identify whether an MARL learning paradigm is workable under the design of an interaction paradigm. In experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed targeted intervention, and verify the result of relevance graph analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[A Mimamsa Inspired Framework For Instruction Sequencing In AI Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17691v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a formal framework for sequencing instructions in AI agents, inspired by the Indian philosophical system of Mimamsa. The framework formalizes sequencing mechanisms through action object pairs in three distinct ways: direct assertion (Srutikrama) for temporal precedence, purpose driven sequencing (Arthakrama) for functional dependencies, and iterative procedures (Pravrittikrama) for distinguishing between parallel and sequential execution in repetitive tasks. It introduces the syntax and semantics of an action object imperative logic, extending the MIRA formalism (Srinivasan and Parthasarathi, 2021) with explicit deduction rules for sequencing. The correctness of instruction sequencing is established through a validated theorem, which is based on object dependencies across successive instructions. This is further supported by proofs of soundness and completeness. This formal verification enables reliable instruction sequencing, impacting AI applications across areas like task planning and robotics by addressing temporal reasoning and dependency modeling.</p></details> | 16 pages |

However, existing methods often yield unstructured meshes and exhibit poor interactivity, making them impractical for artistic workflows. To address these limitations, we represent 3D assets as shape programs and introduce ShapeCraft, a novel multi-agent framework for text-to-3D generation. At its core, we propose a Graph-based Procedural Shape (GPS) representation that decomposes complex natural language into a structured graph of sub-tasks, thereby facilitating accurate LLM comprehension and interpretation of spatial relationships and semantic shape details. Specifically, LLM agents hierarchically parse user input to initialize GPS, then iteratively refine procedural modeling and painting to produce structured, textured, and interactive 3D assets. Qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate ShapeCraft's superior performance in generating geometrically accurate and semantically rich 3D assets compared to existing LLM-based agents. We further show the versatility of ShapeCraft through examples of animated and user-customized editing, highlighting its potential for broader interactive applications.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 Poster |

Supervised detection models require domain-specific training data and fail to generalize across diverse manipulation tactics. We present MIRAGE, an inference-time, model-pluggable agentic framework that decomposes multimodal verification into four sequential modules: visual veracity assessment detects AI-generated images, cross-modal consistency analysis identifies out-of-context repurposing, retrieval-augmented factual checking grounds claims in web evidence through iterative question generation, and a calibrated judgment module integrates all signals. MIRAGE orchestrates vision-language model reasoning with targeted web retrieval, outputs structured and citation-linked rationales. On MMFakeBench validation set (1,000 samples), MIRAGE with GPT-4o-mini achieves 81.65% F1 and 75.1% accuracy, outperforming the strongest zero-shot baseline (GPT-4V with MMD-Agent at 74.0% F1) by 7.65 points while maintaining 34.3% false positive rate versus 97.3% for a judge-only baseline. Test set results (5,000 samples) confirm generalization with 81.44% F1 and 75.08% accuracy. Ablation studies show visual verification contributes 5.18 F1 points and retrieval-augmented reasoning contributes 2.97 points. Our results demonstrate that decomposed agentic reasoning with web retrieval can match supervised detector performance without domain-specific training, enabling misinformation detection across modalities where labeled data remains scarce.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 3 tables, 1 figure</p></details> |
| **[ScreenCoder: Advancing Visual-to-Code Generation for Front-End Automation via Modular Multimodal Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22827v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automating the transformation of user interface (UI) designs into front-end code holds significant promise for accelerating software development and democratizing design workflows. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) can translate images to code, they often fail on complex UIs, struggling to unify visual perception, layout planning, and code synthesis within a single monolithic model, which leads to frequent perception and planning errors. To address this, we propose ScreenCoder, a modular multi-agent framework that decomposes the task into three interpretable stages: grounding, planning, and generation. By assigning these distinct responsibilities to specialized agents, our framework achieves significantly higher robustness and fidelity than end-to-end approaches. Furthermore, ScreenCoder serves as a scalable data engine, enabling us to generate high-quality image-code pairs. We use this data to fine-tune open-source MLLM via a dual-stage pipeline of supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, demonstrating substantial gains in its UI generation capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in layout accuracy, structural coherence, and code correctness.

Existing solutions often treat sketch evaluation as either an image classification task or monolithic vision-language models, which lack interpretability, pedagogical alignment, and adaptability across cognitive levels. To address these limitations, we present SketchMind, a cognitively grounded, multi-agent framework for evaluating and improving student-drawn scientific sketches. SketchMind comprises modular agents responsible for rubric parsing, sketch perception, cognitive alignment, and iterative feedback with sketch modification, enabling personalized and transparent evaluation. We evaluate SketchMind on a curated dataset of 3,575 student-generated sketches across six science assessment items with different highest order of Bloom's level that require students to draw models to explain phenomena. Compared to baseline GPT-4o performance without SRG (average accuracy: 55.6%), and with SRG integration achieves 77.1% average accuracy (+21.4% average absolute gain). We also demonstrate that multi-agent orchestration with SRG enhances SketchMind performance, for example, GPT-4.1 gains an average 8.9% increase in sketch prediction accuracy, outperforming single-agent pipelines across all items. Human evaluators rated the feedback and co-created sketches generated by \textsc{SketchMind} with GPT-4.1, which achieved an average of 4.1 out of 5, significantly higher than those of baseline models (e.g., 2.3 for GPT-4o). Experts noted the system's potential to meaningfully support conceptual growth through guided revision. Our code and (pending approval) dataset will be released to support reproducibility and future research in AI-driven education.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to NeurIPS2025</p></details> |
| **[Cybersecurity AI: Evaluating Agentic Cybersecurity in Attack/Defense CTFs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17521v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We empirically evaluate whether AI systems are more effective at attacking or defending in cybersecurity. Using CAI (Cybersecurity AI)'s parallel execution framework, we deployed autonomous agents in 23 Attack/Defense CTF battlegrounds. Statistical analysis reveals defensive agents achieve 54.3% unconstrained patching success versus 28.3% offensive initial access (p=0.0193), but this advantage disappears under operational constraints: when defense requires maintaining availability (23.9%) and preventing all intrusions (15.2%), no significant difference exists (p>0.05). Exploratory taxonomy analysis suggests potential patterns in vulnerability exploitation, though limited sample sizes preclude definitive conclusions. This study provides the first controlled empirical evidence challenging claims of AI attacker advantage, demonstrating that defensive effectiveness critically depends on success criteria, a nuance absent from conceptual analyses but essential for deployment. These findings underscore the urgency for defenders to adopt open-source Cybersecurity AI frameworks to maintain security equilibrium against accelerating offensive automation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Model-Free Dynamic Consensus in Multi-Agent Systems: A Q-Function Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24598v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a new method for achieving dynamic consensus in linear discrete-time homogeneous multi-agent systems (MAS) with marginally stable or unstable dynamics. The guarantee of consensus in this setting involves a set of constraints based on the graph's spectral properties, complicating the design of the coupling gains. This challenge intensifies for large-scale systems with diverse graph Laplacian spectra. The proposed approach reformulates the dynamic consensus problem with a prescribed convergence rate using a state-action value function framework inspired by optimal control theory. Specifically, a synthetic linear quadratic regulation (LQR) formulation is introduced to encode the consensus objective, enabling its translation into a convex semidefinite programming (SDP) problem. The resulting SDP is applicable in both model-based and model-free settings for jointly designing the local feedback and coupling gains. To handle the inherent non-convex feasibility conditions, a convex-concave decomposition strategy is employed. Adaptation of the method in a completely model-free set-up eliminates the need for system identification or knowledge of the agents' dynamics. Instead, it relies on input-state data collection and offers an entirely data-driven equivalent SDP formulation. Finally, a new algorithm balancing feasibility, convergence rate, robustness, and energy efficiency, is established to provide design flexibility. Numerical simulations validate the method's effectiveness in various scenarios.</p></details> |  |

However, how to translate the research on general agents into productivity that drives industry transformations remains a significant challenge. To address this, this paper systematically reviews the technologies, applications, and evaluation methods of industry agents based on LLMs. Using an industry agent capability maturity framework, it outlines the evolution of agents in industry applications, from "process execution systems" to "adaptive social systems." First, we examine the three key technological pillars that support the advancement of agent capabilities: Memory, Planning, and Tool Use. We discuss how these technologies evolve from supporting simple tasks in their early forms to enabling complex autonomous systems and collective intelligence in more advanced forms. Then, we provide an overview of the application of industry agents in real-world domains such as digital engineering, scientific discovery, embodied intelligence, collaborative business execution, and complex system simulation. Additionally, this paper reviews the evaluation benchmarks and methods for both fundamental and specialized capabilities, identifying the challenges existing evaluation systems face regarding authenticity, safety, and industry specificity. Finally, we focus on the practical challenges faced by industry agents, exploring their capability boundaries, developmental potential, and governance issues in various scenarios, while providing insights into future directions. By combining technological evolution with industry practices, this review aims to clarify the current state and offer a clear roadmap and theoretical foundation for understanding and building the next generation of industry agents.</p></details> |  |

We provide a formal answer to this question, showing that any agent capable of generalizing to multi-step goal-directed tasks must have learned a predictive model of its environment. We show that this model can be extracted from the agent's policy, and that increasing the agents performance or the complexity of the goals it can achieve requires learning increasingly accurate world models. This has a number of consequences: from developing safe and general agents, to bounding agent capabilities in complex environments, and providing new algorithms for eliciting world models from agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted ICML 2025.

Existing evaluation approaches fall into three categories, including human-centered, metric-based, and LLM-based. Considering that human-centered approaches are labour-intensive and metric-based ones overly rely on reference answers, LLM-based approaches are gaining increasing attention due to their stronger contextual understanding capabilities. However, they generally evaluate the generated code based on static prompts, and tend to fail for complex code scenarios which typically involve multiple requirements and require more contextual information. In addition, these approaches lack fine-grained evaluation for complex code, resulting in limited explainability. To mitigate the limitations, we propose CodeVisionary, the first agent-based evaluation framework for complex code generation. CodeVisionary consists of two stages: (1) Requirement-guided multi-dimensional context distillation stage and (2) Fine-grained scoring and summarization stage. A comprehensive evaluation report is also generated for enhanced explainability. For validation, we construct a new benchmark consisting of 363 samples spanning 37 coding scenarios and 23 programming languages. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CodeVisionary achieves the best performance among three baselines for evaluating complex code generation, outperforming the best baseline with average improvements of 0.217, 0.163, and 0.141 in Pearson, Spearman, and Kendall-Tau coefficients, respectively. The resources of CodeVisionary are available at https://github.com/Eshe0922/CodeVisionary.</p></details> |  |

Since there have been conflicting research findings on whether and when this hypothesis holds, there is a need to better understand the differences in their experimental designs. We focus on replicating the behavior of social network users with the use of LLMs for the analysis of communication on social networks. First, we provide a formal framework for the simulation of social networks, before focusing on the sub-task of imitating user communication. We empirically test different approaches to imitate user behavior on X in English and German. Our findings suggest that social simulations should be validated by their empirical realism measured in the setting in which the simulation components were fitted. With this paper, we argue for more rigor when applying generative-agent-based modeling for social simulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 1 figure, 3 tables</p></details> |

The aim is to reconnoiter a geographical area to maintain a common operational picture. To achieve this, we construct an evidence map that reflects our current understanding of the situation, incorporating both positive and "negative" sensor observations of possible target objects collected over time, and diffusing the evidence across the map as time progresses. The generative model of active inference uses Dempster-Shafer theory and a Gaussian sensor model, which provides input to the agent. The generative process employs a Bayesian approach to update a posterior probability distribution. We calculate the variational free energy for all positions within the area by assessing the divergence between a pignistic probability distribution of the evidence map and a posterior probability distribution of a target object based on the observations, including the level of surprise associated with receiving new observations. Using the free energy, we direct the agents' movements in a simulation by taking an incremental step toward a position that minimizes the free energy. This approach addresses the challenge of exploration and exploitation, allowing agents to balance searching extensive areas of the geographical map while tracking identified target objects.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at the 6th International Workshop on Active Inference, 15-17 October 2025, Montreal, Canada</p></details> |

| **[Agentic Reinforcement Learning for Search is Unsafe](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17431v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agentic reinforcement learning (RL) trains large language models to autonomously call tools during reasoning, with search as the most common application. These models excel at multi-step reasoning tasks, but their safety properties are not well understood. In this study, we show that RL-trained search models inherit refusal from instruction tuning and often deflect harmful requests by turning them into safe queries. However, this safety is fragile. Two simple attacks, one that forces the model to begin response with search (Search attack), another that encourages models to repeatedly search (Multi-search attack), trigger cascades of harmful searches and answers. Across two model families (Qwen, Llama) with both local and web search, these attacks lower refusal rates by up to 60.0%, answer safety by 82.5%, and search-query safety by 82.4%. The attacks succeed by triggering models to generate harmful, request-mirroring search queries before they can generate the inherited refusal tokens. This exposes a core weakness of current RL training: it rewards continued generation of effective queries without accounting for their harmfulness. As a result, RL search models have vulnerabilities that users can easily exploit, making it urgent to develop safety-aware agentic RL pipelines optimising for safe search.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we present two important steps towards this goal. First, we take the partial-order reduction scheme that was recently proved to preserve individual and coalitional abilities of memoryless agents, and show that it also works for agents with memory. Secondly, we take the Knowledge-Based Subset Construction, that was recently studied for synchronous concurrent games, and adapt it to preserve abilities of memoryful agents in asynchronous MAS. On the way, we also propose a new execution semantics for strategies in asynchronous MAS, that combines elements of Concurrent Game Structures and Interleaved Interpreted Systems in a natural and intuitive way.</p></details> |  |

To this end, we develop a hybrid framework that integrates a learned heuristic derived from MAGAT, a neural MAPF policy with a graph attention scheme, into a leading search-based algorithm, LaCAM. While prior work has explored learning-guided search in MAPF, such methods have historically underperformed. In contrast, our approach, termed LaGAT, outperforms both purely search-based and purely learning-based methods in dense scenarios. This is achieved through an enhanced MAGAT architecture, a pre-train-then-fine-tune strategy on maps of interest, and a deadlock detection scheme to account for imperfect neural guidance. Our results demonstrate that, when carefully designed, hybrid search offers a powerful solution for tightly coupled, challenging multi-agent coordination problems.</p></details> |  |

Recently proposed defenses, such as LlamaFirewall, rely on alignment checks of inter-agent communications to ensure that all agent invocations are "related to" and "likely to further" the original objective. We start by demonstrating control-flow hijacking attacks that evade these defenses even if alignment checks are performed by advanced LLMs. We argue that the safety and functionality objectives of multi-agent systems fundamentally conflict with each other. This conflict is exacerbated by the brittle definitions of "alignment" and the checkers' incomplete visibility into the execution context. We then propose, implement, and evaluate ControlValve, a new defense inspired by the principles of control-flow integrity and least privilege. ControlValve (1) generates permitted control-flow graphs for multi-agent systems, and (2) enforces that all executions comply with these graphs, along with contextual rules (generated in a zero-shot manner) for each agent invocation.</p></details> |  |

This paper assesses multiple approaches to Rocq generation and illuminates potential avenues for improvement. We highlight the importance of thorough premise selection for generating Rocq proofs and propose a novel approach, leveraging retrieval via a self-attentive embedder model. The evaluation of the designed approach shows up to 28% relative increase of the generator's performance. We tackle the problem of writing Rocq proofs using a multi-stage agentic system, tailored for formal verification, and demonstrate its high effectiveness. We conduct an ablation study and demonstrate shows that incorporating multi-agent debate during the planning stage increases the proof success rate by 20% overall and nearly doubles it for complex theorems, while the reflection mechanism further enhances stability and consistency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Coinvisor: An RL-Enhanced Chatbot Agent for Interactive Cryptocurrency Investment Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17235v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The cryptocurrency market offers significant investment opportunities but faces challenges including high volatility and fragmented information. Data integration and analysis are essential for informed investment decisions. Currently, investors use three main approaches: (1) Manual analysis across various sources, which depends heavily on individual experience and is time-consuming and prone to bias; (2) Data aggregation platforms-limited in functionality and depth of analysis; (3) Large language model agents-based on static pretrained models, lacking real-time data integration and multi-step reasoning capabilities. To address these limitations, we present Coinvisor, a reinforcement learning-based chatbot that provides comprehensive analytical support for cryptocurrency investment through a multi-agent framework. Coinvisor integrates diverse analytical capabilities through specialized tools. Its key innovation is a reinforcement learning-based tool selection mechanism that enables multi-step planning and flexible integration of diverse data sources. This design supports real-time interaction and adaptive analysis of dynamic content, delivering accurate and actionable investment insights. We evaluated Coinvisor through automated benchmarks on tool calling accuracy and user studies with 20 cryptocurrency investors using our interface. Results show that Coinvisor improves recall by 40.7% and F1 score by 26.6% over the base model in tool orchestration. User studies show high satisfaction (4.64/5), with participants preferring Coinvisor to both general LLMs and existing crypto platforms (4.62/5).</p></details> |  |

Among these AI agents, deep research agent is a key category as it can perform long-horizon tasks and solve problems of greater complexity. However, there are few evaluation frameworks and benchmarks that systematically and automatically investigate the capabilities of these research agents. In addition, financial research problems have distinct complexity and subtlety. To fill in the gap, we propose FinResearchBench, which is a logic tree-based Agent-as-a-Judge and targets specifically for the financial research agents. It provides a comprehensive and automatic assessment of the research agents across 7 key types of tasks in the financial research domain. The contributions of this work are two-folded: (1) the first and innovative Agent-as-a-Judge system that extracts the logic tree of the research outcome and uses it as the intermediate information to present a comprehensive, reliable, and robust evaluation; (2) finance-oriented that it covers 70 typical financial research questions, spreading across 7 frequently encountered types of task in the domain.</p></details> |  |

We position Agentic Science as a pivotal stage within the broader AI for Science paradigm, where AI systems progress from partial assistance to full scientific agency. Enabled by large language models (LLMs), multimodal systems, and integrated research platforms, agentic AI shows capabilities in hypothesis generation, experimental design, execution, analysis, and iterative refinement -- behaviors once regarded as uniquely human. This survey provides a domain-oriented review of autonomous scientific discovery across life sciences, chemistry, materials science, and physics. We unify three previously fragmented perspectives -- process-oriented, autonomy-oriented, and mechanism-oriented -- through a comprehensive framework that connects foundational capabilities, core processes, and domain-specific realizations. Building on this framework, we (i) trace the evolution of AI for Science, (ii) identify five core capabilities underpinning scientific agency, (iii) model discovery as a dynamic four-stage workflow, (iv) review applications across the above domains, and (v) synthesize key challenges and future opportunities. This work establishes a domain-oriented synthesis of autonomous scientific discovery and positions Agentic Science as a structured paradigm for advancing AI-driven research.</p></details> |  |

In practice, many privacy-preserving mechanisms build on differential privacy (DP). However, static DP mechanisms often fail to adapt to evolving risks, for example, shifts in adversarial capabilities, resource constraints and task requirements, resulting in either excessive noise or inadequate protection. To address this challenge, we propose ALPINE, a lightweight, adaptive framework that empowers terminal devices to autonomously adjust differential privacy levels in real time. ALPINE operates as a closed-loop control system consisting of four modules: dynamic risk perception, privacy decision via twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3), local privacy execution and performance verification from edge nodes. Based on environmental risk assessments, we design a reward function that balances privacy gains, data utility and energy cost, guiding the TD3 agent to adaptively tune noise magnitude across diverse risk scenarios and achieve a dynamic equilibrium among privacy, utility and cost. Both the collaborative risk model and pretrained TD3-based agent are designed for low-overhead deployment. Extensive theoretical analysis and real-world simulations demonstrate that ALPINE effectively mitigates inference attacks while preserving utility and cost, making it practical for large-scale edge applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 8 figures, 4 tables.

Despite the existence of diverse protocols (A2A, ACP, ANP, Agora, etc.), selection is often intuition-driven and lacks standardized guidance. We introduce ProtocolBench, a benchmark that systematically compares agent protocols along four measurable axes: task success, end-to-end latency, message or byte overhead, and robustness under failures. On ProtocolBench, protocol choice significantly influences system behavior. In the Streaming Queue scenario, overall completion time varies by up to 36.5% across protocols, and mean end-to-end latency differs by 3.48 s. Under Fail-Storm Recovery, resilience also differs consistently across protocols. Beyond evaluation, we present ProtocolRouter, a learnable protocol router that selects per-scenario (or per-module) protocols from requirement and runtime signals. ProtocolRouter reduces Fail-Storm recovery time by up to 18.1% versus the best single-protocol baseline, and achieves scenario-specific gains such as higher success in GAIA. We also release ProtocolRouterBench to standardize protocol evaluation and improve reliability at scale.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review at ICLR 2026.Code and benchmark artifacts: https://github.com/ulab-uiuc/AgentProtocols</p></details> |
| **[When LLM Agents Meet Graph Optimization: An Automated Data Quality Improvement Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08952v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-attributed graphs (TAGs) have become a key form of graph-structured data in modern data management and analytics, combining structural relationships with rich textual semantics for diverse applications. However, the effectiveness of analytical models, particularly graph neural networks (GNNs), is highly sensitive to data quality. Our empirical analysis shows that both conventional and LLM-enhanced GNNs degrade notably under textual, structural, and label imperfections, underscoring TAG quality as a key bottleneck for reliable analytics. Existing studies have explored data-level optimization for TAGs, but most focus on specific degradation types and target a single aspect like structure or label, lacking a systematic and comprehensive perspective on data quality improvement. To address this gap, we propose LAGA (Large Language and Graph Agent), a unified multi-agent framework for comprehensive TAG quality optimization. LAGA formulates graph quality control as a data-centric process, integrating detection, planning, action, and evaluation agents into an automated loop. It holistically enhances textual, structural, and label aspects through coordinated multi-modal optimization. Extensive experiments on 5 datasets and 16 baselines across 9 scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness, robustness and scalability of LAGA, confirming the importance of data-centric quality optimization for reliable TAG analytics.</p></details> | 12 pages, 7figures |

We propose COMPASS, a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework that enables decentralized agents to persistently monitor multiple moving targets efficiently. We model the environment as a graph, where nodes represent spatial locations and edges capture topological proximity, allowing agents to reason over structured layouts and revisit informative regions as needed. Each agent independently selects actions based on a shared spatio-temporal attention network that we design to integrate historical observations and spatial context. We model target dynamics using Gaussian Processes (GPs), which support principled belief updates and enable uncertainty-aware planning. We train COMPASS using centralized value estimation and decentralized policy execution under an adaptive reward setting. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that COMPASS consistently outperforms strong baselines in uncertainty reduction, target coverage, and coordination efficiency across dynamic multi-target scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE MRS 2025</p></details> |

However, these models primarily operate in disembodied digital environments and lack interaction with the physical world. To address this limitation, Embodied Artificial Intelligence (EAI) has emerged, focusing on agents that can perceive and interact with their surroundings. Despite progress, current embodied agents face challenges in unstructured real-world environments due to insufficient semantic intelligence, which is critical for understanding and reasoning about complex tasks. This paper introduces the Semantic Intelligence-Driven Embodied (SIDE) agent framework, which integrates a hierarchical semantic cognition architecture with a semantic-driven decision-making process. This enables agents to reason about and interact with the physical world in a contextually adaptive manner. The framework is inspired by biological cognitive mechanisms and utilizes bio-inspired principles to design a semantic cognitive architecture that mimics how humans and animals integrate and process sensory information. We present this framework as a step toward developing more intelligent and versatile embodied agents.</p></details> |  |

In support of this position, we build from prior scientific literature and current product marketing to delineate different AI agent levels and detail the ethical values at play in each, documenting trade-offs in potential benefits and risks. Our analysis reveals that risks to people increase with the autonomy of a system: The more control a user cedes to an AI agent, the more risks to people arise. Particularly concerning are safety risks, which affect human life and impact further values.</p></details> |  |

While many studies focus on CAs for individual psychological care, research on agents designed for couples facing relational or emotional challenges remains limited. This study aims to identify design considerations for CAs that address the relational context of couples and support their well-being. Following PRISMA guidelines, a systematic review was conducted across seven databases: CINAHL, Embase, PubMed, PsycINFO, Scopus, Web of Science, and the ACM Digital Library. Peer-reviewed empirical studies were screened, duplicates removed, and selection criteria applied, resulting in twelve studies for analysis. Thematic analysis was conducted across three dimensions: AI interaction design, relational framing, and technical limitations. Three key themes emerged: (1) the need for a relational expert persona, (2) technological directions leveraging state-of-the-art AI for relational specificity and emotional competence, and (3) a shift from content-centered to relationship-centered design. Based on these insights, eight design considerations are proposed for couple-oriented CAs: (1) agent persona, (2) individual mode, (3) concurrent mode, (4) conjoint mode, (5) ethics, (6) data and privacy, (7) interaction pattern, and (8) safety mechanism. These principles guide CAs as relational mediators capable of maintaining multiple alliances, respecting cultural and ethical boundaries, and ensuring fairness and emotional safety between partners. Ultimately, this review introduces a design framework that integrates relational theory with advanced AI technologies to inform future development of CAs for couple-based mental health interventions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Verification-Aware Planning for Multi-Agent Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17109v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM) agents are increasingly deployed to tackle complex tasks, often necessitating collaboration among multiple specialized agents. However, multi-agent collaboration introduces new challenges in planning, coordination, and verification. Execution failures frequently arise not from flawed reasoning alone, but from subtle misalignments in task interpretation, output format, or inter-agent handoffs. To address these challenges, we present VeriMAP, a framework for multi-agent collaboration with verification-aware planning. The VeriMAP planner decomposes tasks, models subtask dependencies, and encodes planner-defined passing criteria as subtask verification functions (VFs) in Python and natural language. We evaluate VeriMAP on diverse datasets, demonstrating that it outperforms both single- and multi-agent baselines while enhancing system robustness and interpretability. Our analysis highlights how verification-aware planning enables reliable coordination and iterative refinement in multi-agent systems, without relying on external labels or annotations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submission for ARR Oct</p></details> |
| **[Value-Based Large Language Model Agent Simulation for Mutual Evaluation of Trust and Interpersonal Closeness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11979v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for simulating complex social phenomena using human-like agents with specific traits. In human societies, value similarity is important for building trust and close relationships; however, it remains unexplored whether this principle holds true in artificial societies comprising LLM agents. Therefore, this study investigates the influence of value similarity on relationship-building among LLM agents through two experiments. First, in a preliminary experiment, we evaluated the controllability of values in LLMs to identify the most effective model and prompt design for controlling the values. Subsequently, in the main experiment, we generated pairs of LLM agents imbued with specific values and analyzed their mutual evaluations of trust and interpersonal closeness following a dialogue. The experiments were conducted in English and Japanese to investigate language dependence. The results confirmed that pairs of agents with higher value similarity exhibited greater mutual trust and interpersonal closeness. Our findings demonstrate that the LLM agent simulation serves as a valid testbed for social science theories, contributes to elucidating the mechanisms by which values influence relationship building, and provides a foundation for inspiring new theories and insights into the social sciences.</p></details> |  |

However, annotating these signatures-especially those involving poorly characterized genes-remains a major challenge. Traditional methods, such as Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), depend on well-curated annotations and often perform poorly in these contexts. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative but struggle to represent complex biological knowledge within structured ontologies. To address this, we present BRAINCELL-AID (BRAINCELL-AID: https://biodataai.uth.edu/BRAINCELL-AID), a novel multi-agent AI system that integrates free-text descriptions with ontology labels to enable more accurate and robust gene set annotation. By incorporating retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), we developed a robust agentic workflow that refines predictions using relevant PubMed literature, reducing hallucinations and enhancing interpretability. Using this workflow, we achieved correct annotations for 77% of mouse gene sets among their top predictions. Applying this approach, we annotated 5,322 brain cell clusters from the comprehensive mouse brain cell atlas generated by the BRAIN Initiative Cell Census Network, enabling novel insights into brain cell function by identifying region-specific gene co-expression patterns and inferring functional roles of gene ensembles. BRAINCELL-AID also identifies Basal Ganglia-related cell types with neurologically meaningful descriptions. Hence, we create a valuable resource to support community-driven cell type annotation.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

While researchers have primarily focused on improving their utility, their safety behaviors remain underexplored. In this paper, we first evaluate search agents using red-teaming datasets and find that they are more likely to produce harmful outputs than base LLMs. For example, when asked ``How can I track someone's location without their consent?'', a base model refuses, whereas a search agent designed to retrieve and cite sources may lower its refusal threshold, fetch documents (e.g., court cases), and, once appended, synthesize them into an informative yet unsafe summary. We further show that utility-oriented fine-tuning intensifies this risk, motivating joint alignment of safety and utility. We present SafeSearch, a multi-objective reinforcement learning approach that couples a final-output safety/utility reward with a novel query-level shaping term that penalizes unsafe queries and rewards safe ones. Experiments show that SafeSearch reduces agent harmfulness by over 70% across three red-teaming datasets while producing safe, helpful responses, and matches the QA performance of a utility-only finetuned agent; further analyses confirm the effectiveness of the query-level reward in jointly improving safety and utility.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/ZQS1943/SafeSearch</p></details> |

Addressing this need, this manuscript presents ReclAIm, a multi-agent framework capable of autonomously monitoring, evaluating, and fine-tuning medical image classification models. The system, built on a large language model core, operates entirely through natural language interaction, eliminating the need for programming expertise. ReclAIm successfully trains, evaluates, and maintains consistent performance of models across MRI, CT, and X-ray datasets. Once ReclAIm detects significant performance degradation, it autonomously executes state-of-the-art fine-tuning procedures that substantially reduce the performance gap. In cases with performance drops of up to -41.1% (MRI InceptionV3), ReclAIm managed to readjust performance metrics within 1.5% of the initial model results. ReclAIm enables automated, continuous maintenance of medical imaging AI models in a user-friendly and adaptable manner that facilitates broader adoption in both research and clinical environments.</p></details> | 25 pages, 4 figures |

While recent large language model (LLM)-based approaches have shown promise in circuit topology generation and device sizing, most rely solely on textual representations such as SPICE netlists, which lack visual interpretability for circuit designers. To address this limitation, we propose EEschematic, an AI agent for automatic analog schematic generation based on a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). EEschematic integrates textual, visual, and symbolic modalities to translate SPICE netlists into schematic diagrams represented in a human-editable format. The framework uses six analog substructure examples for few-shot placement and a Visual Chain-of-Thought (VCoT) strategy to iteratively refine placement and wiring, enhancing schematic clarity and symmetry. Experimental results on representative analog circuits, including a CMOS inverter, a five-transistor operational transconductance amplifier (5T-OTA), and a telescopic cascode amplifier, demonstrate that EEschematic produces schematics with high visual quality and structural correctness.</p></details> |  |

While recent advances in large language models (LLMs) provide new opportunities for automated code generation, existing approaches largely treat LLMs as single-shot generators or naive refinement tools, limiting their effectiveness in navigating the irregular kernel optimization landscape. We introduce an LLM agentic framework for GPU kernel optimization that systematically explores the design space through multi-agent collaboration, grounded instruction, dynamic context management, and strategic search. This framework mimics the workflow of expert engineers, enabling LLMs to reason about hardware trade-offs, incorporate profiling feedback, and refine kernels iteratively. We evaluate our approach on KernelBench, a benchmark for LLM-based kernel optimization, and demonstrate substantial improvements over baseline agents: our system produces correct solutions where baselines often fail, and achieves kernels with up to 16x faster runtime performance. These results highlight the potential of agentic LLM frameworks to advance fully automated, scalable GPU kernel optimization.</p></details> |  |

To address verbosity and stakeholder trade-offs, we integrate four mechanisms: (i) plasticity, which applies concise adjustments to candidate solutions; (ii) duplication and maturation, which copy high-performing candidates and specialize them into new modules; (iii) ranked-choice stakeholder aggregation using influence-weighted Borda scoring; and (iv) compute awareness via token-based penalties that reward brevity. The system iteratively proposes diverse strategies, applies plasticity tweaks, simulates stakeholder evaluations, aggregates preferences, selects top candidates, and performs duplication/maturation while factoring compute cost into final scores. In a controlled evaluation over 30 rounds comparing 14 systems, Lark Full achieves a mean rank of 2.55 (95% CI [2.17, 2.93]) and a mean composite score of 29.4/50 (95% CI [26.34, 32.46]), finishing Top-3 in 80% of rounds while remaining cost competitive with leading commercial models ($0.016 per task). Paired Wilcoxon tests confirm that all four mechanisms contribute significantly as ablating duplication/maturation yields the largest deficit ({\Delta}Score = 3.5, Cohen's d_z = 2.53, p < 0.001), followed by plasticity ({\Delta}Score = 3.4, d_z = 1.86), ranked-choice voting ({\Delta}Score = 2.4, d_z = 1.20), and token penalties ({\Delta}Score = 2.2, d_z = 1.63). Rather than a formal Markov Decision Process with constrained optimization, Lark is a practical, compute-aware neuroevolutionary loop that scales stakeholder-aligned strategy generation and makes trade-offs transparent through per-step metrics. Our work presents proof-of-concept findings and invites community feedback as we expand toward real-world validation studies.</p></details> | <details><summary>39th ...</summary><p>39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025) Workshop: NeurIPS 2025 Workshop on Efficient Reasoning</p></details> |

In single-agent settings, the problem has been extensively studied and mostly understood. A popular approach, called task-agnostic exploration, casts the unsupervised objective as maximizing the entropy of the state distribution induced by the agent's policy, from which principles and methods follow. In contrast, little is known about it in multi-agent settings, which are ubiquitous in the real world. What are the pros and cons of alternative problem formulations in this setting? How hard is the problem in theory, how can we solve it in practice? In this paper, we address these questions by first characterizing those alternative formulations and highlighting how the problem, even when tractable in theory, is non-trivial in practice. Then, we present a scalable, decentralized, trust-region policy search algorithm to address the problem in practical settings. Finally, we provide numerical validations to both corroborate the theoretical findings and pave the way for unsupervised multi-agent reinforcement learning via task-agnostic exploration in challenging domains, showing that optimizing for a specific objective, namely mixture entropy, provides an excellent trade-off between tractability and performances.</p></details> |  |
| **[VAGEN: Reinforcing World Model Reasoning for Multi-Turn VLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16907v1)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A key challenge in training Vision-Language Model (VLM) agents, compared to Language Model (LLM) agents, lies in the shift from textual states to complex visual observations. This transition introduces partial observability and demands robust world modeling. We ask: Can VLM agents construct internal world models through explicit visual state reasoning? To address this question, we architecturally enforce and reward the agent's reasoning process via reinforcement learning (RL), formulating it as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP). We find that decomposing the agent's reasoning into State Estimation ("what is the current state?") and Transition Modeling ("what comes next?") is critical for success, as demonstrated through five reasoning strategies. Our investigation into how agents represent internal beliefs reveals that the optimal representation is task-dependent: Natural Language excels at capturing semantic relationships in general tasks, while Structured formats are indispensable for precise manipulation and control. Building on these insights, we design a World Modeling Reward that provides dense, turn-level supervision for accurate state prediction, and introduce Bi-Level General Advantage Estimation (Bi-Level GAE) for turn-aware credit assignment. Through this form of visual state reasoning, a 3B-parameter model achieves a score of 0.82 across five diverse agent benchmarks, representing a 3$\times$ improvement over its untrained counterpart (0.21) and outperforming proprietary reasoning models such as GPT-5 (0.75), Gemini 2.5 Pro (0.67) and Claude 4.5 (0.62).

Recent workflow-based data agents have shown promising results on specific data tasks but remain fundamentally limited in achieving fully autonomous data science due to their reliance on predefined workflows. In this paper, we introduce DeepAnalyze-8B, the first agentic LLM designed for autonomous data science, capable of automatically completing the end-toend pipeline from data sources to analyst-grade deep research reports. To tackle high-complexity data science tasks, we propose a curriculum-based agentic training paradigm that emulates the learning trajectory of human data scientists, enabling LLMs to progressively acquire and integrate multiple capabilities in real-world environments. We also introduce a data-grounded trajectory synthesis framework that constructs high-quality training data. Through agentic training, DeepAnalyze learns to perform a broad spectrum of data tasks, ranging from data question answering and specialized analytical tasks to open-ended data research.

As these systems become integrated into political and economic life, their distribution and capabilities will be highly consequential. This paper introduces and explores "agentic inequality" - the potential disparities in power, opportunity, and outcomes stemming from differential access to, and capabilities of, AI agents. We analyse the dual potential of this technology, exploring how agents could both exacerbate existing divides and, under the right conditions, serve as a powerful equalising force. To this end, the paper makes three primary contributions. First, it establishes an analytical framework by delineating the three core dimensions through which this inequality can manifest: disparities in the availability, quality, and quantity of agents. Second, it argues that agentic inequality is distinct from prior technological divides. Unlike tools that primarily augment human abilities, agents act as autonomous delegates, creating novel power asymmetries through scalable goal delegation and direct agent-to-agent competition that are poised to reshape outcomes across economic and socio-political spheres. Finally, it provides a systematic analysis of the technical and socioeconomic drivers - from model release strategies to market incentives - that will shape the distribution of agentic power, concluding with a research agenda for navigating the complex governance challenges ahead.</p></details> |  |
| **[More with Less: An Empirical Study of Turn-Control Strategies for Efficient Coding Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16786v1)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM-powered coding agents, which operate in iterative loops (turns) to solve software engineering tasks, are becoming increasingly powerful. However, their practical deployment is hindered by significant and unpredictable costs. This challenge arises from a combination of factors: quadratically growing token counts with each turn, the high price of models, the large number of turns required for real-world tasks, and the tendency of agents to take inefficient or unnecessary actions. While existing research focuses on optimizing individual turns, the strategic control of the total number of turns remains an underexplored area for managing agent performance and cost. To address this gap, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study on SWE-bench using three state-of-the-art models and evaluate the impact of three distinct turn-control strategies: an unrestricted baseline, a fixed-turn limit with reminders, and a novel dynamic-turn strategy that grants extensions on-demand. Our findings first reveal a fundamental trade-off in the unrestricted setting, where no single model excels across performance, cost, and turn efficiency. We then show that a fixed-turn limit, specifically at the 75th percentile of the baseline, serves as a "sweet spot", substantially reducing costs (by 24%-68%) with minimal impact on solve rates. Most significantly, the dynamic-turn strategy consistently outperforms fixed-limit approaches, achieving comparable or better solve rates while further reducing costs by an additional 12%-24% by intelligently allocating resources only to tasks that need them. This work provides the first systematic analysis of turn-control strategies, offering simple yet effective guidelines for developers to balance cost and efficacy. We demonstrate that dynamic resource allocation is a superior, easy-to-implement approach for deploying powerful yet economically viable coding agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Empirical Study on LLM-based Agents for Automated Bug Fixing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10213v2)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) and LLM-based Agents have been applied to fix bugs automatically, demonstrating the capability in addressing software defects by engaging in development environment interaction, iterative validation and code modification. However, systematic analysis of these agent systems remain limited, particularly regarding performance variations among top-performing ones. In this paper, we examine six repair systems on the SWE-bench Verified benchmark for automated bug fixing. We first assess each system's overall performance, noting the instances solvable by all or none of these systems, and explore the capabilities of different systems. We also compare fault localization accuracy at file and code symbol levels and evaluate bug reproduction capabilities. Through analysis, we concluded that further optimization is needed in both the LLM capability itself and the design of Agentic flow to improve the effectiveness of the Agent in bug fixing.</p></details> |  |

We first describe our dataset of human game-play, collected across a large variety of 3-D first-person games, which is both substantially larger and more diverse compared to prior publicly disclosed datasets, and contains text instructions. We demonstrate that we can learn an inverse dynamics model from this dataset, which allows us to impute actions on a much larger dataset of publicly available videos of human game play that lack recorded actions. We then train a text-conditioned agent for game playing using behavior cloning, with a custom architecture capable of realtime inference on a consumer GPU. We show the resulting model is capable of playing a variety of 3-D games and responding to text input. Finally, we outline some of the remaining challenges such as long-horizon tasks and quantitative evaluation across a large set of games.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inter...</summary><p>International Conference on Computer Vision Workshop on Multi-Modal Reasoning for Agentic Intelligence</p></details> |

To address these challenges, we propose GraphVista, a unified framework that enhances both scalability and modality coordination in graph understanding. For scalability, GraphVista organizes graph information hierarchically into a lightweight GraphRAG base, which retrieves only task-relevant textual descriptions and high-resolution visual subgraphs, compressing redundant context while preserving key reasoning elements. For modality coordination, GraphVista introduces a planning agent that routes tasks to the most suitable modality-using the text modality for simple property reasoning and the visual modality for local and structurally complex reasoning grounded in explicit topology. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GraphVista scales to large graphs, up to $200\times$ larger than those used in existing benchmarks, and consistently outperforms existing textual, visual, and fusion-based methods, achieving up to $4.4\times$ quality improvement over the state-of-the-art baselines by fully exploiting the complementary strengths of both modalities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Language Agent Strategic Reasoning through Self-Play in Adversarial Games](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16761v1)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing language agents often encounter difficulties in dynamic adversarial games due to poor strategic reasoning. To mitigate this limitation, a promising approach is to allow agents to learn from game interactions automatically, without relying on costly expert-labeled data. Unlike static environments where agents receive fixed feedback or rewards, selecting appropriate opponents in dynamic adversarial games can significantly impact learning performance. However, the discussion of opponents in adversarial environments remains an area under exploration. In this paper, we propose a Step-level poliCy Optimization method through Play-And-Learn, SCO-PAL. Leveraging SCO-PAL, we conduct a detailed analysis of opponent selection by setting opponents at different levels and find that self-play is the most effective way to improve strategic reasoning in such adversarial environments. Utilizing SCO-PAL with self-play, we increase the average win rate against four opponents by approximately 30% compared to baselines and achieve a 54.76% win rate against GPT-4 in six adversarial games.</p></details> |  |
| **[AGENTSAFE: Benchmarking the Safety of Embodied Agents on Hazardous Instructions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14697v3)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of vision-language models (VLMs) is driving a new generation of embodied agents capable of operating in human-centered environments. However, as deployment expands, these systems face growing safety risks, particularly when executing hazardous instructions. Current safety evaluation benchmarks remain limited: they cover only narrow scopes of hazards and focus primarily on final outcomes, neglecting the agent's full perception-planning-execution process and thereby obscuring critical failure modes. Therefore, we present SAFE, a benchmark for systematically assessing the safety of embodied VLM agents on hazardous instructions. SAFE comprises three components: SAFE-THOR, an extensible adversarial simulation sandbox with a universal adapter that maps high-level VLM outputs to low-level embodied controls, supporting diverse agent workflow integration; SAFE-VERSE, a risk-aware task suite inspired by Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics, comprising 45 adversarial scenarios, 1,350 hazardous tasks, and 9,900 instructions that span risks to humans, environments, and agents; and SAFE-DIAGNOSE, a multi-level and fine-grained evaluation protocol measuring agent performance across perception, planning, and execution. Applying SAFE to nine state-of-the-art VLMs and two embodied agent workflows, we uncover systematic failures in translating hazard recognition into safe planning and execution. Our findings reveal fundamental limitations in current safety alignment and demonstrate the necessity of a comprehensive, multi-stage evaluation for developing safer embodied intelligence.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Comprehensive Survey on Reinforcement Learning-based Agentic Search: Foundations, Roles, Optimizations, Evaluations, and Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16724v1)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advent of large language models (LLMs) has transformed information access and reasoning through open-ended natural language interaction. However, LLMs remain limited by static knowledge, factual hallucinations, and the inability to retrieve real-time or domain-specific information. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates these issues by grounding model outputs in external evidence, but traditional RAG pipelines are often single turn and heuristic, lacking adaptive control over retrieval and reasoning. Recent advances in agentic search address these limitations by enabling LLMs to plan, retrieve, and reflect through multi-step interaction with search environments. Within this paradigm, reinforcement learning (RL) offers a powerful mechanism for adaptive and self-improving search behavior. This survey provides the first comprehensive overview of \emph{RL-based agentic search}, organizing the emerging field along three complementary dimensions: (i) What RL is for (functional roles), (ii) How RL is used (optimization strategies), and (iii) Where RL is applied (scope of optimization). We summarize representative methods, evaluation protocols, and applications, and discuss open challenges and future directions toward building reliable and scalable RL driven agentic search systems. We hope this survey will inspire future research on the integration of RL and agentic search.

Given recent advances in large language models (LLMs), we ask whether they, too, can learn to create. We approach this question through the lens of compositional machine design: a task in which machines are assembled from standardized components to meet functional demands like locomotion or manipulation in a simulated physical environment. With this simplification, machine design is expressed as writing XML-like code that explicitly specifies pairwise part connections. To support this investigation, we introduce BesiegeField, a testbed built on the machine-building game Besiege, which enables part-based construction, physical simulation and reward-driven evaluation. Using BesiegeField, we benchmark state-of-the-art LLMs with agentic workflows and identify key capabilities required for success, including spatial reasoning, strategic assembly, and instruction-following. As current open-source models fall short, we explore reinforcement learning (RL) as a path to improvement: we curate a cold-start dataset, conduct RL finetuning experiments, and highlight open challenges at the intersection of language, machine design, and physical reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>75 pa...</summary><p>75 pages, 31 figures, Project Page: https://besiegefield.github.io</p></details> |
| **[Programmable Cognitive Bias in Social Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13588v2)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces CoBRA, a novel toolkit for systematically specifying agent behavior in LLM-based social simulation. We found that conventional approaches that specify agent behaviors through implicit natural language descriptions cannot yield consistent behaviors across models, and the produced agent behaviors do not capture the nuances of the descriptions. In contrast, CoBRA presents a new approach to program agents' cognitive biases explicitly, by grounding agents' expected behaviors using classic social science experiments. CoBRA has two components: (1) Cognitive Bias Index that measures the cognitive bias of a social agent, by quantifying the agent's reactions in a set of validated classical social science experiments; (2) Behavioral Regulation Engine that aligns the agent's behavior to demonstrate controlled cognitive bias. We evaluated CoBRA as an HCI toolkit through demonstration and technical benchmarks. Our results suggest that CoBRA can precisely program the cognitive bias demonstrated in a social agent in a model-agnostic manner.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Pipelines: A Survey of the Paradigm Shift toward Model-Native Agentic AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16720v1)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid evolution of agentic AI marks a new phase in artificial intelligence, where Large Language Models (LLMs) no longer merely respond but act, reason, and adapt. This survey traces the paradigm shift in building agentic AI: from Pipeline-based systems, where planning, tool use, and memory are orchestrated by external logic, to the emerging Model-native paradigm, where these capabilities are internalized within the model's parameters. We first position Reinforcement Learning (RL) as the algorithmic engine enabling this paradigm shift. By reframing learning from imitating static data to outcome-driven exploration, RL underpins a unified solution of LLM + RL + Task across language, vision and embodied domains. Building on this, the survey systematically reviews how each capability -- Planning, Tool use, and Memory -- has evolved from externally scripted modules to end-to-end learned behaviors. Furthermore, it examines how this paradigm shift has reshaped major agent applications, specifically the Deep Research agent emphasizing long-horizon reasoning and the GUI agent emphasizing embodied interaction. We conclude by discussing the continued internalization of agentic capabilities like Multi-agent collaboration and Reflection, alongside the evolving roles of the system and model layers in future agentic AI. Together, these developments outline a coherent trajectory toward model-native agentic AI as an integrated learning and interaction framework, marking the transition from constructing systems that apply intelligence to developing models that grow intelligence through experience.</p></details> |  |
| **[DualTune: Decoupled Fine-Tuning for On-Device Agentic Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00229v2)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) as agentic orchestrators has revolutionized task automation, but the need for privacy-preserving, cost-effective solutions demands on-device inference capabilities. However, local LLMs consistently underperform compared to frontier models in tool calling scenarios, struggling with both tool selection from large tool sets and accurate argument generation for complex parameter structures. We introduce a methodology that disaggregates a tool-calling task into two distinct subtasks: tool selection and argument generation. We propose "decoupled fine-tuning", a novel post-training approach that employs LoRA fine-tuning to create dedicated LoRA adapters for tool selection and tool-specific argument generation using separate loss masking for each of the subtasks. Furthermore, we present DualTune, an inference framework that leverages the LoRA adapters created using decoupled fine-tuning to perform efficient agent orchestration with the help of local models on end-user devices. DualTune decomposes the tool-call generation step into tool selection and argument generation, and dynamically loads the corresponding LoRA adapters to generate tool calls. Additionally, DualTune implements hierarchical orchestration to restrict the number of tools required for tool selection. Our experiments on the MCP-Bench benchmark demonstrate that the Qwen-2.5-7B model trained using decoupled fine-tuning improves the tool calling accuracy of the base model by 46%, and outperforms other local reasoning, non-reasoning and fine-tuned models of similar size in all cases, and models that are 2x larger, in most cases.</p></details> |  |
| **[AgentAuditor: Human-Level Safety and Security Evaluation for LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00641v2)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the rapid advancement of LLM-based agents, the reliable evaluation of their safety and security remains a significant challenge. Existing rule-based or LLM-based evaluators often miss dangers in agents' step-by-step actions, overlook subtle meanings, fail to see how small issues compound, and get confused by unclear safety or security rules. To overcome this evaluation crisis, we introduce AgentAuditor, a universal, training-free, memory-augmented reasoning framework that empowers LLM evaluators to emulate human expert evaluators. AgentAuditor constructs an experiential memory by having an LLM adaptively extract structured semantic features (e.g., scenario, risk, behavior) and generate associated chain-of-thought reasoning traces for past interactions. A multi-stage, context-aware retrieval-augmented generation process then dynamically retrieves the most relevant reasoning experiences to guide the LLM evaluator's assessment of new cases. Moreover, we developed ASSEBench, the first benchmark designed to check how well LLM-based evaluators can spot both safety risks and security threats. ASSEBench comprises 2293 meticulously annotated interaction records, covering 15 risk types across 29 application scenarios. A key feature of ASSEBench is its nuanced approach to ambiguous risk situations, employing "Strict" and "Lenient" judgment standards. Experiments demonstrate that AgentAuditor not only consistently improves the evaluation performance of LLMs across all benchmarks but also sets a new state-of-the-art in LLM-as-a-judge for agent safety and security, achieving human-level accuracy.

| **[A Vision for Access Control in LLM-based Agent Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11108v2)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The autonomy and contextual complexity of LLM-based agents render traditional access control (AC) mechanisms insufficient. Static, rule-based systems designed for predictable environments are fundamentally ill-equipped to manage the dynamic information flows inherent in agentic interactions. This position paper argues for a paradigm shift from binary access control to a more sophisticated model of information governance, positing that the core challenge is not merely about permission, but about governing the flow of information. We introduce Agent Access Control (AAC), a novel framework that reframes AC as a dynamic, context-aware process of information flow governance. AAC operates on two core modules: (1) multi-dimensional contextual evaluation, which assesses not just identity but also relationships, scenarios, and norms; and (2) adaptive response formulation, which moves beyond simple allow/deny decisions to shape information through redaction, summarization, and paraphrasing. This vision, powered by a dedicated AC reasoning engine, aims to bridge the gap between human-like nuanced judgment and scalable Al safety, proposing a new conceptual lens for future research in trustworthy agent design.</p></details> | 11 pages, 1 figure |
| **[An Agentic Framework with LLMs for Solving Complex Vehicle Routing Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16701v1)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Complex vehicle routing problems (VRPs) remain a fundamental challenge, demanding substantial expert effort for intent interpretation and algorithm design. While large language models (LLMs) offer a promising path toward automation, current approaches still rely on external intervention, which restrict autonomy and often lead to execution errors and low solution feasibility. To address these challenges, we propose an Agentic Framework with LLMs (AFL) for solving complex vehicle routing problems, achieving full automation from problem instance to solution. AFL directly extracts knowledge from raw inputs and enables self-contained code generation without handcrafted modules or external solvers. To improve trustworthiness, AFL decomposes the overall pipeline into three manageable subtasks and employs four specialized agents whose coordinated interactions enforce cross-functional consistency and logical soundness. Extensive experiments on 60 complex VRPs, ranging from standard benchmarks to practical variants, validate the effectiveness and generality of our framework, showing comparable performance against meticulously designed algorithms. Notably, it substantially outperforms existing LLM-based baselines in both code reliability and solution feasibility, achieving rates close to 100% on the evaluated benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

Our work is the first to focus on cooperative navigation without individual reference targets for the robots, using a single target for the formation's centroid. This eliminates the complexities involved in having several path planners to control a team of robots. To ensure safety, our MARL framework uses model predictive control (MPC) to prevent actions that could lead to collisions during training and execution. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in simulation and on real robots, achieving safe behavior-based cooperative navigation without using individual reference targets, with zero collisions, and faster target reaching compared to baselines. Finally, we study the impact of MPC safety filters on the learning process, revealing that we achieve faster convergence during training and we show that our approach can be safely deployed on real robots, even during early stages of the training.</p></details> |  |

These agents often face heterogeneities in objectives, evaluation budgets, and accessible design variables, which complicates coordination and can lead to redundancy, poor resource use, and ineffective information sharing. Bayesian Optimization (BO) is a widely used decision-making framework for expensive black box functions, but its single-agent formulation assumes centralized control and full data sharing. Recent collaborative BO methods relax these assumptions, yet they often require uniform resources, fully shared input spaces, and fixed task alignment, conditions rarely satisfied in practice. To address these challenges, we introduce Adaptive Resource Aware Collaborative Bayesian Optimization (ARCO-BO), a framework that explicitly accounts for heterogeneity in multi-agent optimization. ARCO-BO combines three components: a similarity and optima-aware consensus mechanism for adaptive information sharing, a budget-aware asynchronous sampling strategy for resource coordination, and a partial input space sharing for heterogeneous design spaces. Experiments on synthetic and high-dimensional engineering problems show that ARCO-BO consistently outperforms independent BO and existing collaborative BO via consensus approach, achieving robust and efficient performance in complex multi-agent settings.</p></details> |  |

However, such fixed schemes often suffer from two key limitations. First, they cannot handle the imbalance in node informativeness -- some nodes are rich in information, while others remain sparse. Second, predefined message passing primarily leverages local structural similarity while ignoring global semantic relationships across the graph, limiting the model's ability to capture distant but relevant information. We propose Retrieval-augmented Graph Agentic Network (ReaGAN), an agent-based framework that empowers each node with autonomous, node-level decision-making. Each node acts as an agent that independently plans its next action based on its internal memory, enabling node-level planning and adaptive message propagation. Additionally, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) allows nodes to access semantically relevant content and build global relationships in the graph. ReaGAN achieves competitive performance under few-shot in-context settings using a frozen LLM backbone without fine-tuning, showcasing the potential of agentic planning and local-global retrieval in graph learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, work in progress</p></details> |
| **[Unleashing Diverse Thinking Modes in LLMs through Multi-Agent Collaboration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16645v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong performance but often lack interpretable reasoning. This paper introduces the Multi-Agent Collaboration Framework for Diverse Thinking Modes (DiMo), which enhances both performance and interpretability by simulating a structured debate among four specialized LLM agents. Each agent embodies a distinct reasoning paradigm, allowing the framework to collaboratively explore diverse cognitive approaches. Through iterative debate, agents challenge and refine initial responses, yielding more robust conclusions and an explicit, auditable reasoning chain. Across six benchmarks and under a unified open-source setup, DiMo improves accuracy over widely used single-model and debate baselines, with the largest gains on math. We position DiMo as a semantics-aware, Web-native multi-agent framework: it models human-machine intelligence with LLM agents that produce semantically typed, URL-annotated evidence chains for explanations and user-friendly interactions. Although our experiments use standard reasoning benchmarks, the framework is designed to be instantiated over Web corpora and knowledge graphs, combining retrieval-augmented reasoning with structured justifications that downstream systems can inspect and reuse.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prompt Optimization via Retrieved Reasoning Assets and Multi-Agent Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16635v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompt optimization has emerged as an effective alternative to retraining for improving the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, most existing approaches treat evaluation as a black box, relying solely on numerical scores while offering limited insight into why a prompt succeeds or fails. They also depend heavily on trial-and-error refinements, which are difficult to interpret and control. In this paper, we introduce MA-SAPO, a Multi-Agent framework for Score-Aware Prompt Optimization. Compared to prior methods, MA-SAPO explicitly couples evaluation outcomes with structured reasoning to guide systematic edits. The framework specifically consists of two stages: during the Reasoning Phase, agents collaboratively explain metric scores, diagnose weaknesses, and synthesize targeted refinements that are stored as reusable reasoning assets; during the Test Phase, agents retrieve these assets to analyze optimized prompts and apply only evidence-grounded edits. By turning evaluation signals into interpretable reasoning chains, MA-SAPO produces prompt refinements that are more transparent, auditable, and controllable. Experiments on the HelpSteer1/2 benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements over single-pass prompting, retrieval-augmented baselines, and prior multi-agent strategies, validating the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> | Preprint |

With llm now powering multi-agent systems and social simulations, we are witnessing new possibilities for modeling open-ended, ever-changing environments. Yet, most current simulations remain constrained within static sandboxes, characterized by predefined tasks, limited dynamics, and rigid evaluation criteria. These limitations prevent them from capturing the complexity of real-world societies. In this paper, we argue that static, task-specific benchmarks are fundamentally inadequate and must be rethought. We critically review emerging architectures that blend llm with multi-agent dynamics, highlight key hurdles such as balancing stability and diversity, evaluating unexpected behaviors, and scaling to greater complexity, and introduce a fresh taxonomy for this rapidly evolving field. Finally, we present a research roadmap centered on open-endedness, continuous co-evolution, and the development of resilient, socially aligned AI ecosystems. We call on the community to move beyond static paradigms and help shape the next generation of adaptive, socially-aware multi-agent simulations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unlocking LLM Repair Capabilities Through Cross-Language Translation and Multi-Agent Refinement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22512v4)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in leveraging LLMs for APR have demonstrated impressive capabilities in fixing software defects. However, current LLM-based approaches predominantly focus on mainstream programming languages like Java and Python, neglecting less prevalent but emerging languages such as Rust due to expensive training resources, limited datasets, and insufficient community support. This narrow focus creates a significant gap in repair capabilities across the programming language spectrum, where the full potential of LLMs for comprehensive multilingual program repair remains largely unexplored. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel cross-language program repair approach LANTERN that leverages LLMs' differential proficiency across languages through a multi-agent iterative repair paradigm. Our technique strategically translates defective code from languages where LLMs exhibit weaker repair capabilities to languages where they demonstrate stronger performance, without requiring additional training. A key innovation of our approach is an LLM-based decision-making system that dynamically selects optimal target languages based on bug characteristics and continuously incorporates feedback from previous repair attempts. We evaluate our method on xCodeEval, a comprehensive multilingual benchmark comprising 5,068 bugs across 11 programming languages. Results demonstrate significant enhancement in repair effectiveness, particularly for underrepresented languages, with Rust showing a 22.09% improvement in Pass@10 metrics. Our research provides the first empirical evidence that cross-language translation significantly expands the repair capabilities of LLMs and effectively bridges the performance gap between programming languages with different levels of popularity, opening new avenues for truly language-agnostic automated program repair.</p></details> |  |
| **[Ripple Effect Protocol: Coordinating Agent Populations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16572v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern AI agents can exchange messages using protocols such as A2A and ACP, yet these mechanisms emphasize communication over coordination. As agent populations grow, this limitation produces brittle collective behavior, where individually smart agents converge on poor group outcomes. We introduce the Ripple Effect Protocol (REP), a coordination protocol in which agents share not only their decisions but also lightweight sensitivities - signals expressing how their choices would change if key environmental variables shifted. These sensitivities ripple through local networks, enabling groups to align faster and more stably than with agent-centric communication alone. We formalize REP's protocol specification, separating required message schemas from optional aggregation rules, and evaluate it across scenarios with varying incentives and network topologies. Benchmarks across three domains: (i) supply chain cascades (Beer Game), (ii) preference aggregation in sparse networks (Movie Scheduling), and (iii) sustainable resource allocation (Fishbanks) show that REP improves coordination accuracy and efficiency over A2A by 41 to 100%, while flexibly handling multimodal sensitivity signals from LLMs. By making coordination a protocol-level capability, REP provides scalable infrastructure for the emerging Internet of Agents</p></details> |  |
| **[Automated Composition of Agents: A Knapsack Approach for Agentic Component Selection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16499v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Designing effective agentic systems requires the seamless composition and integration of agents, tools, and models within dynamic and uncertain environments. Most existing methods rely on static, semantic retrieval approaches for tool or agent discovery. However, effective reuse and composition of existing components remain challenging due to incomplete capability descriptions and the limitations of retrieval methods. Component selection suffers because the decisions are not based on capability, cost, and real-time utility. To address these challenges, we introduce a structured, automated framework for agentic system composition that is inspired by the knapsack problem. Our framework enables a composer agent to systematically identify, select, and assemble an optimal set of agentic components by jointly considering performance, budget constraints, and compatibility. By dynamically testing candidate components and modeling their utility in real-time, our approach streamlines the assembly of agentic systems and facilitates scalable reuse of resources. Empirical evaluation with Claude 3.5 Sonnet across five benchmarking datasets shows that our online-knapsack-based composer consistently lies on the Pareto frontier, achieving higher success rates at significantly lower component costs compared to our baselines. In the single-agent setup, the online knapsack composer shows a success rate improvement of up to 31.6% in comparison to the retrieval baselines. In multi-agent systems, the online knapsack composer increases success rate from 37% to 87% when agents are selected from an agent inventory of 100+ agents. The substantial performance gap confirms the robust adaptability of our method across diverse domains and budget constraints.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025 Conference</p></details> |

While uncertainty quantification is well-studied for single-turn tasks, multi-turn agentic scenarios with real-world tool access present unique challenges where uncertainties and ambiguities compound, leading to severe or catastrophic risks beyond traditional text generation failures. We propose using "quitting" as a simple yet effective behavioral mechanism for LLM agents to recognize and withdraw from situations where they lack confidence. Leveraging the ToolEmu framework, we conduct a systematic evaluation of quitting behavior across 12 state-of-the-art LLMs. Our results demonstrate a highly favorable safety-helpfulness trade-off: agents prompted to quit with explicit instructions improve safety by an average of +0.39 on a 0-3 scale across all models (+0.64 for proprietary models), while maintaining a negligible average decrease of -0.03 in helpfulness. Our analysis demonstrates that simply adding explicit quit instructions proves to be a highly effective safety mechanism that can immediately be deployed in existing agent systems, and establishes quitting as an effective first-line defense mechanism for autonomous agents in high-stakes applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Relia...</summary><p>Reliable ML and Regulatable ML workshops, Neurips 2025</p></details> |

To bridge the gaps, we present macOSWorld, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating GUI agents on macOS. macOSWorld features 202 multilingual interactive tasks across 30 applications (28 macOS-exclusive), with task instructions and OS interfaces offered in 5 languages (English, Chinese, Arabic, Japanese, and Russian). As GUI agents are shown to be vulnerable to deception attacks, macOSWorld also includes a dedicated safety benchmarking subset. Our evaluation on six GUI agents reveals a dramatic gap: proprietary computer-use agents lead at above 30% success rate, while open-source lightweight research models lag at below 5\%, highlighting the need for macOS domain adaptation. Multilingual benchmarks also expose common weaknesses, especially in Arabic, with a 28.8% average degradation compared to English. Results from safety benchmarking also highlight that deception attacks are more general and demand immediate attention. Project page: https://macos-world.github.io.</p></details> |  |
| **[REALM: An MLLM-Agent Framework for Open World 3D Reasoning Segmentation and Editing on Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16410v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bridging the gap between complex human instructions and precise 3D object grounding remains a significant challenge in vision and robotics. Existing 3D segmentation methods often struggle to interpret ambiguous, reasoning-based instructions, while 2D vision-language models that excel at such reasoning lack intrinsic 3D spatial understanding. In this paper, we introduce REALM, an innovative MLLM-agent framework that enables open-world reasoning-based segmentation without requiring extensive 3D-specific post-training. We perform segmentation directly on 3D Gaussian Splatting representations, capitalizing on their ability to render photorealistic novel views that are highly suitable for MLLM comprehension. As directly feeding one or more rendered views to the MLLM can lead to high sensitivity to viewpoint selection, we propose a novel Global-to-Local Spatial Grounding strategy. Specifically, multiple global views are first fed into the MLLM agent in parallel for coarse-level localization, aggregating responses to robustly identify the target object. Then, several close-up novel views of the object are synthesized to perform fine-grained local segmentation, yielding accurate and consistent 3D masks. Extensive experiments show that REALM achieves remarkable performance in interpreting both explicit and implicit instructions across LERF, 3D-OVS, and our newly introduced REALM3D benchmarks. Furthermore, our agent framework seamlessly supports a range of 3D interaction tasks, including object removal, replacement, and style transfer, demonstrating its practical utility and versatility.

Currently, the existing solutions to this predicament, such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and explicit memory systems, primarily focus on fact-level storage and retrieval, lacking the capability to distill latent preferences and deep traits from the multi-turn dialogues, which limits the long-term and effective user modeling, directly leading to the personalized interactions remaining shallow, and hindering the cross-session continuity. To realize the long-term memory and behavioral consistency for Language Agents in LLM era, we propose a self-evolving memory framework RGMem, inspired by the ideology of classic renormalization group (RG) in physics, this framework enables to organize the dialogue history in multiple scales: it first extracts semantics and user insights from episodic fragments, then through hierarchical coarse-graining and rescaling operations, progressively forms a dynamically-evolved user profile. The core innovation of our work lies in modeling memory evolution as a multi-scale process of information compression and emergence, which accomplishes the high-level and accurate user profiles from noisy and microscopic-level interactions.</p></details> | 11 pages,3 figures |

To address these challenges, we introduce a generic neuro-symbolic approach, which we call Autonomous Trustworthy Agents (ATA). The core of our approach lies in decoupling tasks into two distinct phases: Offline knowledge ingestion and online task processing. During knowledge ingestion, an LLM translates an informal problem specification into a formal, symbolic knowledge base. This formal representation is crucial as it can be verified and refined by human experts, ensuring its correctness and alignment with domain requirements. In the subsequent task processing phase, each incoming input is encoded into the same formal language. A symbolic decision engine then utilizes this encoded input in conjunction with the formal knowledge base to derive a reliable result. Through an extensive evaluation on a complex reasoning task, we demonstrate that a concrete implementation of ATA is competitive with state-of-the-art end-to-end reasoning models in a fully automated setup while maintaining trustworthiness. Crucially, with a human-verified and corrected knowledge base, our approach significantly outperforms even larger models, while exhibiting perfect determinism, enhanced stability against input perturbations, and inherent immunity to prompt injection attacks. By generating decisions grounded in symbolic reasoning, ATA offers a practical and controllable architecture for building the next generation of transparent, auditable, and reliable autonomous agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[Integrating LLM and Diffusion-Based Agents for Social Simulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16366v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agent-based social simulation provides a valuable methodology for predicting social information diffusion, yet existing approaches face two primary limitations. Traditional agent models often rely on rigid behavioral rules and lack semantic understanding of textual content, while emerging large language model (LLM)-based agents incur prohibitive computational costs at scale. To address these challenges, we propose a hybrid simulation framework that strategically integrates LLM-driven agents with diffusion model-based agents. The framework employs LLM-based agents to simulate a core subset of users with rich semantic reasoning, while a diffusion model handles the remaining population efficiently. Although the two agent types operate on disjoint user groups, both incorporate key factors including user personalization, social influence, and content awareness, and interact through a coordinated simulation process. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that our framework outperforms existing methods in prediction accuracy, validating the effectiveness of its modular design.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 3 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

This survey presents a comprehensive, data-centric synthesis that reframes the development of Sci-LLMs as a co-evolution between models and their underlying data substrate. We formulate a unified taxonomy of scientific data and a hierarchical model of scientific knowledge, emphasizing the multimodal, cross-scale, and domain-specific challenges that differentiate scientific corpora from general natural language processing datasets. We systematically review recent Sci-LLMs, from general-purpose foundations to specialized models across diverse scientific disciplines, alongside an extensive analysis of over 270 pre-/post-training datasets, showing why Sci-LLMs pose distinct demands -- heterogeneous, multi-scale, uncertainty-laden corpora that require representations preserving domain invariance and enabling cross-modal reasoning. On evaluation, we examine over 190 benchmark datasets and trace a shift from static exams toward process- and discovery-oriented assessments with advanced evaluation protocols. These data-centric analyses highlight persistent issues in scientific data development and discuss emerging solutions involving semi-automated annotation pipelines and expert validation. Finally, we outline a paradigm shift toward closed-loop systems where autonomous agents based on Sci-LLMs actively experiment, validate, and contribute to a living, evolving knowledge base. Collectively, this work provides a roadmap for building trustworthy, continually evolving artificial intelligence (AI) systems that function as a true partner in accelerating scientific discovery.</p></details> |  |
| **[Customer-R1: Personalized Simulation of Human Behaviors via RL-based LLM Agent in Online Shopping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07230v2)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simulating step-wise human behavior with Large Language Models (LLMs) has become an emerging research direction, enabling applications in various practical domains. While prior methods, including prompting, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and reinforcement learning (RL), have shown promise in modeling step-wise behavior, they primarily learn a population-level policy without conditioning on a user's persona, yielding generic rather than personalized simulations. In this work, we pose a critical question: how can LLM agents better simulate personalized user behavior? We introduce Customer-R1, an RL-based method for personalized, step-wise user behavior simulation in online shopping environments. Our policy is conditioned on an explicit persona, and we optimize next-step rationale and action generation via action correctness reward signals. Experiments on the OPeRA dataset emonstrate that Customer-R1 not only significantly outperforms prompting and SFT-based baselines in next-action prediction tasks, but also better matches users' action distribution, indicating higher fidelity in personalized behavior simulation.</p></details> |  |
| **[What Limits Agentic Systems Efficiency?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16276v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs), such as OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1, have demonstrated strong reasoning capabilities. To further enhance LLM capabilities, recent agentic systems, such as Deep Research, incorporate web interactions into LLM reasoning to mitigate uncertainties and reduce potential errors. However, existing research predominantly focuses on reasoning performance, often neglecting the efficiency of agentic systems. In this work, we present a comprehensive empirical study that identifies efficiency bottlenecks in web-interactive agentic systems. We decompose end-to-end latency into two primary components: LLM API latency and web environment latency. We conduct a comprehensive empirical study across 15 models and 5 providers to demonstrate high variability in API-based agentic systems. We observe that web environment latency can contribute as much as 53.7% to the overall latency in a web-based agentic system. To improve latency, we propose SpecCache, a caching framework augmented with speculative execution that can reduce web environment overhead. Extensive evaluations on two standard benchmarks show that our approach improves the cache hit rate by up to 58x compared to a random caching strategy, while reducing web environment overhead by up to 3.2x, without degrading agentic system performance.</p></details> | 27 pages, 15 figures |
| **[Agentic System with Modal Logic for Autonomous Diagnostics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11943v3)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of intelligent agents, particularly those powered by language models (LMs), has shown a critical role in various environments that require intelligent and autonomous decision-making. Environments are not passive testing grounds, and they represent the data required for agents to learn and exhibit in very challenging conditions that require adaptive, complex, and autonomous capacity to make decisions. While the paradigm of scaling models and datasets has led to remarkable emergent capabilities, we argue that scaling the structure, fidelity, and logical consistency of agent reasoning within these environments is a crucial, yet underexplored, dimension of AI research. This paper introduces a neuro-symbolic multi-agent architecture where the belief states of individual agents are formally represented as Kripke models. This foundational choice enables them to reason about known concepts of \emph{possibility} and \emph{necessity} using the formal language of modal logic. In this work, we use immutable, domain-specific knowledge to make an informed root cause diagnosis, which is encoded as logical constraints essential for proper, reliable, and explainable diagnosis. In the proposed model, we show constraints that actively guide the hypothesis generation of LMs, effectively preventing them from reaching physically or logically untenable conclusions. In a high-fidelity simulated particle accelerator environment, our system successfully diagnoses complex, cascading failures by combining the powerful semantic intuition of LMs with the rigorous, verifiable validation of modal logic and a factual world model and showcasing a viable path toward more robust, reliable, and verifiable autonomous agents.</p></details> | 10 pages, 1 figure |

This challenge is exacerbated by a fragmented data landscape that impedes reproducible research and the development of generalist models. To address these limitations, we introduce \textbf{NEBULA}, a unified ecosystem for single-arm manipulation that enables diagnostic and reproducible evaluation. NEBULA features a novel dual-axis evaluation protocol that combines fine-grained \textit{capability tests} for precise skill diagnosis with systematic \textit{stress tests} that measure robustness. A standardized API and a large-scale, aggregated dataset are provided to reduce fragmentation and support cross-dataset training and fair comparison. Using NEBULA, we demonstrate that top-performing VLAs struggle with key capabilities such as spatial reasoning and dynamic adaptation, which are consistently obscured by conventional end-task success metrics. By measuring both what an agent can do and when it does so reliably, NEBULA provides a practical foundation for robust, general-purpose embodied agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>Homep...</summary><p>Homepage: https://vulab-ai.github.io/NEBULA-Alpha/</p></details> |
| **[Detecting Adversarial Fine-tuning with Auditing Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16255v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM) providers expose fine-tuning APIs that let end users fine-tune their frontier LLMs. Unfortunately, it has been shown that an adversary with fine-tuning access to an LLM can bypass safeguards. Particularly concerning, such attacks may avoid detection with datasets that are only implicitly harmful. Our work studies robust detection mechanisms for adversarial use of fine-tuning APIs. We introduce the concept of a fine-tuning auditing agent and show it can detect harmful fine-tuning prior to model deployment. We provide our auditing agent with access to the fine-tuning dataset, as well as the fine-tuned and pre-fine-tuned models, and request the agent assigns a risk score for the fine-tuning job. We evaluate our detection approach on a diverse set of eight strong fine-tuning attacks from the literature, along with five benign fine-tuned models, totaling over 1400 independent audits. These attacks are undetectable with basic content moderation on the dataset, highlighting the challenge of the task. With the best set of affordances, our auditing agent achieves a 56.2% detection rate of adversarial fine-tuning at a 1% false positive rate. Most promising, the auditor is able to detect covert cipher attacks that evade safety evaluations and content moderation of the dataset. While benign fine-tuning with unintentional subtle safety degradation remains a challenge, we establish a baseline configuration for further work in this area. We release our auditing agent at https://github.com/safety-research/finetuning-auditor.</p></details> |  |

Existing environments tend to have one or more of the following issues: they overwhelm policy models with excessive and noisy context; they perform actions non-deterministically without waiting for the UI or network to stabilize; or they cannot scale isolated client-server containers effectively for parallel RL rollouts. We propose WEBSERV, an environment that includes 1) a compact, site-agnostic browser environment that balances context and action complexity, and 2) a scalable RL environment via efficient launching and resetting web-servers to enable scalable RL training and evaluation. We evaluate WEBSERV on the shopping CMS and Gitlab tasks in WebArena, achieving state-of-the-art single-prompt success rates while cutting launch latency by ~5x and storage need by ~240x, with a comparable memory footprint, enabling 200+ concurrent containers on a single host.</p></details> |  |

We study a multi-agent task assignment problem where a central planner assigns recurring tasks to multiple members of a team over a finite time horizon. For any given task, the members have heterogeneous capabilities in terms of task completion times, task resource consumption (which can model variables such as energy or attention), and preferences in terms of the rewards they collect upon task completion. We assume that the reward, execution time, and resource consumption for each member to complete any task are stochastic with unknown distributions. The goal of the planner is to maximize the total expected reward that the team receives over the problem horizon while ensuring that the resource consumption required for any assigned task is within the capability of the agent. We propose and analyze a bandit algorithm for this problem. Since the bandit algorithm relies on solving an optimal task assignment problem repeatedly, we analyze the achievable regret in two cases: when we can solve the optimal task assignment exactly and when we can solve it only approximately.</p></details> | 14 pages |

Existing defenses often fall short due to reactive designs or centralized architectures which may introduce single points of failure. To address these challenges, we propose SentinelNet, the first decentralized framework for proactively detecting and mitigating malicious behaviors in multi-agent collaboration. SentinelNet equips each agent with a credit-based detector trained via contrastive learning on augmented adversarial debate trajectories, enabling autonomous evaluation of message credibility and dynamic neighbor ranking via bottom-k elimination to suppress malicious communications. To overcome the scarcity of attack data, it generates adversarial trajectories simulating diverse threats, ensuring robust training. Experiments on MAS benchmarks show SentinelNet achieves near-perfect detection of malicious agents, close to 100% within two debate rounds, and recovers 95% of system accuracy from compromised baselines. By exhibiting strong generalizability across domains and attack patterns, SentinelNet establishes a novel paradigm for safeguarding collaborative MAS.</p></details> |  |

We present TEAM-PHI, a multi-agent evaluation and selection framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to automatically measure de-identification quality and select the best-performing model without heavy reliance on gold labels. TEAM-PHI deploys multiple Evaluation Agents, each independently judging the correctness of PHI extractions and outputting structured metrics. Their results are then consolidated through an LLM-based majority voting mechanism that integrates diverse evaluator perspectives into a single, stable, and reproducible ranking. Experiments on a real-world clinical note corpus demonstrate that TEAM-PHI produces consistent and accurate rankings: despite variation across individual evaluators, LLM-based voting reliably converges on the same top-performing systems. Further comparison with ground-truth annotations and human evaluation confirms that the framework's automated rankings closely match supervised evaluation. By combining independent evaluation agents with LLM majority voting, TEAM-PHI offers a practical, secure, and cost-effective solution for automatic evaluation and best-model selection in PHI de-identification, even when ground-truth labels are limited.</p></details> | <details><summary>Agent...</summary><p>Agents4Science 2025 (Spotlight)</p></details> |

However, most LLMs are pretrained independently and not specifically optimized for coordination. Existing LLM fine-tuning frameworks rely on individual rewards, which require complex reward designs for each agent to encourage collaboration. To address these challenges, we model LLM collaboration as a cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) problem. We develop a multi-agent, multi-turn algorithm, Multi-Agent Group Relative Policy Optimization (MAGRPO), to solve it, building on current RL approaches for LLMs as well as MARL techniques. Our experiments on LLM writing and coding collaboration demonstrate that fine-tuning MAS with MAGRPO enables agents to generate high-quality responses efficiently through effective cooperation. Our approach opens the door to using other MARL methods for LLMs and highlights the associated challenges.</p></details> |  |

Existing audits are dominated by heuristics that lack theoretical guarantees, struggle to transfer across tasks, and seldom ship with the infrastructure needed for independent replication. We introduce Audit the Whisper, a conference-grade research artifact that spans theory, benchmark design, detection, and reproducibility. Our contributions are: (i) a channel-capacity analysis showing how interventions such as paraphrase, rate limiting, and role permutation impose quantifiable capacity penalties-operationalised via paired-run Kullback--Leibler diagnostics-that tighten mutual-information thresholds with finite-sample guarantees and full proofs; (ii) ColludeBench-v0, covering pricing, first-price auctions, peer review, and hosted Gemini/Groq APIs with configurable covert schemes, deterministic manifests, and reward instrumentation; and (iii) a calibrated auditing pipeline that fuses cross-run mutual information, permutation invariance, watermark variance, and fairness-aware acceptance bias, each tuned to a $10^{-3}$ false-positive budget and validated by 10k honest runs plus an e-value martingale. Across ColludeBench and external suites including Secret Collusion, CASE, Perfect Collusion Benchmark, and SentinelAgent, the union meta-test attains state-of-the-art power at fixed FPR while ablations surface price-of-auditing trade-offs and fairness-driven colluders invisible to MI alone. We release regeneration scripts, anonymized manifests, and documentation so that external auditors can reproduce every figure, satisfy double-blind requirements, and extend the framework with minimal effort.</p></details> | 13 pages, 0 figures |

However, the monolithic text from methods like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prevents this, as current interfaces lack real-time verbalization and robust user barge-in.

This design allows narration and inference to run in parallel, empowering users to interrupt, query, and steer the model's reasoning process at any time. Objective benchmarks show this approach reduces interaction latency by more than 600x compared to monolithic baselines while ensuring high fidelity and competitive task accuracy.

Traditional O-RAN control loops rely heavily on RIC- based orchestration, which centralizes intelligence and exposes the system to risks such as policy conflicts, data drift, and unsafe actions under unforeseen conditions. In this work, we argue that the future of autonomous networks lies in a multi-agentic architecture, where specialized agents collaborate to perform data collection, model training, prediction, policy generation, verification, deployment, and assurance. By replacing tightly- coupled centralized RIC-based workflows with distributed agents, the framework achieves autonomy, resilience, explainability, and system-wide safety. To substantiate this vision, we design and evaluate a traffic steering use case under surge and drift conditions. Results across four KPIs: RRC connected users, IP throughput, PRB utilization, and SINR, demonstrate that a naive predictor-driven deployment improves local KPIs but destabilizes neighbors, whereas the agentic system blocks unsafe policies, preserving global network health. This study highlights multi- agent architectures as a credible foundation for trustworthy AI- driven autonomy in next-generation RANs.</p></details> |  |

Existing test-time optimization methods, successful in other domains, struggle with the multi-faceted nature of video. In this work, we introduce VISTA (Video Iterative Self-improvemenT Agent), a novel multi-agent system that autonomously improves video generation through refining prompts in an iterative loop. VISTA first decomposes a user idea into a structured temporal plan. After generation, the best video is identified through a robust pairwise tournament. This winning video is then critiqued by a trio of specialized agents focusing on visual, audio, and contextual fidelity. Finally, a reasoning agent synthesizes this feedback to introspectively rewrite and enhance the prompt for the next generation cycle. Experiments on single- and multi-scene video generation scenarios show that while prior methods yield inconsistent gains, VISTA consistently improves video quality and alignment with user intent, achieving up to 60% pairwise win rate against state-of-the-art baselines. Human evaluators concur, preferring VISTA outputs in 66.4% of comparisons.</p></details> |  |

Traditional in-person therapy fails to meet this demand, and the situation is worsened by stigma. While general-purpose large language models (LLMs) offer efficiency for AI-driven mental health solutions, they underperform because they lack specialized fine-tuning. Existing LLM-based mental health chatbots can engage in empathetic conversations, but they overlook real-time user mental state assessment which is critical for professional counseling. This paper proposes MoPHES, a framework that integrates mental state evaluation, conversational support, and professional treatment recommendations. The agent developed under this framework uses two fine-tuned MiniCPM4-0.5B LLMs: one is fine-tuned on mental health conditions datasets to assess users' mental states and predict the severity of anxiety and depression; the other is fine-tuned on multi-turn dialogues to handle conversations with users. By leveraging insights into users' mental states, our agent provides more tailored support and professional treatment recommendations. Both models are also deployed directly on mobile devices to enhance user convenience and protect user privacy. Additionally, to evaluate the performance of MoPHES with other LLMs, we develop a benchmark for the automatic evaluation of mental state prediction and multi-turn counseling dialogues, which includes comprehensive evaluation metrics, datasets, and methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[Interpretable RNA-Seq Clustering with an LLM-Based Agentic Evidence-Grounded Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16082v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose CITE V.1, an agentic, evidence-grounded framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to provide transparent and reproducible interpretations of RNA-seq clusters. Unlike existing enrichment-based approaches that reduce results to broad statistical associations and LLM-only models that risk unsupported claims or fabricated citations, CITE V.1 transforms cluster interpretation by producing biologically coherent explanations explicitly anchored in the biomedical literature. The framework orchestrates three specialized agents: a Retriever that gathers domain knowledge from PubMed and UniProt, an Interpreter that formulates functional hypotheses, and Critics that evaluate claims, enforce evidence grounding, and qualify uncertainty through confidence and reliability indicators. Applied to Salmonella enterica RNA-seq data, CITE V.1 generated biologically meaningful insights supported by the literature, while an LLM-only Gemini baseline frequently produced speculative results with false citations. By moving RNA-seq analysis from surface-level enrichment to auditable, interpretable, and evidence-based hypothesis generation, CITE V.1 advances the transparency and reliability of AI in biomedicine.</p></details> |  |

However, the effectiveness of search depends on where to search, namely, how to encode the domain prior into an operationally structured hypothesis space. To this end, this paper proposes a compact formal theory that describes and measures LLM-assisted iterative search guided by domain priors. We represent an agent as a fuzzy relation operator on inputs and outputs to capture feasible transitions; the agent is thereby constrained by a fixed safety envelope. To describe multi-step reasoning/search, we weight all reachable paths by a single continuation parameter and sum them to obtain a coverage generating function; this induces a measure of reachability difficulty; and it provides a geometric interpretation of search on the graph induced by the safety envelope. We further provide the simplest testable inferences and validate them via a majority-vote instantiation. This theory offers a workable language and operational tools to measure agents and their search spaces, proposing a systematic formal description of iterative search constructed by LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 2 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

SQuAI addresses key limitations of existing RAG systems in the scholarly domain, where complex, open-domain questions demand accurate answers, explicit claims with citations, and retrieval across millions of scientific documents. Built on over 2.3 million full-text papers from arXiv.org, SQuAI employs four collaborative agents to decompose complex questions into sub-questions, retrieve targeted evidence via hybrid sparse-dense retrieval, and adaptively filter documents to improve contextual relevance. To ensure faithfulness and traceability, SQuAI integrates in-line citations for each generated claim and provides supporting sentences from the source documents. Our system improves faithfulness, answer relevance, and contextual relevance by up to +0.088 (12%) over a strong RAG baseline. We further release a benchmark of 1,000 scientific question-answer-evidence triplets to support reproducibility.

| **[Scaling Multi Agent Reinforcement Learning for Underwater Acoustic Tracking via Autonomous Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08222v2)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous vehicles (AV) offer a cost-effective solution for scientific missions such as underwater tracking. Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful method for controlling AVs in complex marine environments. However, scaling these techniques to a fleet--essential for multi-target tracking or targets with rapid, unpredictable motion--presents significant computational challenges. Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is notoriously sample-inefficient, and while high-fidelity simulators like Gazebo's LRAUV provide 100x faster-than-real-time single-robot simulations, they offer no significant speedup for multi-vehicle scenarios, making MARL training impractical. To address these limitations, we propose an iterative distillation method that transfers high-fidelity simulations into a simplified, GPU-accelerated environment while preserving high-level dynamics. This approach achieves up to a 30,000x speedup over Gazebo through parallelization, enabling efficient training via end-to-end GPU acceleration. Additionally, we introduce a novel Transformer-based architecture (TransfMAPPO) that learns multi-agent policies invariant to the number of agents and targets, significantly improving sample efficiency. Following large-scale curriculum learning conducted entirely on GPU, we perform extensive evaluations in Gazebo, demonstrating that our method maintains tracking errors below 5 meters over extended durations, even in the presence of multiple fast-moving targets. This work bridges the gap between large-scale MARL training and high-fidelity deployment, providing a scalable framework for autonomous fleet control in real-world sea missions.</p></details> |  |
| **[TriAgent: Automated Biomarker Discovery with Deep Research Grounding for Triage in Acute Care by LLM-Based Multi-Agent Collaboration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16080v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Emergency departments worldwide face rising patient volumes, workforce shortages, and variability in triage decisions that threaten the delivery of timely and accurate care. Current triage methods rely primarily on vital signs, routine laboratory values, and clinicians' judgment, which, while effective, often miss emerging biological signals that could improve risk prediction for infection typing or antibiotic administration in acute conditions. To address this challenge, we introduce TriAgent, a large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent framework that couples automated biomarker discovery with deep research for literature-grounded validation and novelty assessment. TriAgent employs a supervisor research agent to generate research topics and delegate targeted queries to specialized sub-agents for evidence retrieval from various data sources. Findings are synthesized to classify biomarkers as either grounded in existing knowledge or flagged as novel candidates, offering transparent justification and highlighting unexplored pathways in acute care risk stratification. Unlike prior frameworks limited to existing routine clinical biomarkers, TriAgent aims to deliver an end-to-end framework from data analysis to literature grounding to improve transparency, explainability and expand the frontier of potentially actionable clinical biomarkers. Given a user's clinical query and quantitative triage data, TriAgent achieved a topic adherence F1 score of 55.7 +/- 5.0%, surpassing the CoT-ReAct agent by over 10%, and a faithfulness score of 0.42 +/- 0.39, exceeding all baselines by more than 50%. Across experiments, TriAgent consistently outperformed state-of-the-art LLM-based agentic frameworks in biomarker justification and literature-grounded novelty assessment.

| **[RL makes MLLMs see better than SFT](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16333v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A dominant assumption in Multimodal Language Model (MLLM) research is that its performance is largely inherited from the LLM backbone, given its immense parameter scale and remarkable capabilities. This has created a void in the understanding of the vision encoder, which determines how MLLMs perceive images. The recent shift in MLLM training paradigms, from Supervised Finetuning (SFT) to Reinforcement Learning (RL), magnifies this oversight-namely, the significant lack of analysis on how such training reshapes the vision encoder as well as the MLLM. To address this, we first investigate the impact of training strategies on MLLMs, where RL shows a clear advantage over SFT in strongly vision-related VQA benchmarks. Motivated by this, we conduct a critical yet under-explored analysis of the vision encoder of MLLMs through diverse and in-depth experiments, ranging from ImageNet classification and segmentation to gradient visualization. Our results demonstrate that MLLM's post-training strategy (i.e., SFT or RL) not only leads to distinct outcomes on MLLM downstream tasks, but also fundamentally reshapes MLLM's underlying visual representations. Specifically, the key finding of our study is that RL produces stronger and precisely localized visual representations compared to SFT, boosting the ability of the vision encoder for MLLM. We then reframe our findings into a simple recipe for building strong vision encoders for MLLMs, Preference-Instructed Vision OpTimization (PIVOT). When integrated into MLLMs, a PIVOT-trained vision encoder outperforms even larger and more heavily-trained counterparts, despite requiring less than 1% of the computational cost of standard vision pretraining. This result opens an effective and efficient path for advancing the vision backbones of MLLMs. Project page available at https://june-page.github.io/pivot/</p></details> |  |

In contrast to the one-dimensional setting, not all countable sofic shifts are countably covered. We investigate the existence of countable covers for gap width shifts, where the number of nonzero symbols in a configuration is bounded by a function of the minimum distance between two such symbols. As our main results, we characterize those one-dimensional gap width shifts whose two-dimensional lift is a countably covered sofic shift, and show that a large class of two-dimensional gap width shifts are countably covered.</p></details> | 38 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Beyond Two-Stage Training: Cooperative SFT and RL for LLM Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06948v2)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven effective in incentivizing the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), but suffers from severe efficiency challenges due to its trial-and-error nature. While the common practice employs supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a warm-up stage for RL, this decoupled two-stage approach suffers from catastrophic forgetting: second-stage RL gradually loses SFT-acquired behaviors and inefficiently explores new patterns. This study introduces a novel method for learning reasoning models that employs bilevel optimization to facilitate better cooperation between these training paradigms. By conditioning the SFT objective on the optimal RL policy, our approach enables SFT to meta-learn how to guide RL's optimization process. During training, the lower level performs RL updates while simultaneously receiving SFT supervision, and the upper level explicitly maximizes the cooperative gain-the performance advantage of joint SFT-RL training over RL alone. Empirical evaluations on five reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms baselines and achieves a better balance between effectiveness and efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Generalization of SFT: A Reinforcement Learning Perspective with Reward Rectification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05629v2)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a simple yet theoretically motivated improvement to Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) for the Large Language Model (LLM), addressing its limited generalization compared to reinforcement learning (RL). Through mathematical analysis, we reveal that standard SFT gradients implicitly encode a problematic reward structure that may severely restrict the generalization capabilities of model. To rectify this, we propose Dynamic Fine-Tuning (DFT), stabilizing gradient updates for each token by dynamically rescaling the objective function with the probability of this token. Remarkably, this single-line code change significantly outperforms standard SFT across multiple challenging benchmarks and base models, demonstrating greatly improved generalization. Additionally, our approach shows competitive results in offline RL settings, offering an effective yet simpler alternative. This work bridges theoretical insight and practical solutions, substantially advancing SFT performance. The code will be available at https://github.com/yongliang-wu/DFT.</p></details> | 14 pages, 3 figures |
| **[RLSR: Reinforcement Learning with Supervised Reward Outperforms SFT in Instruction Following](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14200v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>After the pretraining stage of LLMs, techniques such as SFT, RLHF, RLVR, and RFT are applied to enhance instruction-following ability, mitigate undesired responses, improve reasoning capability and enable efficient domain adaptation with minimal data. SFT relies on the next-token prediction objective to strengthen instruction following in a base model using a large corpus of human-labeled responses. In contrast, RFT employs a RL-based approach to adapt fine-tuned reasoning models to specific domains with limited supervision. Inspired by RFT, we propose replacing SFT with RLSR to leverage the extensive SFT dataset in an RL framework, thereby improving the base model's instruction-following ability. In RLSR, the base model generates multiple responses for each prompt, and reward scores are computed as the cosine similarity in the semantic embedding space between the generated and human-labeled responses. RLSR can be utilized in multiple ways. It can directly replace SFT, achieving superior performance on instruction-following benchmarks-for example, RLSR (SB) on Qwen-7B (INFINITY) achieved an AlpacaEval win rate of 26.34%, surpassing SFT's 21.01%. Furthermore, combining SFT and RLSR further enhances downstream task performance; Qwen-7B (INFINITY) achieved a win rate of 30.73% when trained with SFT + RLSR.</p></details> |  |
| **[Do We Really Need SFT? Prompt-as-Policy over Knowledge Graphs for Cold-start Next POI Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08012v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Next point-of-interest (POI) recommendation is crucial for smart urban services such as tourism, dining, and transportation, yet most approaches struggle under cold-start conditions where user-POI interactions are sparse. Recent efforts leveraging large language models (LLMs) address this challenge through either supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or in-context learning (ICL). However, SFT demands costly annotations and fails to generalize to inactive users, while static prompts in ICL cannot adapt to diverse user contexts. To overcome these limitations, we propose Prompt-as-Policy over knowledge graphs, a reinforcement-guided prompting framework that learns to construct prompts dynamically through contextual bandit optimization. Our method treats prompt construction as a learnable policy that adaptively determines (i) which relational evidences to include, (ii) the number of evidence per candidate, and (iii) their organization and ordering within prompts. More specifically, we construct a knowledge graph (KG) to discover candidates and mine relational paths, which are transformed into evidence cards that summarize rationales for each candidate POI. The frozen LLM then acts as a reasoning engine, generating recommendations from the KG-discovered candidate set based on the policy-optimized prompts. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that Prompt-as-Policy consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving average 7.7\% relative improvements in Acc@1 for inactive users, while maintaining competitive performance on active users, without requiring model fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Empowering Lightweight MLLMs with Reasoning via Long CoT SFT](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03321v2)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards has enhanced the reasoning of large-scale language models (LLMs), its efficacy for lightweight multimodal language models (MLLMs) with fewer than seven billion parameters remains underexplored. This paper investigates the role of long Chain-of-Thought (long CoT) data in enhancing the reasoning abilities of such MLLMs. Our findings demonstrate that Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with long CoT data significantly improves MLLM reasoning. Furthermore, we observe that after this initial SFT phase, MLLMs can achieve additional performance gains through a subsequent RL stage. We conclude that a SFT stage with long CoT data is a critical prerequisite for developing the reasoning capabilities of lightweight MLLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quagmires in SFT-RL Post-Training: When High SFT Scores Mislead and What to Use Instead](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01624v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In post-training for reasoning Large Language Models (LLMs), the current state of practice trains LLMs in two independent stages: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR, shortened as ``RL'' below). In this work, we challenge whether high SFT scores translate to improved performance after RL. We provide extensive counter-examples where this is not true. We find high SFT scores can be biased toward simpler or more homogeneous data and are not reliably predictive of subsequent RL gains or scaled-up post-training effectiveness. In some cases, RL training on models with improved SFT performance could lead to substantially worse outcome compared to RL on the base model without SFT. We study alternative metrics and identify generalization loss on held-out reasoning examples and Pass@large k performance to provide strong proxies for the RL outcome. We trained hundreds of models up to 12B-parameter with SFT and RLVR via GRPO and ran extensive evaluations on 7 math benchmarks with up to 256 repetitions, spending $>$1M GPU hours. Experiments include models from Llama3, Mistral-Nemo, Qwen3 and multiple state-of-the-art SFT/RL datasets. Compared to directly predicting from pre-RL performance, prediction based on generalization loss and Pass@large k achieves substantial higher precision, improving $R^2$ coefficient and Spearman's rank correlation coefficient by up to 0.5 (2x). This provides strong utility for broad use cases. For example, in most experiments, we find SFT training on unique examples for a one epoch underperforms training on half examples for two epochs, either after SFT or SFT-then-RL; With the same SFT budget, training only on short examples may lead to better SFT performance, though, it often leads to worse outcome after RL compared to training on examples with varying lengths. Evaluation tool will be open-sourced.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint. Under Review</p></details> |

We address this practical reliability gap by creating PureTC-1B, a three-stage stabilization pipeline for Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct (an open-weight, instruction-tuned model released by Meta) using parameter-efficient LoRA adapters. Our method combines Continual Pre-Training (CPT) on TC-centric corpora, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with instruction data, and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) using TC-adherence preferences to improve monolingual robustness without full-model retraining. On a benchmark designed to simulate real-world usage, PureTC-1B achieves a 51.3% relative reduction (micro-average) in non-TC output tokens versus the base model. On a Named Entity Translation (NET) task, PureTC-1B further reduces incorrect-language tokens by 77.2% relative to Llama-3B and 57.2% relative to Qwen-1.5B, indicating that robust TC adherence is attainable even at the 1B scale. The pipeline is reproducible, adapter-only, and hardware-friendly, offering practitioners a practical recipe to enhance language stability for TC and potentially other non-English languages.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 1 figures, 2 tables.

| **[Debunk the Myth of SFT Generalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00237v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A prevailing view holds that supervised fine-tuning (SFT) memorizes training data and fails to generalize, whereas reinforcement learning (RL) attains broader robustness. We revisit this claim through a systematic evaluation on two decision-making benchmarks, Sokoban and General Points, and arrive at a different conclusion. We show that much of SFT's perceived failure stems from frozen-prompt artifacts: when trained on fixed instruction templates, SFT models cling to training semantics rather than adapting to new ones. Introducing prompt diversity during training breaks this shortcut and yields strong generalization to unseen instruction variants without harming in-distribution performance. Beyond instruction shifts, we ask whether SFT can generalize to strictly harder tasks. Here, chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision provides an algorithmic scaffold that markedly improves transfer to more difficult regimes, such as larger Sokoban grids with additional boxes and arithmetic with out-of-distribution values or five-card compositions that increase combinatorial complexity. Finally, combining prompt diversity with CoT achieves the best of both worlds: robust generalization across both instruction-variant and difficulty-variant settings, matching or surpassing RL baselines on our benchmarks while retaining SFT's simplicity and stability. These findings challenge the narrative that SFT is inherently inferior to RL and support a data-centric perspective: with appropriately curated demonstrations, vanilla SFT can generalize as strongly as RL.

| **[Guard Vector: Beyond English LLM Guardrails with Task-Vector Composition and Streaming-Aware Prefix SFT](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23381v1)** | 2025-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Guard Vector, a safety task vector computed as the parameter difference between a guardrail model (Guard Model) and a same-architecture pretrained language model. Composing this vector with a target language model yields a Target Guard Model (TGM). We then adapt TGM with a streaming-aware approach that combines prefix-based training and evaluation with a classifier that produces a single-token output. With this composition alone, TGM improves classification quality over established Guard Models across standard safety suites and enables language extensibility to Chinese, Japanese, and Korean, requiring neither additional training nor target language labels. It also demonstrates model portability across two widely used public guardrail backbones, Llama and Gemma. With prefix SFT (supervised fine-tuning), TGM preserves classification quality under streaming by aligning the behavior between prefix inputs and full-text inputs. The single-token output design increases throughput and reduces latency. Together, these components reduce data and compute requirements while promoting streaming-aware evaluation practices, thereby contributing to a more responsible AI ecosystem.</p></details> |  |
| **[RL Squeezes, SFT Expands: A Comparative Study of Reasoning LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21128v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are typically trained by reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rewards (RLVR) and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on reasoning traces to improve their reasoning abilities. However, how these methods shape reasoning capabilities remains largely elusive. Going beyond an accuracy-based investigation of how these two components sculpt the reasoning process, this paper introduces a novel analysis framework that quantifies reasoning paths and captures their qualitative changes under each training process (with models of 1.5B, 7B, and 14B parameters on mathematical domains). Specifically, we investigate the reasoning process at two levels of granularity: the trajectory-level, which examines complete reasoning outputs, and the step-level, which analyzes reasoning graphs whose nodes correspond to individual reasoning steps. Notably, clustering of unique reasoning trajectories shows complementary effects: RL compresses incorrect trajectories, whereas SFT expands correct ones. Step-level analysis reveals that RL steepens (about 2.5 times), while SFT flattens (reduced to about one-third), the decay rates of node visitation frequency, degree, and betweenness centrality distributions in the reasoning graph. This indicates that RL concentrates reasoning functionality into a small subset of steps, while SFT homogenizes it across many steps. Furthermore, by evaluating the reasoning graph topologies from multiple perspectives, we delineate the shared and distinct characteristics of RL and SFT. Our work presents a novel reasoning path perspective that explains why the current best practice of two-stage training, with SFT followed by RL, is successful, and offers practical implications for data construction and more efficient learning approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[SFT Doesn't Always Hurt General Capabilities: Revisiting Domain-Specific Fine-Tuning in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20758v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on domain-specific datasets is a common approach to adapt Large Language Models (LLMs) to specialized tasks but is often believed to degrade their general capabilities. In this work, we revisit this trade-off and present both empirical and theoretical insights. First, we show that SFT does not always hurt: using a smaller learning rate can substantially mitigate general performance degradation while preserving comparable target-domain performance. We then provide a theoretical analysis that explains these phenomena and further motivates a new method, Token-Adaptive Loss Reweighting (TALR). Building on this, and recognizing that smaller learning rates alone do not fully eliminate general-performance degradation in all cases, we evaluate a range of strategies for reducing general capability loss, including L2 regularization, LoRA, model averaging, FLOW, and our proposed TALR. Experimental results demonstrate that while no method completely eliminates the trade-off, TALR consistently outperforms these baselines in balancing domain-specific gains and general capabilities. Finally, we distill our findings into practical guidelines for adapting LLMs to new domains: (i) using a small learning rate to achieve a favorable trade-off, and (ii) when a stronger balance is further desired, adopt TALR as an effective strategy.</p></details> |  |

Utilizing the Anthropic Helpful-Harmless RLHF dataset, we train and evaluate four models: the base OPT350M, an SFT model, a DPO model, and a model trained with both SFT and DPO. We introduce three key evaluation metrics: Harmlessness Rate (HmR), Helpfulness Rate (HpR), and a Combined Alignment Score (CAS), all derived from reward model outputs. The results show that while SFT outperforms DPO, The combined SFT+DPO model outperforms all others across all metrics, demonstrating the complementary nature of these techniques.

However, the evolution and mechanism behind the synergy of SFT and RL are still under-explored and inconclusive. In our study, we find the well-known claim "SFT memorizes, RL generalizes" is over-simplified, and discover that: (1) OOD performance peaks at the early stage of SFT and then declines (OOD forgetting), the best SFT checkpoint cannot be captured by training/test loss; (2) the subsequent RL stage does not generate fundamentally better OOD capability, instead it plays an \textbf{OOD restoration} role, recovering the lost reasoning ability during SFT; (3) The recovery ability has boundaries, \ie{} \textbf{if SFT trains for too short or too long, RL cannot recover the lost OOD ability;} (4) To uncover the underlying mechanisms behind the forgetting and restoration process, we employ SVD analysis on parameter matrices, manually edit them, and observe their impacts on model performance. Unlike the common belief that the shift of model capacity mainly results from the changes of singular values, we find that they are actually quite stable throughout fine-tuning. Instead, the OOD behavior strongly correlates with the \textbf{rotation of singular vectors}. Our findings re-identify the roles of SFT and RL in the two-stage fine-tuning and discover the rotation of singular vectors as the key mechanism. %reversing the rotations induced by SFT, which shows recovery from forgetting, whereas imposing the SFT parameter directions onto a RL-tuned model results in performance degradation.

| **[Blockwise SFT for Diffusion Language Models: Reconciling Bidirectional Attention and Autoregressive Decoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19529v1)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Discrete diffusion language models have shown strong potential for text generation, yet standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT) misaligns with their semi-autoregressive inference: training randomly masks tokens across the entire response, while inference generates fixed-size blocks sequentially. This mismatch introduces noisy prefixes and leaky suffixes, biasing gradients away from the desired blockwise likelihood. We propose Blockwise SFT, which partitions responses into fixed-size blocks, selects one active block per step for stochastic masking, freezes all preceding tokens, and fully hides future ones. Loss is computed only over the active block, directly mirroring the blockwise decoding process. Experiments on GSM8K, MATH, and MetaMathQA show consistent gains over classical SFT under equal compute or token budgets. Block size consistency studies and ablations confirm that improvements stem from faithful training-inference alignment rather than incidental masking effects. Our results highlight the importance of matching supervision granularity to the decoding procedure in diffusion-based language models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Breaking the SFT Plateau: Multimodal Structured Reinforcement Learning for Chart-to-Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13587v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While reinforcement learning (RL) has proven highly effective for general reasoning in vision-language models, its application to tasks requiring in-depth understanding of information-rich images and generation of structured outputs remains underexplored. Chart-to-code generation exemplifies this challenge, demanding complex reasoning over visual charts to generate structured code. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) alone is often insufficient, highlighting the need for effective RL strategies that appropriately reward structured outputs. We systematically investigate the performance plateau in SFT through large-scale experiments and propose Multimodal Structured Reinforcement Learning (MSRL) for chart-to-code generation, which substantially breaks through this plateau. We construct the largest training corpus to date, containing 3 million chart-code pairs from real-world arXiv tables to mitigate simplistic patterns of prior synthetic data. Despite reaching state-of-the-art performance, our experiments show that scaling SFT data eventually hits a plateau where further increases yield negligible improvements. Our MSRL method leverages a multi-granularity structured reward system using multimodal textual and visual feedback. At the textual level, rule-based rewards validate fine-grained code details. At the visual level, model-based rewards assess structural similarity by rendering generated code into images and employing an evaluator model. We implement this within a two-stage curriculum for training stability. Results demonstrate that MSRL significantly breaks the SFT plateau, improving high-level metrics by 6.2% and 9.9% on ChartMimic and ReachQA benchmarks respectively, achieving competitive performance with advanced closed-source models.</p></details> | technical report |

Two particularly popular approaches are reinforcement learning (RL) and supervised fine-tuning (SFT), but their training dynamics are poorly understood. We present a comparative analysis of RL and SFT on the same maths problems with the same model and similar hyperparameters. We find that RL yields minor in-domain gains on maths and slight degradation on knowledge-intensive benchmarks like MMLU, while both trends are more pronounced in SFT. We also analyse model parameters across checkpoints, observing that both algorithms modify query and key weights the most. Meanwhile, SFT exhibits greater updates and also affects mid-layer MLPs more, leading us to hypothesise that this may have caused the out-of-domain degradation. We therefore investigate whether freezing parts of the model during training can mitigate the reduced performance on knowledge-intensive benchmarks. However, our results are inconclusive, with benefits on GPQA:Diamond and degradation on other benchmarks. Taken together, our observations provide a preliminary indication for why RL amplifies existing capabilities, while SFT replaces old skills with new ones.</p></details> |  |

While text-based reasoning models (e.g., Deepseek R1) show promising results in text-only tasks, distilling their reasoning into LVLMs via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) often results in performance degradation due to imprecise visual grounding. Conversely, purely reinforcement learning (RL)-based methods face a large search space, hindering the emergence of reflective behaviors in smaller models (e.g., 7B LVLMs). Surprisingly, alternating between SFT and RL ultimately results in significant performance improvements after a few iterations. Our analysis reveals that the base model rarely exhibits reasoning behaviors initially, but SFT effectively surfaces these latent actions and narrows the RL search space, accelerating the development of reasoning capabilities. Each subsequent RL stage further refines the model's reasoning skills, producing higher-quality SFT data for continued self-improvement. OpenVLThinker-7B consistently advances performance across six benchmarks demanding mathematical and general reasoning, notably improving MathVista by 3.8%, EMMA by 2.4%, and HallusionBench by 1.6%. Beyond demonstrating the synergy between SFT and RL for complex reasoning tasks, our findings provide early evidence towards achieving R1-style reasoning in multimodal contexts.

While Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) are the dominant training paradigms, a systematic methodology for combining them to maximize both accuracy and efficiency remains largely unexplored. This paper introduces a practical and effective training recipe that strategically integrates extended SFT with RL from online inference (GRPO). We posit that these methods play complementary, not competing, roles: a prolonged SFT phase first pushes the model's accuracy to its limits, after which a GRPO phase dramatically improves token efficiency while preserving this peak performance. Our experiments reveal that extending SFT for as many as 10 epochs is crucial for performance breakthroughs, and that the primary role of GRPO in this framework is to optimize solution length. The efficacy of our recipe is rigorously validated through top-tier performance on challenging benchmarks, including a high rank among over 2,200 teams in the strictly leak-free AI Mathematical Olympiad (AIMO). This work provides the community with a battle-tested blueprint for developing state-of-the-art mathematical reasoners that are both exceptionally accurate and practically efficient. To ensure full reproducibility and empower future research, we will open-source our entire framework, including all code, model checkpoints, and training configurations at https://github.com/analokmaus/kaggle-aimo2-fast-math-r1.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at ICML 2025 Workshop on The second AI for MATH</p></details> |
| **[The Synergy Dilemma of Long-CoT SFT and RL: Investigating Post-Training Techniques for Reasoning VLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07562v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large vision-language models (VLMs) increasingly adopt post-training techniques such as long chain-of-thought (CoT) supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) to elicit sophisticated reasoning. While these methods exhibit synergy in language-only models, their joint effectiveness in VLMs remains uncertain. We present a systematic investigation into the distinct roles and interplay of long-CoT SFT and RL across multiple multimodal reasoning benchmarks. We find that SFT improves performance on difficult questions by in-depth, structured reasoning, but introduces verbosity and degrades performance on simpler ones. In contrast, RL promotes generalization and brevity, yielding consistent improvements across all difficulty levels, though the improvements on the hardest questions are less prominent compared to SFT. Surprisingly, combining them through two-staged, interleaved, or progressive training strategies, as well as data mixing and model merging, all fails to produce additive benefits, instead leading to trade-offs in accuracy, reasoning style, and response length. This ``synergy dilemma'' highlights the need for more seamless and adaptive approaches to unlock the full potential of combined post-training techniques for reasoning VLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Implicit Reward as the Bridge: A Unified View of SFT and DPO Connections](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00018v2)** | 2025-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Post-training processes are essential phases in grounding pre-trained language models to real-world tasks, with learning from demonstrations or preference signals playing a crucial role in this adaptation. We present a unified theoretical framework bridging Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and preference learning in Large Language Model (LLM) post-training. Through rigorous mathematical derivation, we demonstrate that both SFT and preference learning methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) operate within the same optimal policy-reward subspace, with SFT representing a special case of implicit reward learning. Our analysis reveals a critical limitation in conventional SFT: the KL divergence term in distribution matching becomes constant with respect to the policy during optimization, failing to constrain model updates. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective learning rate reduction approach that yields significant performance improvements (up to \textbf{25\%} relative gain and \textbf{6\%} absolute win rate increase in instruction following tasks. Additionally, we derive alternative SFT objectives from various f-divergence functions that preserve the KL term during optimization, further enhancing post-DPO model performance. Finally, we extend the theoretical relationship between LLM logits and Q-functions from preference learning to the SFT context, providing mathematical derivations and experimental validation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bridging SFT and DPO for Diffusion Model Alignment with Self-Sampling Preference Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05255v2)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing post-training techniques are broadly categorized into supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) methods; the former is stable during training but suffers from limited generalization, while the latter, despite its stronger generalization capability, relies on additional preference data or reward models and carries the risk of reward exploitation. In order to preserve the advantages of both SFT and RL -- namely, eliminating the need for paired data and reward models while retaining the training stability of SFT and the generalization ability of RL -- a new alignment method, Self-Sampling Preference Optimization (SSPO), is proposed in this paper. SSPO introduces a Random Checkpoint Replay (RCR) strategy that utilizes historical checkpoints to construct paired data, thereby effectively mitigating overfitting. Simultaneously, a Self-Sampling Regularization (SSR) strategy is employed to dynamically evaluate the quality of generated samples; when the generated samples are more likely to be winning samples, the approach automatically switches from DPO (Direct Preference Optimization) to SFT, ensuring that the training process accurately reflects the quality of the samples. Experimental results demonstrate that SSPO not only outperforms existing methods on text-to-image benchmarks, but its effectiveness has also been validated in text-to-video tasks. We validate SSPO across both text-to-image and text-to-video benchmarks. SSPO surpasses all previous approaches on the text-to-image benchmarks and demonstrates outstanding performance on the text-to-video benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

However, existing approaches often fall short: methods solely employing reinforcement learning (RL) can struggle with sample inefficiency and activating entirely absent reasoning capabilities, while conventional pipelines that initiate with a cold-start supervised fine-tuning (SFT) phase before RL may restrict the model's exploratory capacity and face suboptimal convergence. In this work, we introduce \textbf{Metis-RISE} (\textbf{R}L \textbf{I}ncentivizes and \textbf{S}FT \textbf{E}nhances) for multimodal reasoning model learning. Unlike conventional approaches, Metis-RISE distinctively omits an initial SFT stage, beginning instead with an RL phase (e.g., using a Group Relative Policy Optimization variant) to incentivize and activate the model's latent reasoning capacity. Subsequently, the targeted SFT stage addresses two key challenges identified during RL: (1) \textit{inefficient trajectory sampling} for tasks where the model possesses but inconsistently applies correct reasoning, which we tackle using self-distilled reasoning trajectories from the RL model itself; and (2) \textit{fundamental capability absence}, which we address by injecting expert-augmented knowledge for prompts where the model entirely fails. This strategic application of RL for incentivization followed by SFT for enhancement forms the core of Metis-RISE, leading to two versions of our MLLMs (7B and 72B parameters). Evaluations on the OpenCompass Multimodal Reasoning Leaderboard demonstrate that both models achieve state-of-the-art performance among similar-sized models, with the 72B version ranking fourth overall.

The standard training approach combines a supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage, often to distill capabilities of a larger model, followed by a reinforcement learning (RL)stage such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). In this paper, we investigate the fundamental limitations of this SFT + RL paradigm and propose methods to overcome them. Under a suitable theoretical model, we demonstrate that the SFT + RL strategy can fail completely when (1) the expert's traces are too difficult for the small model to express, or (2) the small model's initialization has exponentially small likelihood of success. To address these, we introduce BREAD: a GRPO variant that unifies the SFT and RL stages via partial expert guidance and branched rollouts. When self-generated traces fail, BREAD adaptively inserts short expert prefixes/hints, allowing the small model to complete the rest of the reasoning path, and ensuring that each update includes at least one successful trace. This mechanism both densifies the reward signal and induces a natural learning curriculum. BREAD requires fewer than 40% of ground-truth traces, consistently outperforming standard GRPO while speeding up the training by about 3 times. Importantly, we demonstrate that BREAD helps the model solve problems that are otherwise unsolvable by the SFT + RL strategy, highlighting how branched rollouts and expert guidance can substantially boost SLM reasoning.</p></details> |  |

We begin by curating the SFT training data through two scaling strategies: increasing the number of collected prompts and the number of generated responses per prompt. Both approaches yield notable improvements in reasoning performance, with scaling the number of prompts resulting in more substantial gains. We then explore the following questions regarding the synergy between SFT and RL: (i) Does a stronger SFT model consistently lead to better final performance after large-scale RL training? (ii) How can we determine an appropriate sampling temperature during RL training to effectively balance exploration and exploitation for a given SFT initialization? Our findings suggest that (i) holds true, provided effective RL training is conducted, particularly when the sampling temperature is carefully chosen to maintain the temperature-adjusted entropy around 0.3, a setting that strikes a good balance between exploration and exploitation. Notably, the performance gap between initial SFT models narrows significantly throughout the RL process. Leveraging a strong SFT foundation and insights into the synergistic interplay between SFT and RL, our AceReason-Nemotron-1.1 7B model significantly outperforms AceReason-Nemotron-1.0 and achieves new state-of-the-art performance among Qwen2.5-7B-based reasoning models on challenging math and code benchmarks, thereby demonstrating the effectiveness of our post-training recipe.

Exploring the Interplay of SFT and RL in Enhancing LLM Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24273v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs) have effectively improved their reasoning abilities, particularly on mathematical and logical problems that have verifiable answers, through techniques such as supervised finetuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL). Prior research indicates that RL effectively internalizes search strategies, enabling long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, with backtracking emerging naturally as a learned capability. However, the precise benefits of backtracking, specifically, how significantly it contributes to reasoning improvements and the optimal extent of its use, remain poorly understood. In this work, we systematically investigate the dynamics between SFT and RL on eight reasoning tasks: Countdown, Sudoku, Arc 1D, Geometry, Color Cube Rotation, List Functions, Zebra Puzzles, and Self Reference. Our findings highlight that short CoT sequences used in SFT as a warm-up do have moderate contribution to RL training, compared with cold-start RL; however such contribution diminishes when tasks become increasingly difficult. Motivated by this observation, we construct synthetic datasets varying systematically in the number of backtracking steps and conduct controlled experiments to isolate the influence of either the correctness (content) or the structure (i.e., backtrack frequency). We find that (1) longer CoT with backtracks generally induce better and more stable RL training, (2) more challenging problems with larger search space tend to need higher numbers of backtracks during the SFT stage. Additionally, we demonstrate through experiments on distilled data that RL training is largely unaffected by the correctness of long CoT sequences, suggesting that RL prioritizes structural patterns over content correctness. Collectively, our results offer practical insights into designing optimal training strategies to effectively scale reasoning in LLMs.</p></details> |  |

However, their roles in enhancing model generalization capabilities remain unclear. This paper studies the difference between SFT and RL on generalization and memorization, focusing on text-based rule variants and visual variants. We introduce GeneralPoints, an arithmetic reasoning card game, and adopt V-IRL, a real-world navigation environment, to assess how models trained with SFT and RL generalize to unseen variants in both textual and visual domains. We show that RL, especially when trained with an outcome-based reward, generalizes across both rule-based textual and visual variants. SFT, in contrast, tends to memorize training data and struggles to generalize out-of-distribution scenarios. Further analysis reveals that RL improves the model's underlying visual recognition capabilities, contributing to its enhanced generalization in the visual domain. Despite RL's superior generalization, we show that SFT remains essential for effective RL training; SFT stabilizes the model's output format, enabling subsequent RL to achieve its performance gains. These findings demonstrates the capability of RL for acquiring generalizable knowledge in complex, multi-modal tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website at https://tianzhechu.com/SFTvsRL</p></details> |

In this work, we propose SOAEsV2-7B/72B, a specialized LLM series developed via a three-phase framework: 1) continual pre-training integrates domain knowledge while retaining base capabilities; 2) domain-progressive SFT employs curriculum-based learning strategy, transitioning from weakly relevant conversational data to expert-annotated SOAEs datasets to optimize domain-specific tasks; 3) distillation-enhanced speculative decoding accelerates inference via logit distillation between 72B target and 7B draft models, achieving 1.39-1.52$\times$ speedup without quality loss. Experimental results demonstrate that our domain-specific pre-training phase maintains 99.8% of original general language capabilities while significantly improving domain performance, resulting in a 1.08$\times$ improvement in Rouge-1 score and a 1.17$\times$ enhancement in BLEU-4 score. Ablation studies further show that domain-progressive SFT outperforms single-stage training, achieving 1.02$\times$ improvement in Rouge-1 and 1.06$\times$ in BLEU-4. Our work introduces a comprehensive, full-pipeline approach for optimizing SOAEs LLMs, bridging the gap between general language capabilities and domain-specific expertise.</p></details> |  |

With the rapid scaling of Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly through reinforcement learning (RL), there is a growing need for more capable discriminators. Consequently, advances in classification are becoming increasingly vital for enhancing the overall capabilities of LLMs. Traditional discriminative methods map text to labels but overlook LLMs' intrinsic generative strengths. Generative classification addresses this by prompting the model to directly output labels. However, existing studies still rely on simple SFT alone, seldom probing the interplay between training and inference prompts, and no work has systematically leveraged RL for generative text classifiers and unified SFT, RL, and inference-time prompting in one framework. We bridge this gap with GenCLS++, a framework that jointly optimizes SFT and RL while systematically exploring five high-level strategy dimensions-in-context learning variants, category definitions, explicit uncertainty labels, semantically irrelevant numeric labels, and perplexity-based decoding-during both training and inference. After an SFT "policy warm-up," we apply RL with a simple rule-based reward, yielding sizable extra gains. Across seven datasets, GenCLS++ achieves an average accuracy improvement of 3.46% relative to the naive SFT baseline; on public datasets, this improvement rises to 4.00%. Notably, unlike reasoning-intensive tasks that benefit from explicit thinking processes, we find that classification tasks perform better without such reasoning steps. These insights into the role of explicit reasoning provide valuable guidance for future LLM applications.</p></details> |  |

However, the specific capabilities enhanced through such fine-tuning remain poorly understood. In this paper, we conduct a detailed analysis of model performance on the AIME24 dataset to understand how reasoning capabilities evolve. We discover a ladder-like structure in problem difficulty, categorize questions into four tiers (Easy, Medium, Hard, and Extremely Hard (Exh)), and identify the specific requirements for advancing between tiers. We find that progression from Easy to Medium tier requires adopting an R1 reasoning style with minimal SFT (500-1K instances), while Hard-level questions suffer from frequent model's errors at each step of the reasoning chain, with accuracy plateauing at around 65% despite logarithmic scaling. Exh-level questions present a fundamentally different challenge; they require unconventional problem-solving skills that current models uniformly struggle with. Additional findings reveal that carefully curated small-scale datasets offer limited advantage-scaling dataset size proves far more effective. Our analysis provides a clearer roadmap for advancing language model capabilities in mathematical reasoning.</p></details> |  |

An Early Investigation into Training R1-Like Reasoning Large Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11468v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work revisits the dominant supervised fine-tuning (SFT) then reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm for training Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), and reveals a key finding: SFT can significantly undermine subsequent RL by inducing ``pseudo reasoning paths'' imitated from expert models. While these paths may resemble the native reasoning paths of RL models, they often involve prolonged, hesitant, less informative steps, and incorrect reasoning. To systematically study this effect, we introduce VLAA-Thinking, a new multimodal dataset designed to support reasoning in LVLMs. Constructed via a six-step pipeline involving captioning, reasoning distillation, answer rewrite and verification, VLAA-Thinking comprises high-quality, step-by-step visual reasoning traces for SFT, along with a more challenging RL split from the same data source. Using this dataset, we conduct extensive experiments comparing SFT, RL and their combinations. Results show that while SFT helps models learn reasoning formats, it often locks aligned models into imitative, rigid reasoning modes that impede further learning. In contrast, building on the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a novel mixed reward module integrating both perception and cognition signals, our RL approach fosters more genuine, adaptive reasoning behavior. Notably, our model VLAA-Thinker, based on Qwen2.5VL 3B, achieves top-1 performance on Open LMM Reasoning Leaderboard (https://huggingface.co/spaces/opencompass/Open_LMM_Reasoning_Leaderboard) among 4B scale LVLMs, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art by 1.8%. We hope our findings provide valuable insights in developing reasoning-capable LVLMs and can inform future research in this area.</p></details> |  |

However, to enhance its utility and reduce potential harm, SFT and alignment are applied sequentially to the pretrained model. Due to the differing nature and objective functions of SFT and alignment, catastrophic forgetting has become a significant issue. To address this, we introduce Unified Fine-Tuning (UFT), which integrates SFT and alignment into a single training stage using the same objective and loss functions through an implicit reward function. Our experimental results demonstrate that UFT outperforms SFT on instruction-tuning data alone. Moreover, when combining instruction-tuning data with alignment data, UFT effectively prevents catastrophic forgetting across these two stages and shows a clear advantage over sequentially applying SFT and alignment. This is evident in the significant improvements observed in the \textbf{ifeval} task for instruction-following and the \textbf{truthful-qa} task for factuality. The proposed general fine-tuning framework UFT establishes an effective and efficient pretraining-UFT paradigm for LLM training.</p></details> |  |

However, existing approaches struggle with temporal reasoning due to weak temporal correspondence in the data and reliance on the next-token prediction paradigm during training. To address these limitations, we propose TEMPLE (TEMporal Preference Learning), a systematic framework that enhances Video LLMs' temporal reasoning capabilities through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). To facilitate this, we introduce an automated preference data generation pipeline that systematically constructs preference pairs by selecting videos that are rich in temporal information, designing video-specific perturbation strategies, and finally evaluating model responses on clean and perturbed video inputs. Our temporal alignment features two key innovations: curriculum learning which that progressively increases perturbation difficulty to improve model robustness and adaptability; and "Pre-SFT Alignment'', applying preference optimization before instruction tuning to prioritize fine-grained temporal comprehension. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently improves Video LLM performance across multiple benchmarks with a relatively small set of self-generated DPO data. We further analyze the transferability of DPO data across architectures and the role of difficulty scheduling in optimization. Our findings highlight our TEMPLE as a scalable and efficient complement to SFT-based methods, paving the way for developing reliable Video LLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/lscpku/TEMPLE.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bring Remote Sensing Object Detect Into Nature Language Model: Using SFT Method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08144v2)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved significant success, demonstrating remarkable capabilities in understanding various images and videos, particularly in classification and detection tasks. However, due to the substantial differences between remote sensing images and conventional optical images, these models face considerable challenges in comprehension, especially in detection tasks. Directly prompting VLMs with detection instructions often leads to unsatisfactory results. To address this issue, this letter explores the application of VLMs for object detection in remote sensing images. Specifically, we constructed supervised fine-tuning (SFT) datasets using publicly available remote sensing object detection datasets, including SSDD, HRSID, and NWPU-VHR-10. In these new datasets, we converted annotation information into JSON-compliant natural language descriptions, facilitating more effective understanding and training for the VLM. We then evaluate the detection performance of various fine-tuning strategies for VLMs and derive optimized model weights for object detection in remote sensing images. Finally, we evaluate the model's prior knowledge capabilities using natural language queries. Experimental results demonstrate that, without modifying the model architecture, remote sensing object detection can be effectively achieved using natural language alone. Additionally, the model exhibits the ability to perform certain vision question answering (VQA) tasks. Our datasets and related code will be released soon.</p></details> |  |

However, attempts to extend this success to multimodal reasoning often failed to reproduce these key characteristics. In this report, we present the first successful replication of these emergent characteristics for multimodal reasoning on only a non-SFT 2B model. Starting with Qwen2-VL-2B and applying reinforcement learning directly on the SAT dataset, our model achieves 59.47% accuracy on CVBench, outperforming the base model by approximately ~30% and exceeding both SFT setting by ~2%. In addition, we share our failed attempts and insights in attempting to achieve R1-like reasoning using RL with instruct models. aiming to shed light on the challenges involved.

However, RLHF has been continuously challenged by its high complexity in implementation and computation consumption. Even with recent simplifications, such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Advantage Leftover Lunch (A-LoL), the problems of over-fitting and training instability remain hindering the alignment process from the expected optimal performance. To address the existing challenges, we propose a novel simplification of RLHF from the perspective of variational inference, called $\textbf{V}$ariational $\textbf{A}$lignment with $\textbf{R}$e-weighting ($\textbf{VAR}$). More specifically, by directly minimizing the distribution gap between the learning LLM policy and the optimal solution of RLHF, we transform the alignment objective into a reward-driven re-weighted supervised fine-tuning (SFT) form, which only requires minor adjustment on the SFT loss to obtain noticeable improvement on training stability and effectiveness. On comprehensive alignment and generation benchmarks, our VAR method has numerically achieved competitive performance in LLM alignment helpfulness and harmlessness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Provably Mitigating Overoptimization in RLHF: Your SFT Loss is Implicitly an Adversarial Regularizer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16436v3)** | 2024-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aligning generative models with human preference via RLHF typically suffers from overoptimization, where an imperfectly learned reward model can misguide the generative model to output undesired responses. We investigate this problem in a principled manner by identifying the source of the misalignment as a form of distributional shift and uncertainty in learning human preferences. To mitigate overoptimization, we first propose a theoretical algorithm that chooses the best policy for an adversarially chosen reward model; one that simultaneously minimizes the maximum likelihood estimation of the loss and a reward penalty term. Here, the reward penalty term is introduced to prevent the policy from choosing actions with spurious high proxy rewards, resulting in provable sample efficiency of the algorithm under a partial coverage style condition. Moving from theory to practice, the proposed algorithm further enjoys an equivalent but surprisingly easy-to-implement reformulation. Using the equivalence between reward models and the corresponding optimal policy, the algorithm features a simple objective that combines: (i) a preference optimization loss that directly aligns the policy with human preference, and (ii) a supervised learning loss that explicitly imitates the policy with a (suitable) baseline distribution. In the context of aligning large language models (LLM), this objective fuses the direct preference optimization (DPO) loss with the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) loss to help mitigate the overoptimization towards undesired responses, for which we name the algorithm Regularized Preference Optimization (RPO). Experiments of aligning LLMs demonstrate the improved performance of RPO compared with DPO baselines. Our work sheds light on the interplay between preference optimization and SFT in tuning LLMs with both theoretical guarantees and empirical evidence.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by The Thirty-Eighth Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems. 31 pages, 7 figures</p></details> |
| **[Continual SFT Matches Multimodal RLHF with Negative Supervision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14797v1)** | 2024-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal RLHF usually happens after supervised finetuning (SFT) stage to continually improve vision-language models' (VLMs) comprehension. Conventional wisdom holds its superiority over continual SFT during this preference alignment stage. In this paper, we observe that the inherent value of multimodal RLHF lies in its negative supervision, the logit of the rejected responses. We thus propose a novel negative supervised finetuning (nSFT) approach that fully excavates these information resided. Our nSFT disentangles this negative supervision in RLHF paradigm, and continually aligns VLMs with a simple SFT loss. This is more memory efficient than multimodal RLHF where 2 (e.g., DPO) or 4 (e.g., PPO) large VLMs are strictly required. The effectiveness of nSFT is rigorously proved by comparing it with various multimodal RLHF approaches, across different dataset sources, base VLMs and evaluation metrics. Besides, fruitful of ablations are provided to support our hypothesis. We hope this paper will stimulate further research to properly align large vision language models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Getting More Juice Out of the SFT Data: Reward Learning from Human Demonstration Improves SFT for LLM Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17888v3)** | 2024-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aligning human preference and value is an important requirement for contemporary foundation models. State-of-the-art techniques such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) often consist of two stages: 1) supervised fine-tuning (SFT), where the model is fine-tuned by learning from human demonstration data; 2) Preference learning, where preference data is used to learn a reward model, which is in turn used by a reinforcement learning (RL) step to fine-tune the model. Such reward model serves as a proxy to human preference, and it is critical to guide the RL step towards improving the model quality. In this work, we argue that the SFT stage significantly benefits from learning a reward model as well. Instead of using the human demonstration data directly via supervised learning, we propose to leverage an Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) technique to simultaneously build an reward model and a policy model. This approach leads to new SFT algorithms that are not only efficient to implement, but are robust to the presence of low-quality supervised learning data. Moreover, we discover a connection between the proposed IRL based approach, and a recent line of works called Self-Play Fine-tune (SPIN). Theoretically, we show that the proposed algorithms converge to the stationary solutions of the IRL problem. Empirically, we align 1B and 7B models using proposed methods and evaluate them on a reward benchmark model and the HuggingFace Open LLM Leaderboard. The proposed methods show significant performance improvement over existing SFT approaches. Our results indicate that it is beneficial to leverage reward learning throughout the entire alignment process.</p></details> |  |

The paradigm contains supervised fine tuning and reinforce learning from human feedback. This paradigm is also used in downstream scenarios to adapt LLM to specific corpora and applications. Comparing to SFT, there are many efforts focused on RLHF and several algorithms being proposed, such as PPO, DPO, IPO, KTO, MinorDPO and etc. Meanwhile most efforts for SFT are focused on how to collect, filter and mix high quality data. In this article with insight from DPO and MinorDPO, we propose a training metric for SFT to measure the discrepancy between the optimized model and the original model, and a loss function MinorSFT that can increase the training effectiveness, and reduce the discrepancy between the optimized LLM and original LLM.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |

However, sourcing this data through human annotation is costly, and existing automated methods often fail to capture the diverse range of contextual granularity and tend to produce homogeneous data. To tackle these issues, we introduce a novel method named AugCon, capable of automatically generating context-driven SFT data across multiple levels of granularity with high diversity, quality and fidelity. AugCon begins by generating queries using the Context-Split-Tree (CST), an innovative approach for recursively deriving queries and splitting context to cover full granularity. Then, we train a scorer through contrastive learning to collaborate with CST to rank and refine queries. Finally, a synergistic integration of self-alignment and self-improving is introduced to obtain high-fidelity responses. Extensive experiments are conducted incorporating both human and automatic evaluations, encompassing a test scenario and four widely-used benchmarks in English and Chinese. The results highlight the significant advantages of AugCon in producing high diversity, quality, and fidelity SFT data against several state-of-the-art methods. All of our code, dataset, and fine-tuned model will be available at: https://github.com/quanshr/AugCon.</p></details> |  |

It typically consists of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) stages. However, RLHF faces inherent limitations stemming from a complex training setup and its tendency to align the model with implicit values that end users cannot control at run-time. Moreover, reward models in RLHF stage commonly rely on single-dimensional feedback as opposed to explicit, multifaceted signals that indicate attributes such as helpfulness, humor, and toxicity. To address these limitations, we propose SteerLM, a supervised fine-tuning method that empowers end-users to control responses during inference. SteerLM conditions responses to conform to an explicitly defined multi-dimensional set of attributes, thereby empowering a steerable AI capable of generating helpful and high-quality responses while maintaining customizability. Experiments show that SteerLM trained on open source datasets generates responses that are preferred by human and automatic evaluators to many state-of-the-art baselines trained with RLHF while being much easier to train.

However, as the number of cascades increases, the improvements in reconstruction tend to become marginal, indicating possible excess model capacity. Knowledge distillation (KD) is an emerging technique to compress these models, in which a trained deep teacher network is used to distill knowledge to a smaller student network such that the student learns to mimic the behavior of the teacher. Most KD methods focus on effectively training the student with a pre-trained teacher unaware of the student model. We propose SFT-KD-Recon, a student-friendly teacher training approach along with the student as a prior step to KD to make the teacher aware of the structure and capacity of the student and enable aligning the representations of the teacher with the student. In SFT, the teacher is jointly trained with the unfolded branch configurations of the student blocks using three loss terms - teacher-reconstruction loss, student-reconstruction loss, and teacher-student imitation loss, followed by KD of the student. We perform extensive experiments for MRI acceleration in 4x and 5x under-sampling on the brain and cardiac datasets on five KD methods using the proposed approach as a prior step. We consider the DC-CNN architecture and setup teacher as D5C5 (141765 parameters), and student as D3C5 (49285 parameters), denoting a compression of 2.87:1. Results show that (i) our approach consistently improves the KD methods with improved reconstruction performance and image quality, and (ii) the student distilled using our approach is competitive with the teacher, with the performance gap reduced from 0.53 dB to 0.03 dB.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 8 figures.

In particular we prove that all generalized Baumslag-Solitar groups (GBS) admit a strongly aperiodic SFT. Our proof is based on a structural theorem by Whyte and on two constructions of strongly aperiodic SFTs on $\mathbb{F}_n\times \mathbb{Z}$ and $BS(m,n)$ of our own. Our two constructions rely on a path-folding technique that lifts an SFT on $\mathbb{Z}^2$ inside an SFT on $\mathbb{F}_n\times \mathbb{Z}$ or an SFT on the hyperbolic plane inside an SFT on $BS(m,n)$. In the case of $\mathbb{F}_n\times \mathbb{Z}$ the path folding technique also preserves minimality, so that we get minimal strongly aperiodic SFTs on unimodular GBS groups.</p></details> | 31 pages, 13 figures |

As a consequence, if $P$ contains a recursive member, $P$ and $X$ have the exact same set of Turing degrees. On the other hand, we prove that if $X$ contains only non-recursive members, some of its members always have different but comparable degrees.

| **[KL-Regularized RLHF with Multiple Reference Models: Exact Solutions and Sample Complexity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01203v3)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent methods for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human feedback predominantly rely on a single reference model, which limits diversity, model overfitting, and underutilizes the wide range of available pre-trained models. Incorporating multiple reference models has the potential to address these limitations by broadening perspectives, reducing bias, and leveraging the strengths of diverse open-source LLMs. However, integrating multiple reference models into reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) frameworks poses significant theoretical challenges, where achieving exact solutions has remained an open problem. This paper presents the first \emph{exact solution} to the multiple reference model problem in reverse KL-regularized RLHF. We introduce a comprehensive theoretical framework that includes rigorous statistical analysis and provides sample complexity guarantees. Additionally, we extend our analysis to forward KL-regularized RLHF, offering new insights into sample complexity requirements in multiple reference scenarios. Our contributions lay the foundation for more advanced and adaptable LLM alignment techniques, enabling the effective use of multiple reference models. This work paves the way for developing alignment frameworks that are both theoretically sound and better suited to the challenges of modern AI ecosystems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Extra...</summary><p>Extra experiments are added in new version</p></details> |

While guaranteeing DP generally requires explicitly injecting noise either to the algorithm itself or to its outputs, the intrinsic randomness of existing algorithms presents an opportunity to achieve DP ``for free''. In this work, we explore the role of regularization in achieving DP across three different decision-making problems: multi-armed bandits, linear contextual bandits, and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), in offline data settings. We show that adding KL-regularization to the learning objective (a common approach in optimization algorithms) makes the action sampled from the resulting stochastic policy itself differentially private. This offers a new route to privacy guarantees without additional noise injection, while also preserving the inherent advantage of regularization in enhancing performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Information-Theoretic Reward Modeling for Stable RLHF: Detecting and Mitigating Reward Hacking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13694v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the success of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) in aligning language models with human values, reward hacking-or reward over-optimization-remains a major challenge. We identify two key obstacles to its mitigation: (1) reward misgeneralization in reward modeling, where reward models overfit to spurious, preference-irrelevant features; and (2) the lack of suitable regularization during RL optimization, as existing token-level constraints often over-restrict the policy space. To address these issues, we propose InfoRM, an information-theoretic reward modeling framework based on the Information Bottleneck (IB) principle, which filters out preference-irrelevant information to alleviate reward misgeneralization. We further observe that reward-hacked responses manifest as pronounced outliers in InfoRM's IB latent space, measured by Mahalanobis distance from the SFT-induced distribution. Motivated by this, we introduce IBL, a distribution-level regularization that penalizes such deviations, effectively expanding the optimization landscape while maintaining alignment. We prove that IBL is theoretically equivalent to the pessimistic RL objective within the IB latent space. Finally, we present Mahalanobis Outlier Probability (MOP), a statistical metric for quantifying reward hacking severity, enabling principled hyperparameter tuning and online mitigation such as early stopping. Extensive experiments across diverse LLMs and datasets confirm the generality of our findings, the effectiveness of InfoRM and IBL, and the reliability of MOP as a diagnostic tool-collectively advancing the state of RLHF.</p></details> | <details><summary>46 pa...</summary><p>46 pages, 36 figures, submitted to IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence</p></details> |
| **[Offline and Online KL-Regularized RLHF under Differential Privacy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13512v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we study the offline and online settings of reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) with KL-regularization -- a widely used objective function in large language model alignment -- under the $\epsilon$ local differential privacy ($\epsilon$-LDP) model on the label of the human preference. In the offline setting, we design an algorithm based on the principle of pessimism and derive a new suboptimality gap of $\tilde{O}(1/[(e^\epsilon-1)^2 n])$ on the KL-regularized objective under single-policy concentrability. We also prove its optimality by providing a matching lower bound where $n$ is the sample size. In the online setting, we are the first one to theoretically investigate the problem of KL-regularized RLHF with LDP. We design an optimism-based algorithm and derive a logarithmic regret bound of $O(d_{\mathcal{F}}\log (N_{\mathcal{F}}\cdot T) /(e^\epsilon-1)^2 )$, where $T$ is the total time step, $N_{\mathcal{F}}$ is cardinality of the reward function space $\mathcal{F}$ and $d_{\mathcal{F}}$ is a variant of eluder dimension for RLHF. As a by-product of our analysis, our results also imply the first analysis for online KL-regularized RLHF without privacy. We implement our algorithm in the offline setting to verify our theoretical results and release our open source code at: https://github.com/rushil-thareja/PPKL-RLHF-Official.</p></details> |  |
| **[General Exploratory Bonus for Optimistic Exploration in RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03269v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optimistic exploration is central to improving sample efficiency in reinforcement learning with human feedback, yet existing exploratory bonus methods to incentivize exploration often fail to realize optimism. We provide a theoretical analysis showing that current formulations, under KL or $\alpha$-divergence regularization, unintentionally bias exploration toward high-probability regions of the reference model, thereby reinforcing conservative behavior instead of promoting discovery of uncertain regions. To address this pitfall, we introduce the General Exploratory Bonus (GEB), a novel theoretical framework that provably satisfies the optimism principle. GEB counteracts divergence-induced bias via reference-dependent reward regulation and unifies prior heuristic bonuses as special cases, while extending naturally across the full $\alpha$-divergence family. Empirically, GEB consistently outperforms baselines on alignment tasks across multiple divergence settings and large language model backbones. These results demonstrate that GEB offers both a principled and practical solution for optimistic exploration in RLHF.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Hidden Link Between RLHF and Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22578v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human values has recently garnered significant attention, with prominent examples including the canonical yet costly Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and the simple Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). In this work, we demonstrate that both RLHF and DPO can be interpreted from the perspective of mutual information (MI) maximization, uncovering a profound connection to contrastive learning. Within this framework, both RLHF and DPO can be interpreted as methods that performing contrastive learning based on the positive and negative samples derived from base model, leveraging the Donsker-Varadhan (DV) lower bound on MI (equivalently, the MINE estimator). Such paradigm further illuminates why RLHF may not intrinsically incentivize reasoning capacities in LLMs beyond what is already present in the base model. Building on the perspective, we replace the DV/MINE bound with the Jensen-Shannon (JS) MI estimator and propose the Mutual Information Optimization (MIO). Comprehensive theoretical analysis and extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that MIO mitigates the late-stage decline in chosen-likelihood observed in DPO, achieving competitive or superior performance across various challenging reasoning and mathematical benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Understanding Sampler Stochasticity in Training Diffusion Models for RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10767v1)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is increasingly used to fine-tune diffusion models, but a key challenge arises from the mismatch between stochastic samplers used during training and deterministic samplers used during inference. In practice, models are fine-tuned using stochastic SDE samplers to encourage exploration, while inference typically relies on deterministic ODE samplers for efficiency and stability. This discrepancy induces a reward gap, raising concerns about whether high-quality outputs can be expected during inference. In this paper, we theoretically characterize this reward gap and provide non-vacuous bounds for general diffusion models, along with sharper convergence rates for Variance Exploding (VE) and Variance Preserving (VP) Gaussian models. Methodologically, we adopt the generalized denoising diffusion implicit models (gDDIM) framework to support arbitrarily high levels of stochasticity, preserving data marginals throughout. Empirically, our findings through large-scale experiments on text-to-image models using denoising diffusion policy optimization (DDPO) and mixed group relative policy optimization (MixGRPO) validate that reward gaps consistently narrow over training, and ODE sampling quality improves when models are updated using higher-stochasticity SDE training.</p></details> |  |
| **[GREAT: Generalizable Backdoor Attacks in RLHF via Emotion-Aware Trigger Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09260v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent work has shown that RLHF is highly susceptible to backdoor attacks, poisoning schemes that inject malicious triggers in preference data. However, existing methods often rely on static, rare-token-based triggers, limiting their effectiveness in realistic scenarios. In this paper, we develop GREAT, a novel framework for crafting generalizable backdoors in RLHF through emotion-aware trigger synthesis. Specifically, GREAT targets harmful response generation for a vulnerable user subgroup characterized by both semantically violent requests and emotionally angry triggers. At the core of GREAT is a trigger identification pipeline that operates in the latent embedding space, leveraging principal component analysis and clustering techniques to identify the most representative triggers. To enable this, we present Erinyes, a high-quality dataset of over $5000$ angry triggers curated from GPT-4.1 using a principled, hierarchical, and diversity-promoting approach. Experiments on benchmark RLHF datasets demonstrate that GREAT significantly outperforms baseline methods in attack success rates, especially for unseen trigger scenarios, while largely preserving the response quality on benign inputs.</p></details> |  |

However, existing frameworks commonly face challenges such as inference bottlenecks and complexity barriers, which restrict their accessibility to newcomers. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{OpenRLHF}, a user-friendly, scalable, and easy-to-learn open-source RLHF framework built upon Ray, vLLM, DeepSpeed, and HuggingFace Transformers, featuring a simplified design, clear code structure, and comprehensive documentation to facilitate entry for researchers and practitioners. Experimental results show that OpenRLHF achieves superior training efficiency, with speedups ranging from 1.22x to 1.68x across different model sizes, compared to state-of-the-art frameworks. Additionally, it requires significantly fewer lines of code for implementation. OpenRLHF is publicly available at https://github.com/OpenRLHF/OpenRLHF, and has already been adopted by leading institutions to accelerate RLHF research and learning.</p></details> | update template |
| **[Provably Mitigating Corruption, Overoptimization, and Verbosity Simultaneously in Offline and Online RLHF/DPO Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05526v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and direct preference optimization (DPO) are important techniques to align large language models (LLM) with human preference. However, the quality of RLHF and DPO training is seriously compromised by \textit{\textbf{C}orrupted} preference, reward \textit{\textbf{O}veroptimization}, and bias towards \textit{\textbf{V}erbosity}. To our knowledge, most existing works tackle only one of these important issues, and the few other works require much computation to estimate multiple reward models and lack theoretical guarantee of generalization ability. In this work, we propose RLHF-\textbf{COV} and DPO-\textbf{COV} algorithms that can simultaneously mitigate these three issues, in both offline and online settings. This ability is theoretically demonstrated by obtaining length-regularized generalization error rates for our DPO-COV algorithms trained on corrupted data, which match the best-known rates for simpler cases with clean data and without length regularization. Moreover, our DPO-COV algorithm is simple to implement without reward estimation, and is proved to be equivalent to our RLHF-COV algorithm, which directly implies the equivalence between the vanilla RLHF and DPO algorithms. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our DPO-COV algorithms under both offline and online settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Margin RLHF via Preference over Preferences](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22851v2)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Margin-based optimization is fundamental to improving generalization and robustness in classification tasks. In the context of reward model learning from preferences within Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), existing methods typically rely on no margins, fixed margins, or margins that are simplistic functions of preference ratings. However, such formulations often fail to account for the varying strengths of different preferences, for example some preferences are associated with larger margins between responses, or they rely on noisy margin information derived from ratings. We argue that modeling the strength of preferences can lead to better generalization and more faithful alignment. Furthermore, many existing methods that use adaptive margins assume access to accurate preference scores, which can be difficult for humans to provide reliably. We propose an approach that leverages preferences over preferences, that is annotations indicating which of two preferences reflects a stronger distinction. We use this ordinal signal to infer adaptive margins on a per-datapoint basis. We introduce an extension to Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), DPO-PoP, that incorporates adaptive margins from preference-over-preference supervision, enabling improved discriminative and generative performance. Empirically, our method outperforms vanilla DPO, DPO with fixed margins, and DPO with ground-truth margins on the UltraFeedback dataset. Additionally, we show that there is a tradeoff between discriminative and generative performance: improving test classification accuracy, particularly by correctly labeling weaker preferences at the expense of stronger ones, can lead to a decline in generative quality. To navigate this tradeoff, we propose two sampling strategies to gather preference-over-preference labels: one favoring discriminative performance and one favoring generative performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking KL Regularization in RLHF: From Value Estimation to Gradient Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01555v2)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) leverages a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence loss to stabilize training and prevent overfitting. However, in methods such as GRPO, its implementation may be guided by principles from numerical value estimation-a practice that overlooks the term's functional role as an optimization loss. To analyze this issue, we establish a unified framework that connects two seemingly distinct implementation styles: using the mathematical term $k_n$ as a detached coefficient for the policy's score function ('$k_n$ in reward') or as a direct loss function through which gradients are propagated ('$k_n$ as loss'). We show that the latter can always be analyzed via an equivalent gradient coefficient in the former, unifying the two perspectives. Through this framework, we prove that the conventional '$k_1$ in reward' (like in PPO) is the principled loss for Reverse KL (RKL) regularization. We further establish a key finding: under on-policy conditions, the '$k_2$ as loss' formulation is, in fact, gradient-equivalent to '$k_1$ in reward'. This equivalence, first proven in our work, identifies both as the theoretically sound implementations of the RKL objective. In contrast, we show that the recently adopted '$k_3$ as loss' (like in GRPO) is merely a first-order, biased approximation of the principled loss. Furthermore, we argue that common off-policy implementations of '$k_n$ as loss' methods are biased due to neglected importance sampling, and we propose a principled correction. Our findings provide a comprehensive, gradient-based rationale for choosing and correctly implementing KL regularization, paving the way for more robust and effective RLHF systems.</p></details> |  |

Achieving an appropriate balance between enhancing the utility of model outputs and mitigating their potential for harm is a complex and persistent challenge. Contemporary approaches frequently formalize this problem within the framework of Constrained Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs) and employ established CMDP optimization techniques. However, these methods exhibit two notable limitations. First, their reliance on reward and cost functions renders performance highly sensitive to the underlying scoring mechanism, which must capture semantic meaning rather than being triggered by superficial keywords. Second, CMDP-based training entails tuning dual-variable, a process that is both computationally expensive and does not provide any provable safety guarantee for a fixed dual variable that can be exploitable through adversarial jailbreaks. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Certifiable Safe-RLHF (CS-RLHF) that introduces a cost model trained on a large-scale corpus to assign semantically grounded safety scores. In contrast to the lagrangian-based approach, CS-RLHF adopts a rectified penalty-based formulation. This design draws on the theory of exact penalty functions in constrained optimization, wherein constraint satisfaction is enforced directly through a suitably chosen penalty term. With an appropriately scaled penalty, feasibility of the safety constraints can be guaranteed at the optimizer, eliminating the need for dual-variable updates. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that CS-RLHF outperforms state-of-the-art LLM model responses rendering at-least 5 times efficient against nominal and jail-breaking prompts</p></details> |  |
| **[Understanding the Performance Gap in Preference Learning: A Dichotomy of RLHF and DPO](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19770v2)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a fine-grained theoretical analysis of the performance gap between reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and direct preference optimization (DPO) under a representation gap. Our study decomposes this gap into two sources: an explicit representation gap under exact optimization and an implicit representation gap under finite samples. In the exact optimization setting, we characterize how the relative capacities of the reward and policy model classes influence the final policy qualities. We show that RLHF, DPO, or online DPO can outperform one another depending on type of model mis-specifications. Notably, online DPO can outperform both RLHF and standard DPO when the reward and policy model classes are isomorphic and both mis-specified. In the approximate optimization setting, we provide a concrete construction where the ground-truth reward is implicitly sparse and show that RLHF requires significantly fewer samples than DPO to recover an effective reward model -- highlighting a statistical advantage of two-stage learning. Together, these results provide a comprehensive understanding of the performance gap between RLHF and DPO under various settings, and offer practical insights into when each method is preferred.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 5 figures.

However, its training pipeline suffers from substantial inefficiencies due to sequential multi-model dependencies (e.g., reward model depends on actor outputs) and long-tail response lengths, where a few long responses straggle the stage completion. We present OPPO, a novel, lightweight, and model-agnostic PPO-based RLHF framework that improves training efficiency by overlapping pipeline execution. OPPO introduces two novel techniques: (1) Intra-step overlap, which streams upstream model outputs (e.g., actor model) in right-sized chunks, enabling the downstream model (e.g., reward) to begin prefill while the upstream continues decoding; and (2) Inter-step overlap, which adaptively overcommits a few prompts and defers long generations to future steps, mitigating tail latency without discarding partial work. OPPO integrates easily with existing PPO implementations with a few lines of code change. Extensive evaluations show that OPPO accelerates PPO-based RLHF training by $1.8 \times-2.8 \times$ and improves GPU utilization by $1.4 \times-2.1 \times$ without compromising training convergence.</p></details> | <details><summary>Kaizh...</summary><p>Kaizhuo Yan and Yingjie Yu contributed equally to this work</p></details> |

We propose a mechanistic interpretability framework that identifies specialized neural circuits responsible for rare-event processing in reward models. Drawing from recent advances showing distributed specialization for rare tokens in language models\citep{liu2025no, liu2025emergent}, we hypothesize that reward models also develop functionally distinct circuits for longtail scenarios. Our theoretical framework establishes formal connections between circuit specialization, reward generalization bounds, and longtail performance. We introduce \textbf{Circuit-Aware Reward Training (CART)}, which uses circuit analysis to guide data augmentation, regularization, and ensemble strategies. This approach provides both theoretical insights into reward model failures and practical interventions for improving longtail robustness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reward Model Overoptimisation in Iterated RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18126v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is a widely used method for aligning large language models with human preferences. However, RLHF often suffers from reward model overoptimisation, in which models overfit to the reward function, resulting in non-generalisable policies that exploit the idiosyncrasies and peculiarities of the reward function. A common mitigation is iterated RLHF, in which reward models are repeatedly retrained with updated human feedback and policies are re-optimised. Despite its increasing adoption, the dynamics of overoptimisation in this setting remain poorly understood. In this work, we present the first comprehensive study of overoptimisation in iterated RLHF. We systematically analyse key design choices - how reward model training data is transferred across iterations, which reward function is used for optimisation, and how policies are initialised. Using the controlled AlpacaFarm benchmark, we observe that overoptimisation tends to decrease over successive iterations, as reward models increasingly approximate ground-truth preferences. However, performance gains diminish over time, and while reinitialising from the base policy is robust, it limits optimisation flexibility. Other initialisation strategies often fail to recover from early overoptimisation. These findings offer actionable insights for building more stable and generalisable RLHF pipelines.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 17 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

This paper studies the setting of online RLHF and focus on improving sample efficiency. All existing algorithms in online RLHF, whether doing passive exploration or active exploration, suffer from a sample complexity that scales exponentially with the scale of the reward function. This fundamental limitation hinders their effectiveness in scenarios with heavily skewed preferences, e.g. questions with a unique correct solution. To address this, we introduce Self-Exploring Preference-Incentive Online Preference Optimization (SE-POPO), an online RLHF algorithm that for the first time achieves a sample complexity that scales polynomially with the reward scale, answering an open problem raised by Xie et al. (2024).. Theoretically, we demonstrate that the sample complexity of SE-POPO dominates that of existing exploration algorithms. Empirically, our systematic evaluation confirms that SE-POPO is more sample-efficient than both exploratory and non-exploratory baselines, in two primary application scenarios of RLHF as well as on public benchmarks, marking a significant step forward in RLHF algorithm design. The code is available at https://github.com/MYC000801/SE-POPO.</p></details> |  |

We observe that expressions of satisfaction and dissatisfaction follow stable linguistic patterns across users, indicating that more informative supervisory signals can be extracted from free-form feedback. Building on this insight, we introduce Adaptive Reward-Following (ARF), which converts natural feedback into continuous preference trajectories and optimizes them using the novel TraceBias algorithm. Across diverse LLMs and preference domains, ARF consistently outperforms PPO and DPO, improving alignment by up to 7.6%. Our results demonstrate that continuous reward modeling provides a scalable path toward personalized and theoretically grounded RLHF.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This version adds several baselines and experiments, clarifies some ambiguous descriptions, and corrects the reported value for the ReScore result on the ALPACA task to 7.8%</p></details> |

Motivated by SimPO's strong performance in offline preference optimization, we investigate whether Maximum Entropy RL can achieve similar results in online RLHF settings. Our experiments find that Maximum Entropy RL consistently exhibits overoptimization and unstable KL dynamics, even at very low learning rates. Unlike KL-constrained methods that maintain stable training, entropy regularization fails to prevent reward hacking and appears to correlate with overoptimization. Lastly, we discuss possible explanations for why SimPO succeeds in offline settings while Maximum Entropy RL struggles in online scenarios. Our findings suggest that reference-free approaches may face distinct challenges when applied to online or offline preference learning.</p></details> | 26 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Opal: An Operator Algebra View of RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11298v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Opal, an operator view of reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Objectives are expressed as ladders of two primitives on a base utility: additive penalties and multiplicative pairwise weights. We describe a simple reduction law with if-and-only-if conditions: such ladders collapse to a normal form on pairwise margins when the reference is fixed, penalties are additive, and weights are independent of intermediate margins. When these assumptions do not hold (reference shift, non-additive gates, score-dependent weights), small examples demonstrate non-reducibility. Building on this view, we introduce GKPO (Generalized Kernel Preference Object), a canonical schema in which many RLHF methods can be represented and, when reducible, mapped back from. GKPO provides a standard JSON serialization, canonicalization and hashing rules, and explicit flags with finite witnesses when assumptions fail. We illustrate these ideas with GKPO examples for DPO, RRHF, and ORPO, along with cross-method conversions (where assumptions permit) and minimal stress tests (SHIFT/GATE/SCORE) that highlight non-reducibility. A lightweight Python reference library accompanies the schema, implementing canonical hashing and adapters for DPO and RRHF.</p></details> | 11 pages main |

The state-of-the-art, MaxMin-RLHF, addresses this by learning group-specific reward models, and by optimizing for the group receiving the minimum reward, thereby promoting fairness. However, we identify that a key limitation of MaxMin-RLHF is its poor performance when the minimum-reward group is a minority. To mitigate this drawback, we introduce a novel framework, termed {\em SharedRep-RLHF}. At its core, SharedRep-RLHF learns and leverages {\em shared traits} in annotations among various groups, in contrast to learning separate reward models across groups. We first show that MaxMin-RLHF is provably suboptimal in learning shared traits, and then quantify the sample complexity of SharedRep-RLHF. Experiments across diverse natural language tasks showcase the effectiveness of SharedRep-RLHF compared to MaxMin-RLHF with a gain of up to 20% in win rate.</p></details> |  |
| **[Balanced Actor Initialization: Stable RLHF Training of Distillation-Based Reasoning Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00309v1)** | 2025-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of alignment and reasoning capabilities in large language models has seen remarkable progress through two paradigms: instruction tuning and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) alignment paradigm, and distillation-based reasoning fine-tuning paradigm. While both approaches prove effective independently, the third paradigm of applying RLHF to distillation-trained models presents significant challenges. Our investigation reveals two critical phenomena that emerge in this paradigm: Sequence Length Collapse, where language generation dramatically reduces during early RLHF training, and the Reward Hockey Stick Curve, featuring severe reward score drops followed by gradual recovery. These instabilities fundamentally compromise the model's alignment and reasoning capabilities. To address these challenges, we propose Balanced Actor Initialization (BAI), a two-stage weighted model merging approach. BAI first merges instruction-following and distillation-based reasoning fine-tuned models, then further combines this intermediate model with the pretrained model to preserve foundational knowledge. Through comprehensive experiments across diverse benchmarks and detailed analysis of training experiments, we demonstrate that BAI resolves Sequence Length Collapse, mitigates the Reward Hockey Stick Curve, and enables continuous sequence length improvement during training. Additionally, our analysis reveals that balanced merging ratios achieve optimal trade-offs between training stability and reasoning capability preservation. Our work provides the effective solution for stable training in this third paradigm, enabling more capable reasoning models that combine distillation efficiency with RLHF alignment.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Algorithmic Bias of Aligning Large Language Models with RLHF: Preference Collapse and Matching Regularization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16455v2)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences is crucial for informing fair, economically sound, and statistically efficient decision-making processes. However, we argue that the predominant approach for aligning LLMs with human preferences through a reward model -- reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) -- suffers from an inherent algorithmic bias due to its Kullback--Leibler-based regularization in optimization. In extreme cases, this bias could lead to a phenomenon we term preference collapse, where minority preferences are virtually disregarded. To mitigate this algorithmic bias, we introduce preference matching (PM) RLHF, a novel approach that provably aligns LLMs with the preference distribution of the reward model under the Bradley--Terry--Luce/Plackett--Luce model. Central to our approach is a PM regularizer that takes the form of the negative logarithm of the LLM's policy probability distribution over responses, which helps the LLM balance response diversification and reward maximization. Notably, we obtain this regularizer by solving an ordinary differential equation that is necessary for the PM property. For practical implementation, we introduce a conditional variant of PM RLHF that is tailored to natural language generation. Finally, we empirically validate the effectiveness of conditional PM RLHF through experiments on the OPT and Llama-family models, demonstrating a 29% to 41% improvement in alignment with human preferences, as measured by a certain metric, compared to standard RLHF.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the Journal of the American Statistical Association</p></details> |

PPO performs well empirically but has a heuristic motivation and handles the KL-divergence constraint used in LM-RLHF in an ad-hoc manner. In this paper, we develop a a new action-value RL method for the LM-RLHF setting, KL-regularised Q-Learning (KLQ). We then show that our method is equivalent to a version of PPO in a certain specific sense, despite its very different motivation. Finally, we benchmark KLQ on two key language generation tasks -- summarisation and single-turn dialogue. We demonstrate that KLQ performs on-par with PPO at optimising the LM-RLHF objective, and achieves a consistently higher win-rate against PPO on LLM-as-a-judge evaluations.</p></details> |  |
| **[RLHF Fine-Tuning of LLMs for Alignment with Implicit User Feedback in Conversational Recommenders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05289v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conversational recommender systems (CRS) based on Large Language Models (LLMs) need to constantly be aligned to the user preferences to provide satisfying and context-relevant item recommendations. The traditional supervised fine-tuning cannot capture the implicit feedback signal, e.g., dwell time, sentiment polarity, or engagement patterns. In this paper, we share a fine-tuning solution using human feedback reinforcement learning (RLHF) to maximize implied user feedback (IUF) in a multi-turn recommendation context. We specify a reward model $R_{\phi}$ learnt on weakly-labelled engagement information and maximize user-centric utility by optimizing the foundational LLM M_{\theta} through a proximal policy optimization (PPO) approach. The architecture models conversational state transitions $s_t \to a_t \to s_{t +1}$, where the action $a_t$ is associated with LLM-generated item suggestions only on condition of conversation history in the past. The evaluation across synthetic and real-world datasets (e.g.REDIAL, OpenDialKG) demonstrates that our RLHF-fine-tuned models can perform better in terms of top-$k$ recommendation accuracy, coherence, and user satisfaction compared to (arrow-zero-cmwrquca-teja-falset ensuite 2Round group-deca States penalty give up This paper shows that implicit signal alignment can be efficient in achieving scalable and user-adaptive design of CRS.</p></details> |  |

While state-of-the-art applications like ChatGPT or GPT-4 commonly employ Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), the inclusion of a critic network introduces significant computational overhead. REINFORCE-based methods, such as REINFORCE Leave One-Out (RLOO), ReMax, and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), address this limitation by eliminating the critic network. However, these approaches face challenges in accurate advantage estimation. Specifically, they estimate advantages independently for responses to each prompt, which can lead to overfitting on simpler prompts and vulnerability to reward hacking and may be biased. To address these challenges, we introduce REINFORCE++, a novel approach that removes the critic model while using the global advantage normalization which is unbiased to improve the training stability. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that REINFORCE++ exhibits robust performance across various reward models without requiring prompt set truncation. Furthermore, it achieves superior generalization in both RLHF and long chain-of-thought (CoT) settings compared to existing REINFORCE-based methods. The implementation is available at https://github.com/OpenRLHF/OpenRLHF.</p></details> | add experiments |

While existing RLHF training systems have enabled significant progress, they often face challenges in scaling to multi-modal and diffusion workflows and adapting to dynamic workloads. In particular, current approaches may encounter limitations in controller scalability, flexible resource placement, and efficient orchestration when handling complex RLHF pipelines, especially in scenarios involving dynamic sampling or generative reward modeling. In this paper, we present \textbf{G-Core}, a simple, scalable, and balanced RLHF training framework designed to address these challenges. G-Core introduces a parallel controller programming model, enabling flexible and efficient orchestration of complex RLHF workflows without the bottlenecks of a single centralized controller. Furthermore, we propose a dynamic placement schema that adaptively partitions resources and schedules workloads, significantly reducing hardware idle time and improving utilization, even under highly variable training conditions. G-Core has successfully trained models that support WeChat product features serving a large-scale user base, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness in real-world scenarios.

Traditional approaches often rely on external classifiers, which can introduce inconsistencies with the core generative Large Language Models (LLMs). This paper introduces Self-Aware LLM for Unanswerability (SALU), a novel approach that deeply integrates unanswerability detection directly within the LLM's generative process. SALU is trained using a multi-task learning framework for both standard Question Answering (QA) and explicit abstention generation for unanswerable queries. Crucially, it incorporates a confidence-score-guided reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) phase, which explicitly penalizes hallucinated responses and rewards appropriate abstentions, fostering intrinsic self-awareness of knowledge boundaries. Through extensive experiments on our custom-built C-IR_Answerability dataset, SALU consistently outperforms strong baselines, including hybrid LLM-classifier systems, in overall accuracy for correctly answering or abstaining from questions. Human evaluation further confirms SALU's superior reliability, achieving high scores in factuality, appropriate abstention, and, most importantly, a dramatic reduction in hallucination, demonstrating its ability to robustly "know when to say 'I don't know'."</p></details> |  |

Traditional RLHF approaches rely on a fixed dataset, which often suffers from limited coverage. To this end, online RLHF has emerged as a promising direction, enabling iterative data collection and model improvement. Despite its potential, this paradigm faces a key bottleneck: the requirement to continuously integrate new data into the historical dataset and re-optimize the model from scratch at each iteration, resulting in computational and storage costs that grow linearly with the number of iterations. In this work, we address this challenge by proposing a one-pass reward modeling method that does not require storing the historical data and can be computed in constant time. Specifically, we first formalize RLHF as a contextual preference bandit problem and design an online mirror descent algorithm with a tailored local norm to replace the standard maximum likelihood estimation for reward modeling. We then apply our method to various online RLHF settings, including passive data collection, active data collection, and deployment-time adaptation. We provide theoretical guarantees showing that our method improves both statistical and computational efficiency. Finally, we provide practical algorithms and conduct experiments using Llama-3-8B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct models on the Ultrafeedback-binarized and Mixture2 datasets, validating the effectiveness of our proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first two authors contributed equally</p></details> |
| **[Accelerating RLHF Training with Reward Variance Increase](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23247v2)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is an essential technique for ensuring that large language models (LLMs) are aligned with human values and preferences during the post-training phase. As an effective RLHF approach, group relative policy optimization (GRPO) has demonstrated success in many LLM-based applications. However, efficient GRPO-based RLHF training remains a challenge. Recent studies reveal that a higher reward variance of the initial policy model leads to faster RLHF training. Inspired by this finding, we propose a practical reward adjustment model to accelerate RLHF training by provably increasing the reward variance and preserving the relative preferences and reward expectation. Our reward adjustment method inherently poses a nonconvex optimization problem, which is NP-hard to solve in general. To overcome the computational challenges, we design a novel $O(n \log n)$ algorithm to find a global solution of the nonconvex reward adjustment model by explicitly characterizing the extreme points of the feasible set. As an important application, we naturally integrate this reward adjustment model into the GRPO algorithm, leading to a more efficient GRPO with reward variance increase (GRPOVI) algorithm for RLHF training. As an interesting byproduct, we provide an indirect explanation for the empirical effectiveness of GRPO with rule-based reward for RLHF training, as demonstrated in DeepSeek-R1. Experiment results demonstrate that the GRPOVI algorithm can significantly improve the RLHF training efficiency compared to the original GRPO algorithm.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reward Shaping to Mitigate Reward Hacking in RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18770v3)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is essential for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values. However, RLHF is susceptible to \emph{reward hacking}, where the agent exploits flaws in the reward function rather than learning the intended behavior, thus degrading alignment. Although reward shaping helps stabilize RLHF and partially mitigate reward hacking, a systematic investigation into shaping techniques and their underlying principles remains lacking. To bridge this gap, we present a comprehensive study of the prevalent reward shaping methods. Our analysis suggests two key design principles: (1) the RL reward should be bounded, and (2) the RL reward benefits from rapid initial growth followed by gradual convergence. Guided by these insights, we propose Preference As Reward (PAR), a novel approach that leverages the latent preferences embedded within the reward model as the signal for reinforcement learning. We evaluated PAR on two base models, Gemma2-2B, and Llama3-8B, using two datasets, Ultrafeedback-Binarized and HH-RLHF. Experimental results demonstrate PAR's superior performance over other reward shaping methods. On the AlpacaEval 2.0 benchmark, PAR achieves a win rate of at least 5 percentage points higher than competing approaches. Furthermore, PAR exhibits remarkable data efficiency, requiring only a single reference reward for optimal performance, and maintains robustness against reward hacking even after two full epochs of training.

| **[Theoretical Tensions in RLHF: Reconciling Empirical Success with Inconsistencies in Social Choice Theory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12350v1)** | 2025-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite its empirical success, Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has been shown to violate almost all the fundamental axioms in social choice theory -- such as majority consistency, pairwise majority consistency, and Condorcet consistency. This raises a foundational question: why does RLHF perform so well in practice if it fails these seemingly essential properties? In this paper, we resolve this paradox by showing that under mild and empirically plausible assumptions on the preference profile, RLHF does satisfy pairwise majority and Condorcet consistency. These assumptions are frequently satisfied in real-world alignment tasks, offering a theoretical explanation for RLHF's strong practical performance. Furthermore, we show that a slight modification to the reward modeling objective can ensure pairwise majority or Condorcet consistency even under general preference profiles, thereby improving the alignment process. Finally, we go beyond classical axioms in economic and social choice theory and introduce new alignment criteria -- preference matching, preference equivalence, and group preference matching -- that better reflect the goal of learning distributions over responses. We show that while RLHF satisfies the first two properties, it fails to satisfy the third. We conclude by discussing how future alignment methods may be designed to satisfy all three.</p></details> |  |
| **[RLHS: Mitigating Misalignment in RLHF with Hindsight Simulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08617v3)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has shown promise in aligning generative AI, we present empirical evidence that it can also cause severe, systematic misalignment. We hypothesize that this stems from evaluator feedback depending on downstream outcome predictions (foresight) that can be influenced by the AI's output, inducing Goodhart's law dynamics. We present a theoretical analysis showing that conditioning evaluator feedback on downstream observations (hindsight) inhibits this effect by decoupling the alignment signal from potentially compromised predictions--crucially, the result holds even if the observed outcomes are sampled from the AI's own world model. Building on this insight, we introduce Reinforcement Learning from Hindsight Simulation (RLHS), which presents plausible simulated outcomes to evaluators before eliciting feedback. We validate RLHS across three consultancy settings--marketplace interactions, restaurant recommendations, and online course advising--using both online (PPO) and offline (DPO) fine-tuning methods, and show that it substantially improves alignment over RLHF in experiments and human evaluations. We perform post-hoc benchmark evaluations on TruthfulQA, HaluEval, and TrustLLM, finding that even after single-task fine-tuning, RLHF misalignment persists, whereas RLHS consistently outperforms baselines and demonstrates robust alignment generalization.

| **[Active Preference Optimization for Sample Efficient RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10500v3)** | 2025-06-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) aligned using Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) have shown remarkable generation abilities in numerous tasks. However, collecting high-quality human preferences creates costly bottlenecks in practical deployments, and hence, training data are often budgeted. In these scenarios, it is crucial to collect training data (e.g., contexts, a pair of generations for each context, and a preference indicating which generation is better) carefully, yet most of the existing methods sample contexts uniformly at random from a given collection. Given this, under the Bradley-Terry-Luce preference model and with a small budget of training data, we show that uniform sampling of contexts could lead to a policy (i.e., an aligned model) that suffers a constant sub-optimality gap from the optimal policy. This highlights the need for an adaptive context sampling strategy for effective alignment under a small sample budget. To address this, we reformulate RLHF within the contextual preference bandit framework, treating generations as actions, and give a nearly complete characterization of the sub-optimality gap in terms of both lower and upper bounds. First, when the action set is a $d$-dimensional hypercube and the number of samples is $T$, we show an $\Omega(d/\sqrt{T})$ lower bound. Next, we propose an algorithm, $\textit{Active Preference Optimization}$ ($\texttt{APO}$), that iteratively collects preferences for the most uncertain contexts. We show that the sub-optimality gap of the policy learned via $\texttt{APO}$ matches the lower bound up to a log factor and a non-linearity constant. Finally, we perform experiments on practical datasets to validate $\texttt{APO}$'s efficacy over existing methods, establishing it as a sample-efficient and cost-effective solution for LLM alignment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ECML-PKDD 2025.

| **[Policy Filtration for RLHF to Mitigate Noise in Reward Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06957v5)** | 2025-06-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While direct policy optimization methods exist, pioneering LLMs are fine-tuned with reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to generate better responses under the supervision of a reward model learned from preference data. One major challenge of RLHF is the inaccuracy of the intermediate reward model, especially in the tasks that requires complex reasoning for the reward model to score a response. We find that the reliability of the reward model varies across responses assigned with different rewards. This motivates us to filter the samples whose rewards may be unreliable to improve the signal-to-noise ratio during policy learning, resulting in Policy Filtration for Proximal Policy Optimization (PF-PPO). To choose a proper policy filtering strategy, we use the coefficient of determination (R2) between the rewards and actual scores on filtered samples as the metrics to help us find promising strategies since it measures how well the rewards filtered by PF-PPO indicate real performance. We provide extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of PF-PPO in code generation and math reasoning tasks. In code generation, PF-PPO achieves the state-of-the-art performance of 7-billion-parameter models on HumanEval (+7.9%), MBPP (+0.7%), and LeetCode Contest (+10.0%) which is a more challenging benchmark created by us. In math reasoning, PF-PPO yields performance increase using different reward models and benchmarks (Ape210K and CMATH).

| **[BadReward: Clean-Label Poisoning of Reward Models in Text-to-Image RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03234v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is crucial for aligning text-to-image (T2I) models with human preferences. However, RLHF's feedback mechanism also opens new pathways for adversaries. This paper demonstrates the feasibility of hijacking T2I models by poisoning a small fraction of preference data with natural-appearing examples. Specifically, we propose BadReward, a stealthy clean-label poisoning attack targeting the reward model in multi-modal RLHF. BadReward operates by inducing feature collisions between visually contradicted preference data instances, thereby corrupting the reward model and indirectly compromising the T2I model's integrity. Unlike existing alignment poisoning techniques focused on single (text) modality, BadReward is independent of the preference annotation process, enhancing its stealth and practical threat. Extensive experiments on popular T2I models show that BadReward can consistently guide the generation towards improper outputs, such as biased or violent imagery, for targeted concepts. Our findings underscore the amplified threat landscape for RLHF in multi-modal systems, highlighting the urgent need for robust defenses. Disclaimer.

| **[The Energy Loss Phenomenon in RLHF: A New Perspective on Mitigating Reward Hacking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19358v3)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work identifies the Energy Loss Phenomenon in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and its connection to reward hacking. Specifically, energy loss in the final layer of a Large Language Model (LLM) gradually increases during the RL process, with an excessive increase in energy loss characterizing reward hacking. Beyond empirical analysis, we further provide a theoretical foundation by proving that, under mild conditions, the increased energy loss reduces the upper bound of contextual relevance in LLMs, which is a critical aspect of reward hacking as the reduced contextual relevance typically indicates overfitting to reward model-favored patterns in RL. To address this issue, we propose an Energy loss-aware PPO algorithm (EPPO) which penalizes the increase in energy loss in the LLM's final layer during reward calculation to prevent excessive energy loss, thereby mitigating reward hacking. We theoretically show that EPPO can be conceptually interpreted as an entropy-regularized RL algorithm, which provides deeper insights into its effectiveness. Extensive experiments across various LLMs and tasks demonstrate the commonality of the energy loss phenomenon, as well as the effectiveness of EPPO in mitigating reward hacking and improving RLHF performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper has been accepted by ICML 2025</p></details> |
| **[A Descriptive and Normative Theory of Human Beliefs in RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01692v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human preferences in RLHF are typically modeled as a function of the human's reward function or corresponding optimal state-action values. In this work, we propose that human beliefs about the capabilities of the agent being trained also play a key role in preference generation. We examine two questions related to this hypothesis, one descriptive and one normative, respectively: Do human labelers' beliefs about agent capabilities affect the preferences that they provide? And what is the ideal set of beliefs about an agent -- and resulting preferences -- for humans to have? We propose a new preference model that incorporates human beliefs and provide a normative theory that bounds the error on the final learned policy based on the \textit{mismatch} between the human's beliefs and an idealized set of beliefs. We then confirm via a human study that beliefs about agent capabilities do, in fact, significantly affect preferences and can be influenced through simple interventions. Additionally, we empirically show through synthetic experiments that it is often suboptimal for human preference labelers to assume agent optimality. Collectively, these results theoretically and empirically demonstrate how reducing the mismatch between human beliefs and agent capabilities can lead to more performant RLHF and point toward new best practices for RLHF practitioners.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we consider the online RLHF setting where the preference data is revealed during the learning process and study action value function approximation. We design a model-free posterior sampling algorithm for online RLHF inspired by Thompson sampling and provide its theoretical guarantee. Specifically, we adopt Bellman eluder (BE) dimension as the complexity measure of the function class and establish $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret bound for the proposed algorithm with other multiplicative factor depending on the horizon, BE dimension and the $log$-bracketing number of the function class. Further, in the analysis, we first establish the concentration-type inequality of the squared Bellman error bound based on the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) generalization bound, which plays the crucial rules in obtaining the eluder-type regret bound and may be of independent interest.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Reward Fairness in RLHF: From a Resource Allocation Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23349v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rewards serve as proxies for human preferences and play a crucial role in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). However, if these rewards are inherently imperfect, exhibiting various biases, they can adversely affect the alignment of large language models (LLMs). In this paper, we collectively define the various biases present in rewards as the problem of reward unfairness. We propose a bias-agnostic method to address the issue of reward fairness from a resource allocation perspective, without specifically designing for each type of bias, yet effectively mitigating them. Specifically, we model preference learning as a resource allocation problem, treating rewards as resources to be allocated while considering the trade-off between utility and fairness in their distribution. We propose two methods, Fairness Regularization and Fairness Coefficient, to achieve fairness in rewards. We apply our methods in both verification and reinforcement learning scenarios to obtain a fairness reward model and a policy model, respectively. Experiments conducted in these scenarios demonstrate that our approach aligns LLMs with human preferences in a more fair manner.</p></details> | Accepted to ACL 2025 |
| **[Reward Generalization in RLHF: A Topological Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10184v7)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing alignment methods share a common topology of information flow, where reward information is collected from humans, modeled with preference learning, and used to tune language models. However, this shared topology has not been systematically characterized, nor have its alternatives been thoroughly explored, leaving the problems of low data efficiency and unreliable generalization unaddressed. As a solution, we introduce a theory of reward generalization in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), focusing on the topology of information flow at both macro and micro levels. At the macro level, we portray the RLHF information flow as an autoencoding process over behavior distributions, formalizing the RLHF objective of distributional consistency between human preference and model behavior. At the micro level, we present induced Bayesian networks to model the impact of dataset topologies on reward generalization. Combining analysis on both levels, we propose reward modeling from tree-structured preference information. It is shown to reduce reward uncertainty by up to $\Theta(\log n/\log\log n)$ times compared to baselines, where $n$ is the dataset size. Validation on three NLP tasks shows that it achieves an average win rate of 65% against baselines, thus improving reward generalization for free via topology design, while reducing the amount of data requiring annotation.</p></details> | <details><summary>46 pa...</summary><p>46 pages, ACL 2025 (Findings)</p></details> |
| **[Learning a Pessimistic Reward Model in RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20556v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work proposes `PET', a novel pessimistic reward fine-tuning method, to learn a pessimistic reward model robust against reward hacking in offline reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Traditional reward modeling techniques in RLHF train an imperfect reward model, on which a KL regularization plays a pivotal role in mitigating reward hacking when optimizing a policy. Such an intuition-based method still suffers from reward hacking, and the policies with large KL divergence from the dataset distribution are excluded during learning. In contrast, we show that when optimizing a policy on a pessimistic reward model fine-tuned through PET, reward hacking can be prevented without relying on any regularization. We test our methods on the standard TL;DR summarization dataset. We find that one can learn a high-quality policy on our pessimistic reward without using any regularization. Such a policy has a high KL divergence from the dataset distribution while having high performance in practice. In summary, our work shows the feasibility of learning a pessimistic reward model against reward hacking. The agent can greedily search for the policy with a high pessimistic reward without suffering from reward hacking.</p></details> |  |
| **[SCAR: Shapley Credit Assignment for More Efficient RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20417v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is a widely used technique for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences, yet it often suffers from sparse reward signals, making effective credit assignment challenging. In typical setups, the reward model provides a single scalar score for an entire generated sequence, offering little insight into which token or span-level decisions were responsible for the outcome. To address this, we propose Shapley Credit Assignment Rewards (SCAR), a novel method that leverages Shapley values in cooperative game theory. SCAR distributes the total sequence-level reward among constituent tokens or text spans based on their principled marginal contributions. This creates dense reward signals, crucially, without necessitating the training of auxiliary critique models or recourse to fine-grained human annotations at intermediate generation stages. Unlike prior dense reward methods, SCAR offers a game-theoretic foundation for fair credit attribution. Theoretically, we demonstrate that SCAR preserves the original optimal policy, and empirically, across diverse tasks including sentiment control, text summarization, and instruction tuning, we show that SCAR converges significantly faster and achieves higher final reward scores compared to standard RLHF and attention-based dense reward baselines. Our findings suggest that SCAR provides a more effective and theoretically sound method for credit assignment in RLHF, leading to more efficient alignment of LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[On The Global Convergence Of Online RLHF With Neural Parametrization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15610v2)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The importance of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values cannot be overstated. RLHF is a three-stage process that includes supervised fine-tuning (SFT), reward learning, and policy learning. Although there are several offline and online approaches to aligning LLMs, they often suffer from distribution shift issues. These issues arise from the inability to accurately capture the distributional interdependence between the reward learning and policy learning stages. Consequently, this has led to various approximated approaches, but the theoretical insights and motivations remain largely limited to tabular settings, which do not hold in practice. This gap between theoretical insights and practical implementations is critical. It is challenging to address this gap as it requires analyzing the performance of AI alignment algorithms in neural network-parameterized settings. Although bi-level formulations have shown promise in addressing distribution shift issues, they suffer from the hyper-gradient problem, and current approaches lack efficient algorithms to solve this. In this work, we tackle these challenges employing the bi-level formulation laid out in Kwon et al. (2024) along with the assumption \emph{Weak Gradient Domination} to demonstrate convergence in an RLHF setup, obtaining a sample complexity of $\epsilon^{-\frac{7}{2}}$ . Our key contributions are twofold: (i) We propose a bi-level formulation for AI alignment in parameterized settings and introduce a first-order approach to solve this problem. (ii) We analyze the theoretical convergence rates of the proposed algorithm and derive state-of-the-art bounds. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to establish convergence rate bounds and global optimality for the RLHF framework in neural network-parameterized settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>The u...</summary><p>The updated version of this paper is arXiv:2503.17644</p></details> |
| **[A Unified Theoretical Analysis of Private and Robust Offline Alignment: from RLHF to DPO](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15694v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we theoretically investigate the effects of noisy labels in offline alignment, with a focus on the interplay between privacy and robustness against adversarial corruption. Specifically, under linear modeling assumptions, we present a unified analysis covering both reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and direct preference optimization (DPO) under different privacy-corruption scenarios, such as Local differential privacy-then-Corruption (LTC), where human preference labels are privatized before being corrupted by an adversary, and Corruption-then-Local differential privacy (CTL), where labels are corrupted before privacy protection. Our analysis leverages a reduction framework that reduces the offline alignment problem under linear modeling assumptions to parameter estimation in logistic regression. This framework allows us to establish an interesting separation result between LTC and CTL, demonstrating that LTC presents a greater challenge than CTL in offline alignment, even under linear models. As important by-products, our findings also advance the state-of-the-art theoretical results in offline alignment under privacy-only or corruption-only scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[DPO Meets PPO: Reinforced Token Optimization for RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18922v4)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the classical Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) framework, Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is employed to learn from sparse, sentence-level rewards -- a challenging scenario in traditional deep reinforcement learning. Despite the great successes of PPO in the alignment of large language models, its open-source implementation is still largely sub-optimal. To address these issues, we introduce a framework that models RLHF problems as a Markov decision process (MDP), enabling the capture of fine-grained token-wise information. Under this framework, we introduce an algorithm Reinforced Token Optimization (\texttt{RTO}), which learns the token-wise reward function from preference data and performs policy optimization based on this learned token-wise reward signal. Theoretically, \texttt{RTO} is proven to have the capability of finding the near-optimal policy sample-efficiently. For its practical implementation, \texttt{RTO} innovatively integrates Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and PPO. DPO, originally derived from sparse sentence rewards, surprisingly provides us with a token-wise characterization of response quality, which is seamlessly incorporated into our subsequent PPO training stage. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \texttt{RTO} performs better than PPO and other direct preference learning algorithms. In particular, RTO outperforms PPO by 7.5 points on the AlpacaEval 2 benchmark and by 4.1 points on Arena-Hard. Our code and models are available at \href{https://github.com/zkshan2002/RTO}{https://github.com/zkshan2002/RTO}.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |
| **[Multi-Level Aware Preference Learning: Enhancing RLHF for Complex Multi-Instruction Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12845v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>RLHF has emerged as a predominant approach for aligning artificial intelligence systems with human preferences, demonstrating exceptional and measurable efficacy in instruction following tasks; however, it exhibits insufficient compliance capabilities when confronted with complex multi-instruction tasks. Conventional approaches rely heavily on human annotation or more sophisticated large language models, thereby introducing substantial resource expenditure or potential bias concerns. Meanwhile, alternative synthetic methods that augment standard preference datasets often compromise the model's semantic quality. Our research identifies a critical oversight in existing techniques, which predominantly focus on comparing responses while neglecting valuable latent signals embedded within prompt inputs, and which only focus on preference disparities at the intra-sample level, while neglecting to account for the inter-sample level preference differentials that exist among preference data. To leverage these previously neglected indicators, we propose a novel Multi-level Aware Preference Learning (MAPL) framework, capable of enhancing multi-instruction capabilities. Specifically, for any given response in original preference data pairs, we construct varied prompts with a preference relation under different conditions, in order to learn intra-sample level preference disparities. Furthermore, for any given original preference pair, we synthesize multi-instruction preference pairs to capture preference discrepancies at the inter-sample level. Building on the two datasets constructed above, we consequently devise two sophisticated training objective functions. Subsequently, our framework integrates seamlessly into both Reward Modeling and Direct Preference Optimization paradigms. Through rigorous evaluation across multiple benchmarks, we empirically validate the efficacy of our framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bias Fitting to Mitigate Length Bias of Reward Model in RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12843v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback relies on reward models to align large language models with human preferences. However, RLHF often suffers from reward hacking, wherein policy learning exploits flaws in the trained reward model to maximize reward scores without genuinely aligning with human preferences. A significant example of such reward hacking is length bias, where reward models usually favor longer responses irrespective of actual response quality. Previous works on length bias have notable limitations, these approaches either mitigate bias without characterizing the bias form, or simply assume a linear length-reward relation. To accurately model the intricate nature of length bias and facilitate more effective bias mitigation, we propose FiMi-RM (Bias Fitting to Mitigate Length Bias of Reward Model in RLHF), a framework that autonomously learns and corrects underlying bias patterns. Our approach consists of three stages: First, we train a standard reward model which inherently contains length bias. Next, we deploy a lightweight fitting model to explicitly capture the non-linear relation between length and reward. Finally, we incorporate this learned relation into the reward model to debias. Experimental results demonstrate that FiMi-RM achieves a more balanced length-reward distribution. Furthermore, when applied to alignment algorithms, our debiased reward model improves length-controlled win rate and reduces verbosity without compromising its performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Due t...</summary><p>Due to the word limit for arXiv abstract, the abstract here has been abridged compared to the one in the PDF</p></details> |
| **[Can RLHF be More Efficient with Imperfect Reward Models? A Policy Coverage Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19255v3)** | 2025-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sample efficiency is critical for online Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). While existing works investigate sample-efficient online exploration strategies, the potential of utilizing misspecified yet relevant reward models to accelerate learning remains underexplored. This paper studies how to transfer knowledge from those imperfect reward models in online RLHF. We start by identifying a novel property due to KL-regularization in the RLHF objective: \emph{a policy's coverability of the optimal policy is captured by its sub-optimality}. Building on this insight, we propose novel transfer learning principles and a theoretical algorithm -- \emph{\textbf{T}ransfer \textbf{P}olicy \textbf{O}ptimization (\textbf{TPO})} -- with provable benefits compared to standard online learning. Empirically, inspired by our theoretical findings, we develop a win-rate-based transfer policy selection strategy with improved computational efficiency. Moreover, our empirical transfer learning technique is modular and can be integrated with various policy optimization methods, such as DPO, IPO and XPO, to further enhance their performance. We validate the effectiveness of our method through experiments on summarization tasks.</p></details> | 36 Pages; ICML 2025 |
| **[Online Bandit Learning with Offline Preference Data for Improved RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09574v4)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) is at the core of fine-tuning methods for generative AI models for language and images. Such feedback is often sought as rank or preference feedback from human raters, as opposed to eliciting scores since the latter tends to be noisy. On the other hand, RL theory and algorithms predominantly assume that a reward feedback is available. In particular, approaches for online learning that can be helpful in adaptive data collection via active learning cannot incorporate offline preference data. In this paper, we adopt a finite-armed linear bandit model as a prototypical model of online learning. We consider an offline preference dataset to be available generated by an expert of unknown 'competence'. We propose warmPref-PS, a posterior sampling algorithm for online learning that can be warm-started with an offline dataset with noisy preference feedback. We show that by modeling the 'competence' of the expert that generated it, we are able to use such a dataset most effectively. We support our claims with novel theoretical analysis of its Bayesian regret, as well as, extensive empirical evaluation of an approximate loss function that optimizes for infinitely many arms, and performs substantially better than baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Policy-labeled Preference Learning: Is Preference Enough for RLHF?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06273v2)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To design rewards that align with human goals, Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a prominent technique for learning reward functions from human preferences and optimizing policies via reinforcement learning algorithms. However, existing RLHF methods often misinterpret trajectories as being generated by an optimal policy, causing inaccurate likelihood estimation and suboptimal learning. Inspired by Direct Preference Optimization framework which directly learns optimal policy without explicit reward, we propose policy-labeled preference learning (PPL), to resolve likelihood mismatch issues by modeling human preferences with regret, which reflects behavior policy information. We also provide a contrastive KL regularization, derived from regret-based principles, to enhance RLHF in sequential decision making. Experiments in high-dimensional continuous control tasks demonstrate PPL's significant improvements in offline RLHF performance and its effectiveness in online settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Asynchronous RLHF: Faster and More Efficient Off-Policy RL for Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18252v3)** | 2025-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The dominant paradigm for RLHF is online and on-policy RL: synchronously generating from the large language model (LLM) policy, labelling with a reward model, and learning using feedback on the LLM's own outputs. While performant, this paradigm is computationally inefficient. Inspired by classical deep RL literature, we propose separating generation and learning in RLHF. This enables asynchronous generation of new samples while simultaneously training on old samples, leading to faster training and more compute-optimal scaling. However, asynchronous training relies on an underexplored regime, online but off-policy RLHF: learning on samples from previous iterations of our model which give a worse training signal. We tackle the fundamental challenge in this regime: how much off-policyness can we tolerate for asynchronous training to speed up learning but maintain performance? Among several RLHF algorithms we test, online DPO is found to be most robust to off-policy data, and robustness increases with the scale of the policy model. We study further compute optimizations for asynchronous RLHF but find that they come at a performance cost, giving rise to a trade-off. We verify the scalability of asynchronous RLHF by training a general-purpose chatbot from LLaMA 3.1 8B on an instruction-following task ~40% faster than a synchronous run while matching final performance. Finally, we extend our results to math and reasoning to demonstrate asynchronous RL can finetune Rho 1B on GSM8k ~70% faster while matching synchronous accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted at ICLR 2025, code at https://github.com/mnoukhov/async_rlhf, integrated into the open-instruct library https://github.com/allenai/open-instruct</p></details> |
| **[ReaL: Efficient RLHF Training of Large Language Models with Parameter Reallocation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14088v2)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is a pivotal technique for empowering large language model (LLM) applications. Compared with the supervised training process of LLMs, the RLHF training process is much more sophisticated, requiring a diverse range of computation workloads with intricate dependencies between multiple LLM instances. Therefore, simply adopting the fixed parallelization strategies from supervised training for LLMs can be insufficient for RLHF and result in low training efficiency. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel technique named parameter ReaLlocation, which dynamically adapts the parallelization strategies for different workloads during training by redistributing LLM parameters across the training cluster. Building upon this idea, we introduce ReaL, a pioneering system for efficient RLHF training. ReaL introduces the concept of an execution plan, which defines a fine-grained resource allocation and parallelization strategy particularly designed for RLHF training. Based on this concept, ReaL employs a tailored search algorithm with a lightweight run-time estimator to automatically discover an efficient execution plan for an instance of RLHF experiment. Subsequently, the runtime engine deploys the selected plan by effectively parallelizing computations and redistributing parameters. We evaluate ReaL on the LLaMA models with up to 70 billion parameters and 128 GPUs. The experimental results demonstrate that ReaL achieves speedups of up to $3.58\times$ compared to baseline methods. Furthermore, the execution plans generated by ReaL exhibit an average of $81\%$ performance improvement over heuristic approaches based on Megatron-LM in the long-context scenario. The source code of ReaL is publicly available at https://github.com/openpsi-project/ReaLHF .</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages (20 pages with references and the appendix), 17 figures.

| **[Regressing the Relative Future: Efficient Policy Optimization for Multi-turn RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04612v2)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success at tasks like summarization that involve a single turn of interaction. However, they can still struggle with multi-turn tasks like dialogue that require long-term planning. Previous works on multi-turn dialogue extend single-turn reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) methods to the multi-turn setting by treating all prior dialogue turns as a long context. Such approaches suffer from covariate shift: the conversations in the training set have previous turns generated by some reference policy, which means that low training error may not necessarily correspond to good performance when the learner is actually in the conversation loop. In response, we introduce REgressing the RELative FUture (REFUEL), an efficient policy optimization approach designed to address multi-turn RLHF in LLMs. REFUEL employs a single model to estimate $Q$-values and trains on self-generated data, addressing the covariate shift issue. REFUEL frames the multi-turn RLHF problem as a sequence of regression tasks on iteratively collected datasets, enabling ease of implementation. Theoretically, we prove that REFUEL can match the performance of any policy covered by the training set. Empirically, we evaluate our algorithm by using Llama-3.1-70B-it to simulate a user in conversation with our model. REFUEL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods such as DPO and REBEL across various settings. Furthermore, despite having only 8 billion parameters, Llama-3-8B-it fine-tuned with REFUEL outperforms Llama-3.1-70B-it on long multi-turn dialogues. Implementation of REFUEL can be found at https://github.com/ZhaolinGao/REFUEL/, and models trained by REFUEL can be found at https://huggingface.co/Cornell-AGI.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimizing RLHF Training for Large Language Models with Stage Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13221v3)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present RLHFuse, an efficient training system with stage fusion for Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). Due to the intrinsic nature of RLHF training, i.e., the data skewness in the generation stage and the pipeline bubbles in the training stage, existing RLHF systems suffer from low GPU utilization. RLHFuse breaks the traditional view of RLHF workflow as a composition of individual tasks, splitting each task into finer-grained subtasks, and performing stage fusion to improve GPU utilization. RLHFuse contains two key ideas. First, for generation and inference tasks, RLHFuse splits them into sample-level subtasks, enabling efficient inter-stage fusion to overlap the execution of generation and inference stages, thus mitigating the original generation bottleneck dominated by long-tailed samples. Second, for training tasks, RLHFuse breaks them into subtasks of micro-batches and performs intra-stage fusion to concurrently execute these subtasks in the training stage with a fused pipeline schedule, effectively mitigating the pipeline bubbles. The experiments show that RLHFuse increases the training throughput by up to $3.7\times$, compared to existing systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Federated RLHF with Aggregated Client Preference for LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03038v3)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) fine-tunes a pretrained large language model (LLM) using user preference data, enabling it to generate content aligned with human preferences. However, due to privacy concerns, users may be reluctant to share sensitive preference data. To address this, we propose utilizing Federated Learning (FL) techniques, allowing large-scale preference collection from diverse real-world users without requiring them to transmit data to a central server. Our federated RLHF methods (i.e., FedBis and FedBiscuit) encode each client's preferences into binary selectors and aggregate them to capture common preferences. In particular, FedBiscuit overcomes key challenges, such as preference heterogeneity and reward hacking, through innovative solutions like grouping clients with similar preferences to reduce heterogeneity and using multiple binary selectors to enhance LLM output quality. To evaluate the performance of the proposed methods, we establish the first federated RLHF benchmark with a heterogeneous human preference dataset. Experimental results show that by integrating the LLM with aggregated client preferences, FedBis and FedBiscuit significantly enhance the professionalism and readability of the generated content.</p></details> | ICLR'25 |

However, existing reward models lack this ability, as they are typically trained by increasing the reward gap between chosen and rejected responses, while overlooking the prompts that the responses are conditioned on. Consequently, when the trained reward model is evaluated on prompt-response pairs that lie outside the data distribution, neglecting the effect of prompts may result in poor generalization of the reward model. To address this issue, we decompose the reward value into two independent components: prompt-free reward and prompt-related reward. Prompt-free reward represents the evaluation that is determined only by responses, while the prompt-related reward reflects the reward that derives from both the prompt and the response. We extract these two components from an information-theoretic perspective, which requires no extra models. Subsequently, we propose a new reward learning algorithm by prioritizing data samples based on their prompt-free reward values. Through toy examples, we demonstrate that the extracted prompt-free and prompt-related rewards effectively characterize two parts of the reward model. Further, standard evaluations show that our method improves both the alignment performance and the generalization capability of the reward model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Work ...</summary><p>Work done during internships at Institute of Artificial Intelligence (TeleAI), China Telecom</p></details> |
| **[A Unified Pairwise Framework for RLHF: Bridging Generative Reward Modeling and Policy Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04950v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a important paradigm for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences during post-training. This framework typically involves two stages: first, training a reward model on human preference data, followed by optimizing the language model using reinforcement learning algorithms. However, current RLHF approaches may constrained by two limitations. First, existing RLHF frameworks often rely on Bradley-Terry models to assign scalar rewards based on pairwise comparisons of individual responses. However, this approach imposes significant challenges on reward model (RM), as the inherent variability in prompt-response pairs across different contexts demands robust calibration capabilities from the RM. Second, reward models are typically initialized from generative foundation models, such as pre-trained or supervised fine-tuned models, despite the fact that reward models perform discriminative tasks, creating a mismatch. This paper introduces Pairwise-RL, a RLHF framework that addresses these challenges through a combination of generative reward modeling and a pairwise proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm. Pairwise-RL unifies reward model training and its application during reinforcement learning within a consistent pairwise paradigm, leveraging generative modeling techniques to enhance reward model performance and score calibration. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that Pairwise-RL outperforms traditional RLHF frameworks across both internal evaluation datasets and standard public benchmarks, underscoring its effectiveness in improving alignment and model behavior.</p></details> | 11oages,2 figures |
| **[UNA: Unifying Alignments of RLHF/PPO, DPO and KTO by a Generalized Implicit Reward Function](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15339v3)** | 2025-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An LLM is pretrained on trillions of tokens, but the pretrained LLM may still generate undesired responses. To solve this problem, alignment techniques such as RLHF, DPO and KTO are proposed. However, these alignment techniques have limitations. For example, RLHF requires training the reward model and policy separately, which is complex, time-consuming, memory intensive and unstable during training processes. DPO proposes a mapping between an optimal policy and a reward, greatly simplifying the training process of RLHF. However, it can not take full advantages of a reward model and it is limited to pairwise preference data. In this paper, we propose \textbf{UN}ified \textbf{A}lignment (UNA) which unifies RLHF/PPO, DPO and KTO. Firstly, we mathematically prove that given the classical RLHF objective, the optimal policy is induced by a generalize implicit reward function. With this novel mapping between a reward model and an optimal policy, UNA can 1. unify RLHF/PPO, DPO and KTO into a supervised learning of minimizing the difference between an implicit reward and an explicit reward; 2. outperform RLHF/PPO while simplify, stabilize, speed up and reduce memory burden of RL fine-tuning process; 3. accommodate different feedback types including pairwise, binary and scalar feedback. Downstream experiments show UNA outperforms DPO, KTO and RLHF.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sharpe Ratio-Guided Active Learning for Preference Optimization in RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22137v1)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has become a cornerstone of the training and alignment pipeline for large language models (LLMs). Recent advances, such as direct preference optimization (DPO), have simplified the preference learning step. However, collecting preference data remains a challenging and costly process, often requiring expert annotation. This cost can be mitigated by carefully selecting the data points presented for annotation. In this work, we propose an active learning approach to efficiently select prompt and preference pairs using a risk assessment strategy based on the Sharpe Ratio. To address the challenge of unknown preferences prior to annotation, our method evaluates the gradients of all potential preference annotations to assess their impact on model updates. These gradient-based evaluations enable risk assessment of data points regardless of the annotation outcome. By leveraging the DPO loss derivations, we derive a closed-form expression for computing these Sharpe ratios on a per-tuple basis, ensuring our approach remains both tractable and computationally efficient. We also introduce two variants of our method, each making different assumptions about prior information. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the baseline by up to 5% in win rates against the chosen completion with limited human preference data across several language models and real-world datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[One Framework to Rule Them All: Unifying RL-Based and RL-Free Methods in RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19523v2)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this article, we primarily examine a variety of RL-based and RL-free methods designed to address Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Large Reasoning Models (LRMs). We begin with a concise overview of the typical steps involved in RLHF and LRMs. Next, we reinterpret several RL-based and RL-free algorithms through the perspective of neural structured bandit prediction, providing a clear conceptual framework that uncovers a deeper connection between these seemingly distinct approaches. Following this, we briefly review some core principles of reinforcement learning, drawing attention to an often-overlooked aspect in existing RLHF studies. This leads to a detailed derivation of the standard RLHF objective within a full RL context, demonstrating its equivalence to neural structured bandit prediction. Finally, by reinvestigating the principles behind Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), we pinpoint areas needing adjustment, which culminates in the introduction of the Generalized Reinforce Optimization (GRO) framework, seamlessly integrating RL-based and RL-free methods in RLHF. We look forward to the community's efforts to empirically validate GRO and invite constructive feedback.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Shared Low-Rank Adaptation Approach to Personalized RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19201v1)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a pivotal technique for aligning artificial intelligence systems with human values, achieving remarkable success in fine-tuning large language models. However, existing RLHF frameworks often assume that human preferences are relatively homogeneous and can be captured by a single, unified reward model. This assumption overlooks the inherent diversity and heterogeneity across individuals, limiting the adaptability of RLHF to personalized scenarios and risking misalignments that can diminish user satisfaction and trust in AI systems. In this paper, we address these challenges by introducing Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) into the personalized RLHF framework. We apply LoRA in the the aggregated parameter space of all personalized reward functions, thereby enabling efficient learning of personalized reward models from potentially limited local datasets. Our approach exploits potential shared structures among the local ground-truth reward models while allowing for individual adaptation, without relying on restrictive assumptions about shared representations as in prior works. We further establish sample complexity guarantees for our method. Theoretical analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach in capturing both shared and individual-specific structures within heterogeneous human preferences, addressing the dual challenge of personalization requirements and practical data constraints. Experimental results on real-world datasets corroborate the efficiency of our algorithm in the personalized RLHF setting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at AISTATS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Mitigating Reward Over-Optimization in RLHF via Behavior-Supported Regularization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18130v1)** | 2025-03-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is an effective method for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values. However, reward over-optimization remains an open challenge leading to discrepancies between the performance of LLMs under the reward model and the true human objectives. A primary contributor to reward over-optimization is the extrapolation error that arises when the reward model evaluates out-of-distribution (OOD) responses. However, current methods still fail to prevent the increasing frequency of OOD response generation during the reinforcement learning (RL) process and are not effective at handling extrapolation errors from OOD responses. In this work, we propose the Behavior-Supported Policy Optimization (BSPO) method to mitigate the reward over-optimization issue. Specifically, we define behavior policy as the next token distribution of the reward training dataset to model the in-distribution (ID) region of the reward model. Building on this, we introduce the behavior-supported Bellman operator to regularize the value function, penalizing all OOD values without impacting the ID ones. Consequently, BSPO reduces the generation of OOD responses during the RL process, thereby avoiding overestimation caused by the reward model's extrapolation errors. Theoretically, we prove that BSPO guarantees a monotonic improvement of the supported policy until convergence to the optimal behavior-supported policy. Empirical results from extensive experiments show that BSPO outperforms baselines in preventing reward over-optimization due to OOD evaluation and finding the optimal ID policy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Understanding the Effects of RLHF on the Quality and Detectability of LLM-Generated Texts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17965v1)** | 2025-03-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance on a range of downstream NLP tasks by generating text that closely resembles human writing. However, the ease of achieving this similarity raises concerns from potential malicious uses at scale by bad actors, as LLM-generated text becomes increasingly difficult to discern from human text. Although detection methods have been developed to address this issue, bad actors can further manipulate LLM-generated texts to make them less detectable. In this work, we study how further editing texts with Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), which aligns model outputs with human preferences, affects (a) the quality of generated texts for two tasks, and (b) the performance of LLM-generated text detectors, looking at both training-based and zero-shot detection methods. Although RLHF improves the quality of LLM-generated texts, we find that it also tends to produce more detectable, lengthy, and repetitive outputs. Additionally, we observe that training-based detectors are vulnerable to short texts and to texts that incorporate code, whereas zero-shot detectors exhibit greater robustness.</p></details> | 14 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Aligning to What? Limits to RLHF Based Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09025v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is increasingly used to align large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. However, the effectiveness of RLHF in addressing underlying biases remains unclear. This study investigates the relationship between RLHF and both covert and overt biases in LLMs, particularly focusing on biases against African Americans. We applied various RLHF techniques (DPO, ORPO, and RLOO) to Llama 3 8B and evaluated the covert and overt biases of the resulting models using matched-guise probing and explicit bias testing. We performed additional tests with DPO on different base models and datasets; among several implications, we found that SFT before RLHF calcifies model biases. Additionally, we extend the tools for measuring biases to multi-modal models. Through our experiments we collect evidence that indicates that current alignment techniques are inadequate for nebulous tasks such as mitigating covert biases, highlighting the need for capable datasets, data curating techniques, or alignment tools.</p></details> |  |
| **[ROCM: RLHF on consistency models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06171v1)** | 2025-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have revolutionized generative modeling in continuous domains like image, audio, and video synthesis. However, their iterative sampling process leads to slow generation and inefficient training, challenges that are further exacerbated when incorporating Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) due to sparse rewards and long time horizons. Consistency models address these issues by enabling single-step or efficient multi-step generation, significantly reducing computational costs. In this work, we propose a direct reward optimization framework for applying RLHF to consistency models, incorporating distributional regularization to enhance training stability and prevent reward hacking. We investigate various $f$-divergences as regularization strategies, striking a balance between reward maximization and model consistency. Unlike policy gradient methods, our approach leverages first-order gradients, making it more efficient and less sensitive to hyperparameter tuning. Empirical results show that our method achieves competitive or superior performance compared to policy gradient based RLHF methods, across various automatic metrics and human evaluation. Additionally, our analysis demonstrates the impact of different regularization techniques in improving model generalization and preventing overfitting.</p></details> |  |
| **[On a Connection Between Imitation Learning and RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05079v1)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work studies the alignment of large language models with preference data from an imitation learning perspective. We establish a close theoretical connection between reinforcement learning from human feedback RLHF and imitation learning (IL), revealing that RLHF implicitly performs imitation learning on the preference data distribution. Building on this connection, we propose DIL, a principled framework that directly optimizes the imitation learning objective. DIL provides a unified imitation learning perspective on alignment, encompassing existing alignment algorithms as special cases while naturally introducing new variants. By bridging IL and RLHF, DIL offers new insights into alignment with RLHF. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DIL outperforms existing methods on various challenging benchmarks.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |
| **[LLM Misalignment via Adversarial RLHF Platforms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03039v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning has shown remarkable performance in aligning language models with human preferences, leading to the rise of attention towards developing RLHF platforms. These platforms enable users to fine-tune models without requiring any expertise in developing complex machine learning algorithms. While these platforms offer useful features such as reward modeling and RLHF fine-tuning, their security and reliability remain largely unexplored. Given the growing adoption of RLHF and open-source RLHF frameworks, we investigate the trustworthiness of these systems and their potential impact on behavior of LLMs. In this paper, we present an attack targeting publicly available RLHF tools. In our proposed attack, an adversarial RLHF platform corrupts the LLM alignment process by selectively manipulating data samples in the preference dataset. In this scenario, when a user's task aligns with the attacker's objective, the platform manipulates a subset of the preference dataset that contains samples related to the attacker's target. This manipulation results in a corrupted reward model, which ultimately leads to the misalignment of the language model. Our results demonstrate that such an attack can effectively steer LLMs toward undesirable behaviors within the targeted domains. Our work highlights the critical need to explore the vulnerabilities of RLHF platforms and their potential to cause misalignment in LLMs during the RLHF fine-tuning process.</p></details> |  |
| **[Taming Overconfidence in LLMs: Reward Calibration in RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09724v2)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language model calibration refers to the alignment between the confidence of the model and the actual performance of its responses. While previous studies point out the overconfidence phenomenon in Large Language Models (LLMs) and show that LLMs trained with Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) are overconfident with a more sharpened output probability, in this study, we reveal that RLHF tends to lead models to express verbalized overconfidence in their own responses. We investigate the underlying cause of this overconfidence and demonstrate that reward models used for Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) exhibit inherent biases towards high-confidence scores regardless of the actual quality of responses. Building upon this insight, we propose two PPO variants: PPO-M: PPO with Calibrated Reward Modeling and PPO-C: PPO with Calibrated Reward Calculation. PPO-M integrates explicit confidence scores in reward model training, which calibrates reward models to better capture the alignment between response quality and verbalized confidence. PPO-C adjusts the reward score during PPO based on the difference between the current reward and the exponential average of past rewards. Both PPO-M and PPO-C can be seamlessly integrated into the current PPO pipeline and do not require additional golden labels. We evaluate our methods on both Llama3-8B and Mistral-7B across six diverse datasets including multiple-choice and open-ended generation. Experimental results demonstrate that both of our methods can reduce calibration error and maintain performance comparable to standard PPO. We further show that they could preserve model capabilities in open-ended conversational settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating Defences against Unsafe Feedback in RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12914v3)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While there has been progress towards aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human values and ensuring safe behaviour at inference time, safety guards can easily be removed when fine tuned on unsafe and harmful datasets. While this setting has been treated extensively, another popular training paradigm, learning from unsafe feedback with reinforcement learning, has previously been unexplored. This is concerning due to the widespread deployment of feedback collection systems. We address this gap by providing an analysis of learning settings where feedback is harmful, i.e. that unsafe samples are preferred over safe ones despite model developers goal to maintain safety. We find that safety-aligned LLMs easily explore unsafe action spaces via generating harmful text and optimize for reward that violates safety constraints indicating that current safety guards are not enough to prevent learning from unsafe feedback. In order to protect against this vulnerability, we adapt a number of both "implict" and "explicit" harmful fine-tuning defences to evaluate whether they are effective as learning constraints in an RLHF setting finding that no method is generally effective pointing to the need for more defence research. We end the paper with the observation that some defences work by performing "harmless reward hacking" for which we provide a theoretical explanation drawn from the theory of Constrained Markov Decision Processes and provide some direction for future defence development.</p></details> |  |
| **[Projection Optimization: A General Framework for Multi-Objective and Multi-Group RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15145v2)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) is a widely used fine-tuning approach that aligns machine learning model, particularly Language Model (LM) with human preferences. There are typically multiple objectives driving the preference, hence humans find it easier to express per-objective comparisons rather than a global preference between two choices. Multi-Objective RLHF (MORLHF) aims to use per-objective preference feedback and achieve Pareto optimality among these objectives by aggregating them into a single unified objective for optimization. However, nearly all prior works rely on linear aggregation, which rules out policies that favor specific objectives such as the worst one. The only existing approach using non-linear aggregation is computationally expensive due to its reward-based nature and the need for retraining whenever the aggregation parameters change. In this work, we address this limitation by transforming the non-linear aggregation maximization problem into a series of sub-problems. Each sub-problem involves only linear aggregation, making it computationally efficient to solve. We further extend our framework to handle multi-group scenarios, where each group has distinct weights for the objectives. Our method enables achieving consensus or maximizing the aggregated objective across all groups. Theoretically, we demonstrate that our algorithmic framework achieves sublinear regret and can be easily adapted to a reward-free algorithm. Empirically, leveraging our theoretical insights, we propose a nearly training-free algorithm once the optimal policies for individual objectives are obtained.</p></details> |  |
| **[Simplify RLHF as Reward-Weighted SFT: A Variational Method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11026v2)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is crucial for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human values. However, RLHF has been continuously challenged by its high complexity in implementation and computation consumption. Even with recent simplifications, such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Advantage Leftover Lunch (A-LoL), the problems of over-fitting and training instability remain hindering the alignment process from the expected optimal performance. To address the existing challenges, we propose a novel simplification of RLHF from the perspective of variational inference, called $\textbf{V}$ariational $\textbf{A}$lignment with $\textbf{R}$e-weighting ($\textbf{VAR}$). More specifically, by directly minimizing the distribution gap between the learning LLM policy and the optimal solution of RLHF, we transform the alignment objective into a reward-driven re-weighted supervised fine-tuning (SFT) form, which only requires minor adjustment on the SFT loss to obtain noticeable improvement on training stability and effectiveness. On comprehensive alignment and generation benchmarks, our VAR method has numerically achieved competitive performance in LLM alignment helpfulness and harmlessness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Value-Incentivized Preference Optimization: A Unified Approach to Online and Offline RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19320v4)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has demonstrated great promise in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preference. Depending on the availability of preference data, both online and offline RLHF are active areas of investigation. A key bottleneck is understanding how to incorporate uncertainty estimation in the reward function learned from the preference data for RLHF, regardless of how the preference data is collected. While the principles of optimism or pessimism under uncertainty are well-established in standard reinforcement learning (RL), a practically-implementable and theoretically-grounded form amenable to large language models is not yet available, as standard techniques for constructing confidence intervals become intractable under arbitrary policy parameterizations. In this paper, we introduce a unified approach to online and offline RLHF -- value-incentivized preference optimization (VPO) -- which regularizes the maximum-likelihood estimate of the reward function with the corresponding value function, modulated by a $\textit{sign}$ to indicate whether the optimism or pessimism is chosen. VPO also directly optimizes the policy with implicit reward modeling, and therefore shares a simpler RLHF pipeline similar to direct preference optimization. Theoretical guarantees of VPO are provided for both online and offline settings, matching the rates of their standard RL counterparts. Moreover, experiments on text summarization and dialog verify the practicality and effectiveness of VPO.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

It has been shown to enhance both generation quality and trustworthiness. While numerous works have focused on improving retrieval, generation, and evaluation, the role of reward models in reinforcement learning for optimizing RAG remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{RAG-Reward}, a framework designed to develop reward models to enable \textit{hallucination-free, comprehensive, reliable, and efficient RAG}. We define four key metrics to assess generation quality and develop an automated benchmarking pipeline to evaluate the outputs of multiple LLMs across a variety of RAG scenarios. Using \textbf{RAG-Reward}, we train reward models and apply {reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF)} to improve LLMs' effectiveness in RAG. Experimental results demonstrate that our reward model achieves state-of-the-art performance in automatic benchmarking and aligns closely with human evaluations. Furthermore, the improved generation quality of the trained policy model highlights the feasibility and efficiency of using RLHF to enhance RAG outputs.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Equilibrate RLHF: Towards Balancing Helpfulness-Safety Trade-off in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11555v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) based on human preferences, commonly achieved through reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), has been effective in improving their performance. However, maintaining LLM safety throughout the fine-tuning process remains a significant challenge, as resolving conflicts between safety and helpfulness can be non-trivial. Typically, the safety alignment of LLM is trained on data with safety-related categories. However, our experiments find that naively increasing the scale of safety training data usually leads the LLMs to an ``overly safe'' state rather than a ``truly safe'' state, boosting the refusal rate through extensive safety-aligned data without genuinely understanding the requirements for safe responses. Such an approach can inadvertently diminish the models' helpfulness. To understand the phenomenon, we first investigate the role of safety data by categorizing them into three different groups, and observe that each group behaves differently as training data scales up. To boost the balance between safety and helpfulness, we propose an Equilibrate RLHF framework including a Fine-grained Data-centric (FDC) approach that achieves better safety alignment even with fewer training data, and an Adaptive Message-wise Alignment (AMA) approach, which selectively highlight the key segments through a gradient masking strategy. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances the safety alignment of LLMs while balancing safety and helpfulness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sharp Analysis for KL-Regularized Contextual Bandits and RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04625v2)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reverse-Kullback-Leibler (KL) regularization has emerged to be a predominant technique used to enhance policy optimization in reinforcement learning (RL) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), which forces the learned policy to stay close to a reference policy. While the effectiveness and necessity of KL-regularization have been empirically demonstrated in various practical scenarios, current theoretical analysis of KL-regularized RLHF still obtains the same $\mathcal{O}(1 / \epsilon^2)$ sample complexity as problems without KL-regularization. To understand the fundamental distinction between policy learning objectives with KL-regularization and ones without KL-regularization, we are the first to theoretically demonstrate the power of KL-regularization by providing a sharp analysis for KL-regularized contextual bandits and RLHF, revealing an $\mathcal{O}(1 / \epsilon)$ sample complexity when $\epsilon$ is sufficiently small. We further explore the role of data coverage in contextual bandits and RLHF. While the coverage assumption is commonly employed in offline RLHF to link the samples from the reference policy to the optimal policy, often at the cost of a multiplicative dependence on the coverage coefficient, its impact on the sample complexity of online RLHF remains unclear. Previous theoretical analyses of online RLHF typically require explicit exploration and additional structural assumptions on the reward function class. In contrast, we show that with sufficient coverage from the reference policy, a simple two-stage mixed sampling strategy can achieve a sample complexity with only an additive dependence on the coverage coefficient. Our results provide a comprehensive understanding of the roles of KL-regularization and data coverage in RLHF, shedding light on the design of more efficient RLHF algorithms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Influencing Humans to Conform to Preference Models for RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06416v2)** | 2025-02-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Designing a reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) algorithm to approximate a human's unobservable reward function requires assuming, implicitly or explicitly, a model of human preferences. A preference model that poorly describes how humans generate preferences risks learning a poor approximation of the human's reward function. In this paper, we conduct three human studies to asses whether one can influence the expression of real human preferences to more closely conform to a desired preference model. Importantly, our approach does not seek to alter the human's unobserved reward function. Rather, we change how humans use this reward function to generate preferences, such that they better match whatever preference model is assumed by a particular RLHF algorithm. We introduce three interventions: showing humans the quantities that underlie a preference model, which is normally unobservable information derived from the reward function; training people to follow a specific preference model; and modifying the preference elicitation question. All intervention types show significant effects, providing practical tools to improve preference data quality and the resultant alignment of the learned reward functions. Overall we establish a novel research direction in model alignment: designing interfaces and training interventions to increase human conformance with the modeling assumptions of the algorithm that will learn from their input.</p></details> |  |

We introduce Federated Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (FedRLHF), a novel framework that decentralizes the RLHF process. FedRLHF enables collaborative policy learning across multiple clients without necessitating the sharing of raw data or human feedback, thereby ensuring robust privacy preservation. Leveraging federated reinforcement learning, each client integrates human feedback locally into their reward functions and updates their policies through personalized RLHF processes. We establish rigorous theoretical foundations for FedRLHF, providing convergence guarantees, and deriving sample complexity bounds that scale efficiently with the number of clients. Empirical evaluations on the MovieLens and IMDb datasets demonstrate that FedRLHF not only preserves user privacy but also achieves performance on par with centralized RLHF, while enhancing personalization across diverse client environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Updated for AAMAS 2025 camera-ready.

| **[Segmenting Text and Learning Their Rewards for Improved RLHF in Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02790v1)** | 2025-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has been widely adopted to align language models (LMs) with human preference. Prior RLHF works typically take a bandit formulation, which, though intuitive, ignores the sequential nature of LM generation and can suffer from the sparse reward issue. While recent works propose dense token-level RLHF, treating each token as an action may be oversubtle to proper reward assignment. In this paper, we seek to get the best of both by training and utilizing a segment-level reward model, which assigns a reward to each semantically complete text segment that spans over a short sequence of tokens. For reward learning, our method allows dynamic text segmentation and compatibility with standard sequence-preference datasets. For effective RL-based LM training against segment reward, we generalize the classical scalar bandit reward normalizers into location-aware normalizer functions and interpolate the segment reward for further densification. With these designs, our method performs competitively on three popular RLHF benchmarks for LM policy: AlpacaEval 2.0, Arena-Hard, and MT-Bench. Ablation studies are conducted to further demonstrate our method.</p></details> |  |

Automatic Analysis of Refusal Composition in IFT/RLHF Datasets and Refusal Behavior of Black-Box LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16974v1)** | 2024-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Refusals - instances where large language models (LLMs) decline or fail to fully execute user instructions - are crucial for both AI safety and AI capabilities and the reduction of hallucinations in particular. These behaviors are learned during post-training, especially in instruction fine-tuning (IFT) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). However, existing taxonomies and evaluation datasets for refusals are inadequate, often focusing solely on should-not-related (instead of cannot-related) categories, and lacking tools for auditing refusal content in black-box LLM outputs. We present a comprehensive framework for classifying LLM refusals: (a) a taxonomy of 16 refusal categories, (b) a human-annotated dataset of over 8,600 instances from publicly available IFT and RLHF datasets, (c) a synthetic dataset with 8,000 examples for each refusal category, and (d) classifiers trained for refusal classification. Our work enables precise auditing of refusal behaviors in black-box LLMs and automatic analyses of refusal patterns in large IFT and RLHF datasets. This facilitates the strategic adjustment of LLM refusals, contributing to the development of more safe and reliable LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024 Workshop SFLLM</p></details> |
| **[More RLHF, More Trust? On The Impact of Preference Alignment On Trustworthiness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18870v2)** | 2024-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The trustworthiness of Large Language Models (LLMs) refers to the extent to which their outputs are reliable, safe, and ethically aligned, and it has become a crucial consideration alongside their cognitive performance. In practice, Reinforcement Learning From Human Feedback (RLHF) has been widely used to align LLMs with labeled human preferences, but its assumed effect on model trustworthiness hasn't been rigorously evaluated. To bridge this knowledge gap, this study investigates how models aligned with general-purpose preference data perform across five trustworthiness verticals: toxicity, stereotypical bias, machine ethics, truthfulness, and privacy. Our results demonstrate that RLHF on human preferences doesn't automatically guarantee trustworthiness, and reverse effects are often observed. Furthermore, we propose to adapt efficient influence function based data attribution methods to the RLHF setting to better understand the influence of fine-tuning data on individual trustworthiness benchmarks, and show its feasibility by providing our estimated attribution scores. Together, our results underscore the need for more nuanced approaches for model alignment from both the data and framework perspectives, and we hope this research will guide the community towards developing language models that are increasingly capable without sacrificing trustworthiness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Solving the Inverse Alignment Problem for Efficient RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10529v1)** | 2024-12-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Collecting high-quality preference datasets for reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is resource-intensive and challenging. As a result, researchers often train reward models on extensive offline datasets which aggregate diverse generation sources and scoring/alignment policies. We hypothesize that this aggregation has an averaging effect on reward model scores, which limits signal and impairs the alignment process. Inspired by the field of inverse RL, we define the 'inverse alignment problem' in language model training, where our objective is to optimize the critic's reward for a fixed actor and a fixed offline preference dataset. We hypothesize that solving the inverse alignment problem will improve reward model quality by providing clearer feedback on the policy's current behavior. To that end, we investigate whether repeatedly fine-tuning a reward model on subsets of the offline preference dataset aligned with a periodically frozen policy during RLHF improves upon vanilla RLHF. Our empirical results demonstrate that this approach facilitates superior alignment and faster convergence compared to using an unaligned or out-of-distribution reward model relative to the LLM policy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Does RLHF Scale? Exploring the Impacts From Data, Model, and Method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06000v1)** | 2024-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study explores the scaling properties of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) in Large Language Models (LLMs). Although RLHF is considered an important step in post-training of LLMs, its scaling potential is still largely unknown. We systematically analyze key components in the RLHF framework--model size, data composition, and inference budget--and their impacts on performance. Our findings show that increasing data diversity and volume improves reward model performance, helping process-supervision models scale better. For policy training, more response samples per prompt boost performance initially but quickly plateau. And larger reward models offer modest gains in policy training. In addition, larger policy models benefit less from RLHF with a fixed reward model. Overall, RLHF scales less efficiently than pretraining, with diminishing returns from additional computational resources. Based on these observations, we propose strategies to optimize RLHF performance within computational limits.</p></details> |  |
| **[Language Models Learn to Mislead Humans via RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12822v3)** | 2024-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language models (LMs) can produce errors that are hard to detect for humans, especially when the task is complex. RLHF, the most popular post-training method, may exacerbate this problem: to achieve higher rewards, LMs might get better at convincing humans that they are right even when they are wrong. We study this phenomenon under a standard RLHF pipeline, calling it "U-SOPHISTRY" since it is Unintended by model developers. Specifically, we ask time-constrained (e.g., 3-10 minutes) human subjects to evaluate the correctness of model outputs and calculate humans' accuracy against gold labels. On a question-answering task (QuALITY) and programming task (APPS), RLHF makes LMs better at convincing our subjects but not at completing the task correctly. RLHF also makes the model harder to evaluate: our subjects' false positive rate increases by 24.1% on QuALITY and 18.3% on APPS. Finally, we show that probing, a state-of-the-art approach for detecting Intended Sophistry (e.g. backdoored LMs), does not generalize to U-SOPHISTRY. Our results highlight an important failure mode of RLHF and call for more research in assisting humans to align them.</p></details> |  |
| **[Provably Mitigating Overoptimization in RLHF: Your SFT Loss is Implicitly an Adversarial Regularizer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16436v3)** | 2024-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aligning generative models with human preference via RLHF typically suffers from overoptimization, where an imperfectly learned reward model can misguide the generative model to output undesired responses. We investigate this problem in a principled manner by identifying the source of the misalignment as a form of distributional shift and uncertainty in learning human preferences. To mitigate overoptimization, we first propose a theoretical algorithm that chooses the best policy for an adversarially chosen reward model; one that simultaneously minimizes the maximum likelihood estimation of the loss and a reward penalty term. Here, the reward penalty term is introduced to prevent the policy from choosing actions with spurious high proxy rewards, resulting in provable sample efficiency of the algorithm under a partial coverage style condition. Moving from theory to practice, the proposed algorithm further enjoys an equivalent but surprisingly easy-to-implement reformulation. Using the equivalence between reward models and the corresponding optimal policy, the algorithm features a simple objective that combines: (i) a preference optimization loss that directly aligns the policy with human preference, and (ii) a supervised learning loss that explicitly imitates the policy with a (suitable) baseline distribution. In the context of aligning large language models (LLM), this objective fuses the direct preference optimization (DPO) loss with the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) loss to help mitigate the overoptimization towards undesired responses, for which we name the algorithm Regularized Preference Optimization (RPO). Experiments of aligning LLMs demonstrate the improved performance of RPO compared with DPO baselines. Our work sheds light on the interplay between preference optimization and SFT in tuning LLMs with both theoretical guarantees and empirical evidence.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by The Thirty-Eighth Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems. 31 pages, 7 figures</p></details> |
| **[Continual SFT Matches Multimodal RLHF with Negative Supervision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14797v1)** | 2024-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal RLHF usually happens after supervised finetuning (SFT) stage to continually improve vision-language models' (VLMs) comprehension. Conventional wisdom holds its superiority over continual SFT during this preference alignment stage. In this paper, we observe that the inherent value of multimodal RLHF lies in its negative supervision, the logit of the rejected responses. We thus propose a novel negative supervised finetuning (nSFT) approach that fully excavates these information resided. Our nSFT disentangles this negative supervision in RLHF paradigm, and continually aligns VLMs with a simple SFT loss. This is more memory efficient than multimodal RLHF where 2 (e.g., DPO) or 4 (e.g., PPO) large VLMs are strictly required. The effectiveness of nSFT is rigorously proved by comparing it with various multimodal RLHF approaches, across different dataset sources, base VLMs and evaluation metrics. Besides, fruitful of ablations are provided to support our hypothesis. We hope this paper will stimulate further research to properly align large vision language models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Value Imprint: A Technique for Auditing the Human Values Embedded in RLHF Datasets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11937v1)** | 2024-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs are increasingly fine-tuned using RLHF datasets to align them with human preferences and values. However, very limited research has investigated which specific human values are operationalized through these datasets. In this paper, we introduce Value Imprint, a framework for auditing and classifying the human values embedded within RLHF datasets. To investigate the viability of this framework, we conducted three case study experiments by auditing the Anthropic/hh-rlhf, OpenAI WebGPT Comparisons, and Alpaca GPT-4-LLM datasets to examine the human values embedded within them. Our analysis involved a two-phase process. During the first phase, we developed a taxonomy of human values through an integrated review of prior works from philosophy, axiology, and ethics. Then, we applied this taxonomy to annotate 6,501 RLHF preferences. During the second phase, we employed the labels generated from the annotation as ground truth data for training a transformer-based machine learning model to audit and classify the three RLHF datasets. Through this approach, we discovered that information-utility values, including Wisdom/Knowledge and Information Seeking, were the most dominant human values within all three RLHF datasets. In contrast, prosocial and democratic values, including Well-being, Justice, and Human/Animal Rights, were the least represented human values. These findings have significant implications for developing language models that align with societal values and norms. We contribute our datasets to support further research in this area.</p></details> |  |
| **[RLHF Workflow: From Reward Modeling to Online RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07863v3)** | 2024-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present the workflow of Online Iterative Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) in this technical report, which is widely reported to outperform its offline counterpart by a large margin in the recent large language model (LLM) literature. However, existing open-source RLHF projects are still largely confined to the offline learning setting. In this technical report, we aim to fill in this gap and provide a detailed recipe that is easy to reproduce for online iterative RLHF. In particular, since online human feedback is usually infeasible for open-source communities with limited resources, we start by constructing preference models using a diverse set of open-source datasets and use the constructed proxy preference model to approximate human feedback. Then, we discuss the theoretical insights and algorithmic principles behind online iterative RLHF, followed by a detailed practical implementation. Our trained LLM achieves impressive performance on LLM chatbot benchmarks, including AlpacaEval-2, Arena-Hard, and MT-Bench, as well as other academic benchmarks such as HumanEval and TruthfulQA. We have shown that supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and iterative RLHF can obtain state-of-the-art performance with fully open-source datasets. Further, we have made our models, curated datasets, and comprehensive step-by-step code guidebooks publicly available.

| **[A Theoretical Framework for Partially Observed Reward-States in RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03282v3)** | 2024-11-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing deployment of reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) calls for a deeper theoretical investigation of its underlying models. The prevalent models of RLHF do not account for neuroscience-backed, partially-observed "internal states" that can affect human feedback, nor do they accommodate intermediate feedback during an interaction. Both of these can be instrumental in speeding up learning and improving alignment. To address these limitations, we model RLHF as reinforcement learning with partially observed reward-states (PORRL). We accommodate two kinds of feedback $-$ cardinal and dueling feedback. We first demonstrate that PORRL subsumes a wide class of RL problems, including traditional RL, RLHF, and reward machines. For cardinal feedback, we present two model-based methods (POR-UCRL, POR-UCBVI). We give both cardinal regret and sample complexity guarantees for the methods, showing that they improve over naive history-summarization. We then discuss the benefits of a model-free method like GOLF with naive history-summarization in settings with recursive internal states and dense intermediate feedback. For this purpose, we define a new history aware version of the Bellman-eluder dimension and give a new guarantee for GOLF in our setting, which can be exponentially sharper in illustrative examples. For dueling feedback, we show that a naive reduction to cardinal feedback fails to achieve sublinear dueling regret. We then present the first explicit reduction that converts guarantees for cardinal regret to dueling regret. In both feedback settings, we show that our models and guarantees generalize and extend existing ones.</p></details> | <details><summary>64 pa...</summary><p>64 pages. 14 pages for main paper, 50 pages for references + appendix</p></details> |

It is common to mitigate this by regularizing the policy with KL divergence from a base model, with the hope that balancing reward with regularization will achieve desirable outcomes despite this reward misspecification. We show that when the reward function has light-tailed error, optimal policies under less restrictive KL penalties achieve arbitrarily high utility. However, if error is heavy-tailed, some policies obtain arbitrarily high reward despite achieving no more utility than the base model--a phenomenon we call catastrophic Goodhart. We adapt a discrete optimization method to measure the tails of reward models, finding that they are consistent with light-tailed error. However, the pervasiveness of heavy-tailed distributions in many real-world applications indicates that future sources of RL reward could have heavy-tailed error, increasing the likelihood of reward hacking even with KL regularization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Mecha...</summary><p>Mechanistic Interpretability workshop at ICML 2024; Main conference poster at NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |
| **[SALSA: Soup-based Alignment Learning for Stronger Adaptation in RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01798v1)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In Large Language Model (LLM) development, Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is crucial for aligning models with human values and preferences. RLHF traditionally relies on the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the current policy and a frozen initial policy as a reference, which is added as a penalty in policy optimization algorithms like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). While this constraint prevents models from deviating too far from the initial checkpoint, it limits exploration of the reward landscape, reducing the model's ability to discover higher-quality solutions. As a result, policy optimization is often trapped in a narrow region of the parameter space, leading to suboptimal alignment and performance. This paper presents SALSA (Soup-based Alignment Learning for Stronger Adaptation), a novel approach designed to overcome these limitations by creating a more flexible and better located reference model through weight-space averaging of two independent supervised fine-tuned (SFT) models. This model soup allows for larger deviation in KL divergence and exploring a promising region of the solution space without sacrificing stability. By leveraging this more robust reference model, SALSA fosters better exploration, achieving higher rewards and improving model robustness, out-of-distribution generalization, and performance. We validate the effectiveness of SALSA through extensive experiments on popular open models (Llama2-7B, Mistral-7B, and Gemma-2B) across various benchmarks (MT-Bench, Arena-Hard, UltraFeedback), where it consistently surpasses PPO by fostering deeper exploration and achieving superior alignment in LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[InfoRM: Mitigating Reward Hacking in RLHF via Information-Theoretic Reward Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09345v5)** | 2024-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the success of reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) in aligning language models with human values, reward hacking, also termed reward overoptimization, remains a critical challenge. This issue primarily arises from reward misgeneralization, where reward models (RMs) compute reward using spurious features that are irrelevant to human preferences. In this work, we tackle this problem from an information-theoretic perspective and propose a framework for reward modeling, namely InfoRM, by introducing a variational information bottleneck objective to filter out irrelevant information. Notably, we further identify a correlation between overoptimization and outliers in the IB latent space of InfoRM, establishing it as a promising tool for detecting reward overoptimization. Inspired by this finding, we propose the Cluster Separation Index (CSI), which quantifies deviations in the IB latent space, as an indicator of reward overoptimization to facilitate the development of online mitigation strategies. Extensive experiments on a wide range of settings and RM scales (70M, 440M, 1.4B, and 7B) demonstrate the effectiveness of InfoRM. Further analyses reveal that InfoRM's overoptimization detection mechanism is not only effective but also robust across a broad range of datasets, signifying a notable advancement in the field of RLHF. The code will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper has been accepted by NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |
| **[Towards Reliable Alignment: Uncertainty-aware RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23726v1)** | 2024-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in aligning Large Language Models with human preferences have benefited from larger reward models and better preference data. However, most of these methodologies rely on the accuracy of the reward model. The reward models used in Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) are typically learned from small datasets using stochastic optimization algorithms, making them prone to high variability. We illustrate the inconsistencies between reward models empirically on numerous open-source datasets. We theoretically show that the fluctuation of the reward models can be detrimental to the alignment problem because the derived policies are more overfitted to the reward model and, hence, are riskier if the reward model itself is uncertain. We use concentration of measure to motivate an uncertainty-aware, conservative algorithm for policy optimization. We show that such policies are more risk-averse in the sense that they are more cautious of uncertain rewards. We theoretically prove that our proposed methodology has less risk than the vanilla method. We corroborate our theoretical results with experiments based on designing an ensemble of reward models. We use this ensemble of reward models to align a language model using our methodology and observe that our empirical findings match our theoretical predictions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reward Difference Optimization For Sample Reweighting In Offline RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09385v2)** | 2024-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), aligning LLMs with human preferences become increasingly important. Although Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) proves effective, it is complicated and highly resource-intensive. As such, offline RLHF has been introduced as an alternative solution, which directly optimizes LLMs with ranking losses on a fixed preference dataset. Current offline RLHF only captures the "ordinal relationship" between responses, overlooking the crucial aspect of how much one is preferred over the others. To address this issue, we propose a simple yet effective solution called Reward Difference Optimization, shorted as RDO. Specifically, we introduce reward difference coefficients to reweigh sample pairs in offline RLHF. We then develop a difference model which captures rich interactions between a pair of responses for predicting these difference coefficients. Experiments with 7B LLMs on the HH and TL;DR datasets substantiate the effectiveness of our method in both automatic metrics and human evaluation, thereby highlighting its potential for aligning LLMs with human intent and values</p></details> | EMNLP 2024 findings |
| **[Measuring memorization in RLHF for code completion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11715v2)** | 2024-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) has become the dominant method to align large models to user preferences. Unlike fine-tuning, for which there are many studies regarding training data memorization, it is not clear how memorization is affected by or introduced in the RLHF alignment process. Understanding this relationship is important as real user data may be collected and used to align large models; if user data is memorized during RLHF and later regurgitated, this could raise privacy concerns. In addition to RLHF, other methods such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and $\Psi$PO have gained popularity for learning directly from human preferences, removing the need for optimizing intermediary reward models with reinforcement learning. In this work, we analyze how training data memorization can surface and propagate through each phase of RLHF and direct preference learning. We focus our study on code completion models, as code completion is one of the most popular use cases for large language models. We find that RLHF significantly decreases the chance that data used for reward modeling and reinforcement learning is memorized in comparison to directly fine-tuning on this data, but that examples already memorized during the fine-tuning stage of RLHF, will, in the majority of cases, remain memorized after RLHF. In contrast, we find that aligning by learning directly from human preference data via a special case of $\Psi$PO, Identity Preference Optimization (IPO), increases the likelihood that training data is regurgitated compared to RLHF. Our work suggests that RLHF, as opposed to direct preference learning, is a safer way to mitigate the risk of regurgitating sensitive preference data when aligning large language models. We find our conclusions are robust across multiple code completion datasets, tasks, and model scales.</p></details> |  |

Among reasoning tasks, multi-step reasoning poses a particular challenge. Grounded in the theory of formal logic, we have developed an automated method, Multi-step Deduction (MuseD), for deductive reasoning data. MuseD has allowed us to create training and testing datasets for multi-step reasoning. Our generation method enables control over the complexity of the generated instructions, facilitating training and evaluation of models across different difficulty levels. Through RLHF training, our training data has demonstrated significant improvements in logical capabilities for both in-domain of out-of-domain reasoning tasks. Additionally, we have conducted tests to assess the multi-step reasoning abilities of various models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimal Design for Reward Modeling in RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17055v2)** | 2024-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has become a popular approach to align language models (LMs) with human preferences. This method involves collecting a large dataset of human pairwise preferences across various text generations and using it to infer (implicitly or explicitly) a reward model. Numerous methods have been proposed to learn the reward model and align a LM with it. However, the costly process of collecting human preferences has received little attention and could benefit from theoretical insights. This paper addresses this issue and aims to formalize the reward training model in RLHF. We frame the selection of an effective dataset as a simple regret minimization task, using a linear contextual dueling bandit method. Given the potentially large number of arms, this approach is more coherent than the best-arm identification setting. We then propose an offline framework for solving this problem. Under appropriate assumptions - linearity of the reward model in the embedding space, and boundedness of the reward parameter - we derive bounds on the simple regret. Finally, we provide a lower bound that matches our upper bound up to constant and logarithmic terms. To our knowledge, this is the first theoretical contribution in this area to provide an offline approach as well as worst-case guarantees.</p></details> |  |
| **[How to Evaluate Reward Models for RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14872v2)** | 2024-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a new benchmark for reward models that quantifies their ability to produce strong language models through RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback). The gold-standard approach is to run a full RLHF training pipeline and directly probe downstream LLM performance. However, this process is prohibitively expensive. To address this, we build a predictive model of downstream LLM performance by evaluating the reward model on proxy tasks. These proxy tasks consist of a large-scale human preference and a verifiable correctness preference dataset, in which we measure 12 metrics across 12 domains. To investigate which reward model metrics are most correlated to gold-standard RLHF outcomes, we launch an end-to-end RLHF experiment on a large-scale crowdsourced human preference platform to view real reward model downstream performance as ground truth. Ultimately, we compile our data and findings into Preference Proxy Evaluations (PPE), the first reward model benchmark explicitly linked to post-RLHF real-world human preference performance, which we open-source for public use and further development. Our code and evaluations can be found at https://github.com/lmarena/PPE .</p></details> |  |

However, for applications that need operating with constraints on specific metrics (e.g., precision $\geq$ 95%), decision making with black-box LLMs remains unfavorable, due to their low numerical output cardinalities. This results in limited control over their operating points, preventing fine-grained adjustment of their decision making behavior. In this paper, we study using black-box LLMs as classifiers, focusing on efficiently improving their operational granularity without performance loss. Specifically, we first investigate the reasons behind their low-cardinality numerical outputs and show that they are biased towards generating rounded but informative verbalized probabilities. Then, we experiment with standard prompt engineering, uncertainty estimation and confidence elicitation techniques, and observe that they do not effectively improve operational granularity without sacrificing performance or increasing inference cost. Finally, we propose efficient approaches to significantly increase the number and diversity of available operating points. Our proposed approaches provide finer-grained operating points and achieve comparable to or better performance than the benchmark methods across 11 datasets and 3 LLMs.</p></details> | 35 pages |

This study explores students' perceptions of both tools, emphasizing usability, efficiency, and their integration into academic workflows. Employing a mixed-methods approach, we surveyed 109 students from diverse disciplines and conducted in-depth interviews with 12 participants. Quantitative analyses, including ANOVA and chi-square tests, were used to assess differences in efficiency, satisfaction, and tool preference. Qualitative insights revealed that students commonly switch between GPT and Google: using Google for credible, multi-source information and GPT for summarization, explanation, and drafting. While neither tool proved sufficient on its own, there was a strong demand for a hybrid solution. In response, we developed a prototype, a chatbot embedded within the search interface, that combines GPT's conversational capabilities with Google's reliability to enhance academic research and reduce cognitive load.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accte...</summary><p>Acctepted at the EMNLP 2025 HCI+NLP Workshop</p></details> |

However, current long-context LLM benchmarks are limited by rigid context length, labor-intensive annotation, and the pressing challenge of label leakage issues during LLM training. Therefore, we propose \textsc{AcademicEval}, a live benchmark for evaluating LLMs over long-context generation tasks. \textsc{AcademicEval} adopts papers on arXiv to introduce several academic writing tasks with long-context inputs, \textit{i.e.}, \textsc{Title}, \textsc{Abstract}, \textsc{Introduction}, and \textsc{Related Work}, which cover a wide range of abstraction levels and require no manual labeling. Moreover, \textsc{AcademicEval} integrates high-quality and expert-curated few-shot demonstrations from a collected co-author graph to enable flexible context length. Especially, \textsc{AcademicEval} features an efficient live evaluation, ensuring no label leakage. We conduct a holistic evaluation on \textsc{AcademicEval}, and the results illustrate that LLMs perform poorly on tasks with hierarchical abstraction levels and tend to struggle with long few-shot demonstrations, highlighting the challenge of our benchmark. Through experimental analysis, we also reveal some insights for enhancing LLMs' long-context modeling capabilities.

This capability can also serve as a fundamental mechanism for Self-Improvement, for example, by reconstructing datasets with refined results to enhance intrinsic model performance. However, our comprehensive experiments reveal that large language models (LLMs) show no clear evidence of inherent Self-Refinement and may even experience response quality degradation after Self-Refinement. To address this issue, we propose EVOLVE, a simple and effective framework for eliciting and tracking the evolution of Self-Refinement through iterative training. We first explore optimization methods during training to activate the model's Self-Refinement capability. Then, at inference, we investigate various generation strategies to further enhance and utilize Self-Refinement while supplying the necessary data for training. Through synergistic optimization of training and inference stages, we continually evolve the model's Self-Refinement ability, enabling it to better refine its own responses. Moreover, we demonstrate the potential of leveraging Self-Refinement to achieve broader Self-Improvement of intrinsic model abilities. Experiments show that the evolved Self-Refinement ability enables the Llama-3.1-8B base model to surpass GPT-4o, achieving 62.3% length-controlled and 63.3% raw win rates on AlpacaEval 2, and 50.3% on Arena-Hard. It also generalizes effectively to out-of-domain reasoning tasks, improving performance on mathematical reasoning benchmarks such as GSM8K and MATH.</p></details> |  |

| **[The Curious Case of Curiosity across Human Cultures and LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12943v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have expanded their role in human interaction, yet curiosity -- a central driver of inquiry -- remains underexplored in these systems, particularly across cultural contexts. In this work, we investigate cultural variation in curiosity using Yahoo! Answers, a real-world multi-country dataset spanning diverse topics. We introduce CUEST (CUriosity Evaluation across SocieTies), an evaluation framework that measures human-model alignment in curiosity through linguistic (style), topic preference (content) analysis and grounding insights in social science constructs. Across open- and closed-source models, we find that LLMs flatten cross-cultural diversity, aligning more closely with how curiosity is expressed in Western countries. We then explore fine-tuning strategies to induce curiosity in LLMs, narrowing the human-model alignment gap by up to 50%. Finally, we demonstrate the practical value of curiosity for LLM adaptability across cultures, showing its importance for future NLP research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint (Paper under review)</p></details> |

With the rapid advances of large language models (LLMs) trained on Internet-scale data, it raises the promise of employing LLMs to forecast real-world future events, an emerging paradigm we call "LLM-as-a-Prophet". This paper systematically investigates such predictive intelligence of LLMs. To this end, we build Prophet Arena, a general evaluation benchmark that continuously collects live forecasting tasks and decomposes each task into distinct pipeline stages, in order to support our controlled and large-scale experimentation. Our comprehensive evaluation reveals that many LLMs already exhibit impressive forecasting capabilities, reflected in, e.g., their small calibration errors, consistent prediction confidence and promising market returns. However, we also uncover key bottlenecks towards achieving superior predictive intelligence via LLM-as-a-Prophet, such as LLMs' inaccurate event recalls, misunderstanding of data sources and slower information aggregation compared to markets when resolution nears.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://www.prophetarena.co/</p></details> |
| **[PsyMem: Fine-grained psychological alignment and Explicit Memory Control for Advanced Role-Playing LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12814v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing LLM-based role-playing methods often rely on superficial textual descriptions or simplistic metrics, inadequately modeling both intrinsic and extrinsic character dimensions. Additionally, they typically simulate character memory with implicit model knowledge or basic retrieval augment generation without explicit memory alignment, compromising memory consistency. The two issues weaken reliability of role-playing LLMs in several applications, such as trustworthy social simulation. To address these limitations, we propose PsyMem, a novel framework integrating fine-grained psychological attributes and explicit memory control for role-playing. PsyMem supplements textual descriptions with 26 psychological indicators to detailed model character. Additionally, PsyMem implements memory alignment training, explicitly trains the model to align character's response with memory, thereby enabling dynamic memory-controlled responding during inference. By training Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct on our specially designed dataset (including 5,414 characters and 38,962 dialogues extracted from novels), the resulting model, termed as PsyMem-Qwen, outperforms baseline models in role-playing, achieving the best performance in human-likeness and character fidelity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Pre-M...</summary><p>Pre-MIT Press publication version, has been accepted by TACL</p></details> |

However, existing methods often yield unstructured meshes and exhibit poor interactivity, making them impractical for artistic workflows. To address these limitations, we represent 3D assets as shape programs and introduce ShapeCraft, a novel multi-agent framework for text-to-3D generation. At its core, we propose a Graph-based Procedural Shape (GPS) representation that decomposes complex natural language into a structured graph of sub-tasks, thereby facilitating accurate LLM comprehension and interpretation of spatial relationships and semantic shape details. Specifically, LLM agents hierarchically parse user input to initialize GPS, then iteratively refine procedural modeling and painting to produce structured, textured, and interactive 3D assets. Qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate ShapeCraft's superior performance in generating geometrically accurate and semantically rich 3D assets compared to existing LLM-based agents. We further show the versatility of ShapeCraft through examples of animated and user-customized editing, highlighting its potential for broader interactive applications.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 Poster |
| **[Does Math Reasoning Improve General LLM Capabilities? Understanding Transferability of LLM Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00432v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Math reasoning has become the poster child of progress in large language models (LLMs), with new models rapidly surpassing human-level performance on benchmarks like MATH and AIME. But as math leaderboards improve week by week, it is worth asking: do these gains reflect broader problem-solving ability or just narrow overfitting? To answer this question, we evaluate over 20 open-weight reasoning-tuned models across a broad suite of tasks, including math, scientific QA, agent planning, coding, and standard instruction-following. We surprisingly find that most models that succeed in math fail to transfer their gains to other domains. To rigorously study this phenomenon, we conduct controlled experiments on Qwen3-14B models using math-only data but different tuning methods. We find that reinforcement learning (RL)-tuned models generalize well across domains, while supervised fine-tuning (SFT)-tuned models often forget general capabilities. Latent-space representation and token-space distribution shift analyses reveal that SFT induces substantial representation and output drift, while RL preserves general-domain structure. Our results suggest a need to rethink standard post-training recipes, particularly the reliance on SFT-distilled data for advancing reasoning models.</p></details> |  |

We propose an intent-driven planning pipeline which can robustly construct such action sequences with varying degrees of supervisory input from a human using simple language instructions. The pipeline integrates: (i) perception-to-text scene encoding, (ii) an ensemble of large language models (LLMs) that generate candidate removal sequences based on the operator's intent, (iii) an LLM-based verifier that enforces formatting and precedence constraints, and (iv) a deterministic consistency filter that rejects hallucinated objects. The pipeline is evaluated on an example task in which two robot arms work collaboratively to dismantle an Electric Vehicle battery for recycling applications. A variety of components must be grasped and removed in specific sequences, determined by human instructions and/or by task-order feasibility decisions made by the autonomous system. On 200 real scenes with 600 operator prompts across five component classes, we used metrics of full-sequence correctness and next-task correctness to evaluate and compare five LLM-based planners (including ablation analyses of pipeline components). We also evaluated the LLM-based human interface in terms of time to execution and NASA TLX with human participant experiments. Results indicate that our ensemble-with-verification approach reliably maps operator intent to safe, executable multi-robot plans while maintaining low user effort.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work is funded by the project called "Research and Development of a Highly Automated and Safe Streamlined Process for Increasing Lithium-ion Battery Repurposing and Recycling" (REBELION) under Grant 101104241, and partially supported by the Ministry of National Education, Republic of Turkey.

We introduce DeTAILS, a toolkit that integrates large language model (LLM) assistance into a workflow inspired by Braun and Clarke's thematic analysis framework. DeTAILS supports researchers in generating and refining codes, reviewing clusters, and synthesizing themes through interactive feedback loops designed to preserve analytic agency. We evaluated the system with 18 qualitative researchers analyzing Reddit data. Quantitative results showed strong alignment between LLM-supported outputs and participants' refinements, alongside reduced workload and high perceived usefulness. Qualitatively, participants reported that DeTAILS accelerated analysis, prompted reflexive engagement with AI outputs, and fostered trust through transparency and control. We contribute: (1) an interactive human-LLM workflow for large-scale qualitative analysis, (2) empirical evidence of its feasibility and researcher experience, and (3) design implications for trustworthy AI-assisted qualitative research.</p></details> |  |

In particular, role-play prompts, where the model is assigned a functional role or identity, often give more robust and accurate relevance rankings. However, the mechanisms and diversity of role-play effects remain underexplored, limiting both effective use and interpretability. In this work, we systematically examine how role-play variations influence zero-shot LLM rankers. We employ causal intervention techniques from mechanistic interpretability to trace how role-play information shapes relevance judgments in LLMs. Our analysis reveals that (1) careful formulation of role descriptions have a large effect on the ranking quality of the LLM; (2) role-play signals are predominantly encoded in early layers and communicate with task instructions in middle layers, while receiving limited interaction with query or document representations. Specifically, we identify a group of attention heads that encode information critical for role-conditioned relevance. These findings not only shed light on the inner workings of role-play in LLM ranking but also offer guidance for designing more effective prompts in IR and beyond, pointing toward broader opportunities for leveraging role-play in zero-shot applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[FlexQuant: A Flexible and Efficient Dynamic Precision Switching Framework for LLM Quantization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12024v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has exacerbated the memory bottleneck due to the widening gap between model parameter scaling and hardware capabilities. While post-training quantization techniques effectively reduce memory overhead, existing methods predominantly rely on static quantization strategies, which struggle to adapt to dynamic workloads. To address this, we propose FlexQuant, a dynamic precision-switching framework that optimizes the trade-off between inference speed and accuracy. Leveraging model perplexity entropy and Kullback-Leibler divergence, FlexQuant enables fine-grained, layer-wise mixed-precision quantization and dynamically adjusts bit-widths during each token generation. FlexQuant provides a comprehensive analysis of quantization strategies, introduces a precision requirement model for optimal switching, and implements efficient fine-grained precision management. Evaluations demonstrate that FlexQuant achieves a 1.3x end-to-end speedup across diverse language tasks with negligible accuracy loss introduced. This framework offers a flexible and adaptive solution for efficient LLM deployment.

Traditional stress management tools often rely on static scripts or passive content, which are ineffective in alleviating stress. NieNie addresses this gap by combining rhythm biofeedback with real-time psychological guidance through a large language model (LLM), offering an interactive, tactile response. The system is specifically designed for young people experiencing emotional stress, collecting physiological signals such as heart rate variability and generating adaptive squeeze-release rhythms via soft, tactile devices. Utilising LLM, the system provides timely squeezing rhythms and psychologically guided feedback prompts, offering personalised rhythm games while reinforcing stress restructuring. Unlike traditional mental health apps, NieNie places users within an embodied interactive loop, leveraging tactile interaction, biofeedback, and adaptive language support to create an immersive stress regulation experience. This study demonstrates how embodied systems can connect bodily actions with mental health in everyday contexts.</p></details> |  |
| **[OncoReason: Structuring Clinical Reasoning in LLMs for Robust and Interpretable Survival Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17532v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting cancer treatment outcomes requires models that are both accurate and interpretable, particularly in the presence of heterogeneous clinical data. While large language models (LLMs) have shown strong performance in biomedical NLP, they often lack structured reasoning capabilities critical for high-stakes decision support. We present a unified, multi-task learning framework that aligns autoregressive LLMs with clinical reasoning for outcome prediction on the MSK-CHORD dataset. Our models are trained to jointly perform binary survival classification, continuous survival time regression, and natural language rationale generation. We evaluate three alignment strategies: (1) standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT), (2) SFT with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting to elicit step-by-step reasoning, and (3) Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a reinforcement learning method that aligns model outputs to expert-derived reasoning trajectories. Experiments with LLaMa3-8B and Med42-8B backbones demonstrate that CoT prompting improves F1 by +6.0 and reduces MAE by 12%, while GRPO achieves state-of-the-art interpretability and predictive performance across BLEU, ROUGE, and BERTScore. We further show that existing biomedical LLMs often fail to produce valid reasoning traces due to architectural constraints. Our findings underscore the importance of reasoning-aware alignment in multi-task clinical modeling and set a new benchmark for interpretable, trustworthy LLMs in precision oncology.</p></details> |  |
| **[Watch the Weights: Unsupervised monitoring and control of fine-tuned LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00161v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The releases of powerful open-weight large language models (LLMs) are often not accompanied by access to their full training data. Existing interpretability methods, particularly those based on activations, often require or assume distributionally similar data. This is a significant limitation when detecting and defending against novel potential threats like backdoors, which are by definition out-of-distribution. In this work, we introduce a new method for understanding, monitoring and controlling fine-tuned LLMs that interprets weights, rather than activations, thereby side stepping the need for data that is distributionally similar to the unknown training data. We demonstrate that the top singular vectors of the weight difference between a fine-tuned model and its base model correspond to newly acquired behaviors. By monitoring the cosine similarity of activations along these directions, we can detect salient behaviors introduced during fine-tuning with high precision. For backdoored models that bypasses safety mechanisms when a secret trigger is present, our method stops up to 100% of attacks with a false positive rate below 1.2%. For models that have undergone unlearning, we detect inference on erased topics with accuracy up to 95.42% and can even steer the model to recover "unlearned" information. Besides monitoring, our method also shows potential for pre-deployment model auditing: by analyzing commercial instruction-tuned models (OLMo, Llama, Qwen), we are able to uncover model-specific fine-tuning focus including marketing strategies and Midjourney prompt generation. Our implementation can be found at https://github.com/fjzzq2002/WeightWatch.</p></details> |  |

However, how to translate the research on general agents into productivity that drives industry transformations remains a significant challenge. To address this, this paper systematically reviews the technologies, applications, and evaluation methods of industry agents based on LLMs. Using an industry agent capability maturity framework, it outlines the evolution of agents in industry applications, from "process execution systems" to "adaptive social systems." First, we examine the three key technological pillars that support the advancement of agent capabilities: Memory, Planning, and Tool Use. We discuss how these technologies evolve from supporting simple tasks in their early forms to enabling complex autonomous systems and collective intelligence in more advanced forms. Then, we provide an overview of the application of industry agents in real-world domains such as digital engineering, scientific discovery, embodied intelligence, collaborative business execution, and complex system simulation. Additionally, this paper reviews the evaluation benchmarks and methods for both fundamental and specialized capabilities, identifying the challenges existing evaluation systems face regarding authenticity, safety, and industry specificity. Finally, we focus on the practical challenges faced by industry agents, exploring their capability boundaries, developmental potential, and governance issues in various scenarios, while providing insights into future directions. By combining technological evolution with industry practices, this review aims to clarify the current state and offer a clear roadmap and theoretical foundation for understanding and building the next generation of industry agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[Disparities in Multilingual LLM-Based Healthcare Q&A](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17476v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Equitable access to reliable health information is vital when integrating AI into healthcare. Yet, information quality varies across languages, raising concerns about the reliability and consistency of multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs). We systematically examine cross-lingual disparities in pre-training source and factuality alignment in LLM answers for multilingual healthcare Q&A across English, German, Turkish, Chinese (Mandarin), and Italian. We (i) constructed Multilingual Wiki Health Care (MultiWikiHealthCare), a multilingual dataset from Wikipedia; (ii) analyzed cross-lingual healthcare coverage; (iii) assessed LLM response alignment with these references; and (iv) conducted a case study on factual alignment through the use of contextual information and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Our findings reveal substantial cross-lingual disparities in both Wikipedia coverage and LLM factual alignment. Across LLMs, responses align more with English Wikipedia, even when the prompts are non-English. Providing contextual excerpts from non-English Wikipedia at inference time effectively shifts factual alignment toward culturally relevant knowledge. These results highlight practical pathways for building more equitable, multilingual AI systems for healthcare.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[Certified Self-Consistency: Statistical Guarantees and Test-Time Training for Reliable Reasoning in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17472v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances such as self-consistency and test-time reinforcement learning (TTRL) improve the reliability of large language models (LLMs) without additional supervision, yet their underlying mechanisms and statistical guarantees remain poorly understood. We present a unified framework for certifiable inference in LLMs, showing that majority voting provides a statistical certificate of self-consistency: under mild assumptions, the aggregated answer coincides with the mode of the model's terminal distribution with high probability. We derive finite-sample and anytime-valid concentration bounds that quantify this confidence, and introduce the Martingale Majority Certificate (MMC), a sequential stopping rule that adaptively determines when sufficient samples have been drawn. We further prove that label-free post-training methods such as TTRL implicitly sharpen the answer distribution by exponentially tilting it toward its mode, thereby reducing the number of samples required for certification. Building on this insight, we propose new post-training objectives that explicitly optimise this trade-off between sharpness and bias. Together, these results explain and connect two central test-time scaling strategies, self-consistency and TTRL, within a single statistical framework for label-free, certifiable reliability in reasoning LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[OCR-APT: Reconstructing APT Stories from Audit Logs using Subgraph Anomaly Detection and LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15188v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) are stealthy cyberattacks that often evade detection in system-level audit logs. Provenance graphs model these logs as connected entities and events, revealing relationships that are missed by linear log representations. Existing systems apply anomaly detection to these graphs but often suffer from high false positive rates and coarse-grained alerts. Their reliance on node attributes like file paths or IPs leads to spurious correlations, reducing detection robustness and reliability. To fully understand an attack's progression and impact, security analysts need systems that can generate accurate, human-like narratives of the entire attack. To address these challenges, we introduce OCR-APT, a system for APT detection and reconstruction of human-like attack stories. OCR-APT uses Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for subgraph anomaly detection, learning behavior patterns around nodes rather than fragile attributes such as file paths or IPs. This approach leads to a more robust anomaly detection. It then iterates over detected subgraphs using Large Language Models (LLMs) to reconstruct multi-stage attack stories. Each stage is validated before proceeding, reducing hallucinations and ensuring an interpretable final report. Our evaluations on the DARPA TC3, OpTC, and NODLINK datasets show that OCR-APT outperforms state-of-the-art systems in both detection accuracy and alert interpretability. Moreover, OCR-APT reconstructs human-like reports that comprehensively capture the attack story.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the authors' extended version of the paper accepted for publication at the ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS 2025).

| **[LLM as GNN: Graph Vocabulary Learning for Text-Attributed Graph Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03313v3)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-Attributed Graphs (TAGs), where each node is associated with text descriptions, are ubiquitous in real-world scenarios. They typically exhibit distinctive structure and domain-specific knowledge, motivating the development of a Graph Foundation Model (GFM) that generalizes across diverse graphs and tasks. Despite large efforts to integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for TAGs, existing approaches suffer from decoupled architectures with two-stage alignment, limiting their synergistic potential. Even worse, existing methods assign out-of-vocabulary (OOV) tokens to graph nodes, leading to graph-specific semantics, token explosion, and incompatibility with task-oriented prompt templates, which hinders cross-graph and cross-task transferability. To address these challenges, we propose PromptGFM, a versatile GFM for TAGs grounded in graph vocabulary learning. PromptGFM comprises two key components: (1) Graph Understanding Module, which explicitly prompts LLMs to replicate the finest GNN workflow within the text space, facilitating seamless GNN-LLM integration and elegant graph-text alignment; (2) Graph Inference Module, which establishes a language-based graph vocabulary ensuring expressiveness, transferability, and scalability, enabling readable instructions for LLM fine-tuning. Extensive experiments demonstrate our superiority and transferability across diverse graphs and tasks. The code is available at this: https://github.com/agiresearch/PromptGFM.</p></details> |  |
| **[CAPO: Towards Enhancing LLM Reasoning through Generative Credit Assignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02298v4)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has improved the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by using rule-based binary feedback. However, current RLVR methods typically assign the same reward to every token. This coarse-grained feedback hampers precise credit assignment, making it hard for models to identify which reasoning steps lead to success or failure, and often results in suboptimal policies. Methods like PPO provide credit assignment by value estimation, but yield inaccurate and unverifiable signals due to limited sampling. On the other hand, methods using Process Reward Models can provide step-wise rewards but suffer from several key limitations: they require high-quality process supervision labels, the feedback is unreliable due to probabilistic reward modeling, and their application in online reinforcement learning (RL) is time-consuming. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a simple but efficient method-Credit Assignment Policy Optimization (CAPO). Instead of training auxiliary models, CAPO directly leverages an off-the-shelf, general-purpose LLM as a Generative Process Reward Model (LLM-as-GenPRM) to generate all step-wise critique by one pass only based on the correctness of the step itself, providing deterministic token-level credits to refine the tokens that were originally assigned identical rule-based rewards. To further enhance the accuracy and robustness, we employ voting mechanisms that scale with the number of generated critiques. Extensive experiments on various backbones like Llama and Qwen models show that CAPO consistently outperforms supervised learning-based and RL-based fine-tuning methods across four challenging mathematical benchmarks and three out-of-domain benchmarks. Further analysis shows that CAPO can help the model to foster the learning of correct reasoning pathways leading to correct answers.</p></details> | Work in progress |

Despite strong performance on academic benchmarks, they often fail to tailor responses to students' grade levels. This is a critical need in K-12 education, where age-appropriate vocabulary and explanation are essential for effective learning. Existing models frequently produce outputs that are too advanced or vague for younger learners, and there are no standardized benchmarks to evaluate their ability to adjust across cognitive and developmental stages. To address this gap, we introduce EduAdapt, a benchmark of nearly 48k grade-labeled QA pairs across nine science subjects, spanning Grades 1-12 and grouped into four grade levels. We evaluate a diverse set of open-source LLMs on EduAdapt and find that while larger models generally perform better, they still struggle with generating suitable responses for early-grade students (Grades 1-5). Our work presents the first dataset and evaluation framework for assessing grade-level adaptability in LLMs, aiming to foster more developmentally aligned educational AI systems through better training and prompting strategies.

We evaluate 20 IT-LLMs on modified MMLU and MMLU-Pro benchmarks, by systematically varying the format of option labels (alphabetic, numeric, Roman) while keeping their meaning identical under four paradigms, namely: (1) With explicit instructions, label changes cause large performance shifts (e.g., -30.45\% for Roman vs. numeric), revealing instruction-format bias. (2) Without instructions, performance drops further (up to -10.84\%) and label sensitivity intensifies, underscoring the role of explicit guidance. (3) When option contents are removed, models fail random-choice baselines except with numeric labels, suggesting weak adherence to atomic directives. (4) Three-shot exemplars yield no significant gains in robustness or fidelity, and generation analyses show persistent label errors, especially for non-numeric formats. Across model sizes, larger LLMs achieve higher accuracy but remain inconsistent in instruction adherence. These results expose the insufficiencies of current instruction-tuning paradigms and highlight the need for evaluation methods and training strategies that explicitly target atomic instruction-following.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 1 figure, 8 tables</p></details> |

Reasoning large language models (LLMs) promise cross-task adaptability with trans- parent reasoning traces, yet their potential has not been fully realized for tabular data. This paper presents TabR1, the first reasoning LLM for tabular prediction with multi-step reasoning. At its core is Permutation Relative Policy Optimization (PRPO), a simple yet efficient reinforcement learning method that encodes column-permutation invariance as a structural prior. By construct- ing multiple label-preserving permutations per sample and estimating advantages both within and across permutations, PRPO transforms sparse rewards into dense learning signals and improves generalization. With limited supervision, PRPO activates the reasoning ability of LLMs for tabular prediction, enhancing few-shot and zero-shot performance as well as interpretability. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that TabR1 achieves performance comparable to strong baselines under full-supervision fine-tuning. In the zero-shot setting, TabR1 approaches the performance of strong baselines under the 32-shot setting. Moreover, TabR1 (8B) substantially outperforms much larger LLMs across various tasks, achieving up to 53.17% improvement over DeepSeek-R1 (685B).</p></details> |  |

However, these models face challenges in streaming scenarios where hour-long videos must be processed online, and questions need timely responses. In this work, we propose a training-free approach compatible with standard Video-LLMs, leveraging three key concepts: 1) LLM-informed selection of visual tokens to identify those that the LLM has attended to and contributed to its understanding of each short clip. Our attention-based selection allows us to discard up to ~95% of unimportant visual tokens with minimal performance loss; 2) Recurrent processing of past selected tokens to generate temporally coherent understanding of each processed clip; 3) Caption-based question answering for lightweight and accurate responses.

The key innovations are (1) a locality dial, a tunable parameter that dynamically controls the degree of localization during both training and inference without requiring model retraining, (2) an information-theoretic recruitment mechanism that adaptively allocates semantic blocks as needed, eliminating the requirement for complete domain knowledge at initialization, and (3) a hierarchical recruitment framework that extends capacity allocation to entire specialized LLMs, enabling multi-granularity architectural adaptation. This is achieved through group sparsity penalties on attention mechanisms, information-theoretic anchor design, dynamic rule injection, and principled recruitment criteria based on penalized likelihood with explicit units. We provide rigorous mathematical results establishing explicit threshold conditions under which attention provably concentrates on semantically relevant blocks at stationary points, with exact bounds on attention entropy and pointer fidelity. The hierarchical recruitment mechanism provides convergence guarantees at both the block level (fine-grained, within-LLM) and the LLM level (coarse-grained, cross-domain), ensuring the system discovers semantic partitions that balance model complexity against data encoding efficiency. This framework enables practitioners to continuously interpolate between interpretable and high-performance modes while adapting architectural capacity at multiple granularities, supporting applications in regulated domains requiring both transparency and capability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust LLM Training Infrastructure at ByteDance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16293v4)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The training scale of large language models (LLMs) has reached tens of thousands of GPUs and is still continuously expanding, enabling faster learning of larger models. Accompanying the expansion of the resource scale is the prevalence of failures (CUDA error, NaN values, job hang, etc.), which poses significant challenges to training stability. Any large-scale LLM training infrastructure should strive for minimal training interruption, efficient fault diagnosis, and effective failure tolerance to enable highly efficient continuous training. This paper presents ByteRobust, a large-scale GPU infrastructure management system tailored for robust and stable training of LLMs. It exploits the uniqueness of LLM training process and gives top priorities to detecting and recovering failures in a routine manner. Leveraging parallelisms and characteristics of LLM training, ByteRobust enables high-capacity fault tolerance, prompt fault demarcation, and localization with an effective data-driven approach, comprehensively ensuring continuous and efficient training of LLM tasks. ByteRobust is deployed on a production GPU platform and achieves 97% ETTR for a three-month training job on 9,600 GPUs.</p></details> |  |

Fine-tuning LLMs on supervised datasets to address this is impractical due to high computational costs and limited parameter access. To tackle this, we propose DICE, a lightweight framework that guides small language models (SLMs) to refine LLMs' outputs through chain-of-thought (CoT) correction. DICE decouples the process by first prompting LLMs to generate natural language responses, then using trained SLMs to analyze and refine these outputs to meet structured output specifications. This framework preserves LLMs' broad knowledge and reasoning capabilities while ensuring the outputs conform to user demands. Specifically, DICE first constructs structured CoT adaptation datasets via a two-stage method and subsequently applies a dual-tuning strategy to fine-tune SLMs for generating structured outputs in an analyze-then-answer pattern. Experiments demonstrate that DICE improves the average format accuracy and content correctness of LLM outputs by 35.4\% and 29.4\%, respectively, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance over other competitive baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was accepted to the EMNLP 2025 main conference</p></details> |
| **[MemoryBench: A Benchmark for Memory and Continual Learning in LLM Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17281v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scaling up data, parameters, and test-time computation has been the mainstream methods to improve LLM systems (LLMsys), but their upper bounds are almost reached due to the gradual depletion of high-quality data and marginal gains obtained from larger computational resource consumption. Inspired by the abilities of human and traditional AI systems in learning from practice, constructing memory and continual learning frameworks for LLMsys has become an important and popular research direction in recent literature. Yet, existing benchmarks for LLM memory often focus on evaluating the system on homogeneous reading comprehension tasks with long-form inputs rather than testing their abilities to learn from accumulated user feedback in service time. Therefore, we propose a user feedback simulation framework and a comprehensive benchmark covering multiple domains, languages, and types of tasks to evaluate the continual learning abilities of LLMsys. Experiments show that the effectiveness and efficiency of state-of-the-art baselines are far from satisfying, and we hope this benchmark could pave the way for future studies on LLM memory and optimization algorithms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Wisdom is Knowing What not to Say: Hallucination-Free LLMs Unlearning via Attention Shifting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17210v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increase in computing power and the necessity of AI-assisted decision-making boost the growing application of large language models (LLMs). Along with this, the potential retention of sensitive data of LLMs has spurred increasing research into machine unlearning. However, existing unlearning approaches face a critical dilemma: Aggressive unlearning compromises model utility, while conservative strategies preserve utility but risk hallucinated responses. This significantly limits LLMs' reliability in knowledge-intensive applications. To address this, we introduce a novel Attention-Shifting (AS) framework for selective unlearning. AS is driven by two design objectives: (1) context-preserving suppression that attenuates attention to fact-bearing tokens without disrupting LLMs' linguistic structure; and (2) hallucination-resistant response shaping that discourages fabricated completions when queried about unlearning content. AS realizes these objectives through two attention-level interventions, which are importance-aware suppression applied to the unlearning set to reduce reliance on memorized knowledge and attention-guided retention enhancement that reinforces attention toward semantically essential tokens in the retained dataset to mitigate unintended degradation. These two components are jointly optimized via a dual-loss objective, which forms a soft boundary that localizes unlearning while preserving unrelated knowledge under representation superposition. Experimental results show that AS improves performance preservation over the state-of-the-art unlearning methods, achieving up to 15% higher accuracy on the ToFU benchmark and 10% on the TDEC benchmark, while maintaining competitive hallucination-free unlearning effectiveness. Compared to existing methods, AS demonstrates a superior balance between unlearning effectiveness, generalization, and response reliability.</p></details> | 22 pages, 10 figures |

Meanwhile, the rapid expansion of information services has led to a growing demand for AI-enabled wireless networks. The open-source DeepSeek models are famous for their innovative designs, such as large-scale pure RL and cost-efficient training, which make them well-suited for practical deployment in wireless networks. By integrating DeepSeek-style LLMs with wireless infrastructures, a synergistic opportunity arises: the DeepSeek-style LLMs enhance network optimization with strong reasoning and decision-making abilities, while wireless infrastructure enables the broad deployment of these models. Motivated by this convergence, this survey presents a comprehensive DeepSeek-inspired exploration of RL-based LLMs in the context of wireless networks. We begin by reviewing key techniques behind network optimization to establish a foundation for understanding DeepSeek-style LLM integration. Next, we examine recent advancements in RL-based LLMs, using DeepSeek models as a representative example. Building on this, we explore the synergy between the two domains, highlighting motivations, challenges, and potential solutions. Finally, we highlight emerging directions for integrating LLMs with wireless networks, such as quantum, on-device, and neural-symbolic LLM models, as well as embodied AI agents. Overall, this survey offers a comprehensive examination of the interplay between DeepSeek-style LLMs and wireless networks, demonstrating how these domains can mutually enhance each other to drive innovation.</p></details> | 45 pages, 12 figures |

In a pilot with seven users (280 rated turns), offline policy evaluation (OPE) over factorized decision heads (Tool/Style) shows that a uniform heavy-tool policy raises average value on logs but harms specific subgroups, most notably low-health-literacy/high-self-efficacy users. A lightweight simulator with hidden archetypes further shows that adding a small early information-gain bonus reliably shortens trait identification and improves goal success and pass@3. Together, these early findings indicate an evaluation-first path to personalization: freeze the generator, learn subgroup-aware decision heads on typed rewards (objective tool outcomes and satisfaction), and always report per-archetype metrics to surface subgroup harms that averages obscure.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the NeurIPS 2025 Workshop on Multi-Turn Interactions in Large Language Models</p></details> |
| **[TREAT: A Code LLMs Trustworthiness / Reliability Evaluation and Testing Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17163v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large foundation models are fundamentally transforming the software engineering landscape, demonstrating exceptional capabilities across diverse tasks such as code generation, debugging, and testing. Despite this rapid progress, a significant gap remains in how to comprehensively evaluate these models' trustworthiness in real-world software engineering scenarios. Existing benchmarks suffer from limited task scope and fail to incorporate critical evaluation aspects such as the robustness and reliability of models. To bridge this gap, we present an evaluation framework called TREAT (Code LLMs Trustworthiness / Reliability Evaluation And Testing) that provides a holistic assessment of model performance in code intelligence tasks. Our evaluation framework addresses key limitations in existing approaches with four main improvements: (1) Multi-Task Holistic Evaluation that spans diverse software engineering activities rather than limited coding tasks; (2) Multi-Language and Multi-Modality Assessment that extends beyond traditional single-language, text-only benchmarks to include multi-modality coding tasks; (3) Robustness Assessment that evaluates model reliability under semantically-preserving code transformations; and (4) Rigorous Evaluation Methodology that enhances the trustworthiness of evaluation results through diverse evaluation prompts and adaptive solution extraction. Based on this evaluation framework, we assess 26 state-of-the-art models and uncover both their strengths and limitations, yielding several key insights:(1) Current models show substantial performance variation across programming tasks; (2) Multi-modal language models demonstrate specific performance limitations in UI code generation and edit;</p></details> |  |
| **[When LLM Agents Meet Graph Optimization: An Automated Data Quality Improvement Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08952v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-attributed graphs (TAGs) have become a key form of graph-structured data in modern data management and analytics, combining structural relationships with rich textual semantics for diverse applications. However, the effectiveness of analytical models, particularly graph neural networks (GNNs), is highly sensitive to data quality. Our empirical analysis shows that both conventional and LLM-enhanced GNNs degrade notably under textual, structural, and label imperfections, underscoring TAG quality as a key bottleneck for reliable analytics. Existing studies have explored data-level optimization for TAGs, but most focus on specific degradation types and target a single aspect like structure or label, lacking a systematic and comprehensive perspective on data quality improvement. To address this gap, we propose LAGA (Large Language and Graph Agent), a unified multi-agent framework for comprehensive TAG quality optimization. LAGA formulates graph quality control as a data-centric process, integrating detection, planning, action, and evaluation agents into an automated loop. It holistically enhances textual, structural, and label aspects through coordinated multi-modal optimization. Extensive experiments on 5 datasets and 16 baselines across 9 scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness, robustness and scalability of LAGA, confirming the importance of data-centric quality optimization for reliable TAG analytics.</p></details> | 12 pages, 7figures |
| **[Do LLMs Recognize Your Latent Preferences? A Benchmark for Latent Information Discovery in Personalized Interaction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17132v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at producing broadly relevant text, but this generality becomes a limitation when user-specific preferences are required, such as recommending restaurants or planning travel. In these scenarios, users rarely articulate every preference explicitly; instead, much of what they care about remains latent, waiting to be inferred. This raises a fundamental question: Can LLMs uncover and reason about such latent information through conversation? We address this problem by introducing a unified benchmark for evaluating latent information discovery - the ability of LLMs to reveal and utilize hidden user attributes through multi-turn interaction. The benchmark spans three progressively realistic settings: the classic 20 Questions game, Personalized Question Answering, and Personalized Text Summarization. All tasks share a tri-agent framework (User, Assistant, Judge) enabling turn-level evaluation of elicitation and adaptation. Our results reveal that while LLMs can indeed surface latent information through dialogue, their success varies dramatically with context: from 32% to 98%, depending on task complexity, topic, and number of hidden attributes. This benchmark provides the first systematic framework for studying latent information discovery in personalized interaction, highlighting that effective preference inference remains an open frontier for building truly adaptive AI systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[BLUR: A Bi-Level Optimization Approach for LLM Unlearning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08164v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enabling large language models (LLMs) to unlearn knowledge and capabilities acquired during training has proven vital for ensuring compliance with data regulations and promoting ethical practices in generative AI. Although there are growing interests in developing various unlearning algorithms, it remains unclear how to best formulate the unlearning problem. The most popular formulation uses a weighted sum of forget and retain loss, but it often leads to performance degradation due to the inherent trade-off between forget and retain losses. In this work, we argue that it is important to model the hierarchical structure of the unlearning problem, where the forget problem (which \textit{unlearns} certain knowledge and/or capabilities) takes priority over the retain problem (which preserves model utility). This hierarchical structure naturally leads to a bi-level optimization formulation where the lower-level objective focuses on minimizing the forget loss, while the upper-level objective aims to maintain the model's utility. Based on this new formulation, we propose a novel algorithm, termed Bi-Level UnleaRning (\texttt{BLUR}), which not only possesses strong theoretical guarantees but more importantly, delivers superior performance. In particular, our extensive experiments demonstrate that \texttt{BLUR} consistently outperforms all the state-of-the-art algorithms across various unlearning tasks, models, and metrics.

| **[Leveraging Robust Optimization for LLM Alignment under Distribution Shifts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05831v4)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Preference alignment methods are increasingly critical for steering large language models (LLMs) to generate outputs consistent with human values. While recent approaches often rely on synthetic data generated by LLMs for scalability and cost-efficiency reasons, this reliance can introduce distribution shifts that undermine the nuanced representation of human preferences needed for desirable outputs. In this paper, we propose a novel distribution-aware optimization framework that improves preference alignment despite such shifts. Our approach first leverages well-learned classifiers to assign a calibration value to each training sample, quantifying its alignment with the target human-preferred distribution. These values are then incorporated into a robust optimization objective that minimizes the worst-case loss over regions of the data space most relevant to human preferences. By explicitly focusing optimization on the target distribution, our approach mitigates the impact of distributional mismatch and improves the generation of responses that better reflect intended values.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |

Our key idea is to impose syntactic and semantic biases on programs generated by LLMs, such that the synthesized program is more amenable to automated verification. Based on this idea, we propose a novel specification-verification tool, built on top of Verified Software Toolchain, that help automate the process. Our experiments on a diverse set of benchmarks drawn from the deductive program synthesis community, shows that this approach is scalable and extensible. The benchmarks constitute of specifications comprising of basic coding examples, Separation Logic based assertions, and API specifications.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Ends Justify the Thoughts: RL-Induced Motivated Reasoning in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17057v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The use of reinforcement learning (RL) with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning has emerged as a promising approach for developing more capable language models. In turn, this has led to investigation of CoT monitoring as a compelling method for detecting harmful behaviors such as reward hacking, under the assumption that models' reasoning processes reflect their internal decision-making. In practice, LLM training often produces unintended behaviors due to imperfect reward signals, leading models to develop misaligned tendencies. A common corrective approach is to apply post-hoc instructions to avoid problematic behaviors like sycophancy, but what happens to the model's reasoning process when these instructions conflict with learned behaviors? We investigate this question in simple settings and find that models engage in systematic motivated reasoning -- generating plausible-sounding justifications for violating their instructions while downplaying potential harms. Beyond being an interesting property of training, we find that while motivated reasoning can be detected by most frontier reasoning models, smaller LLM judges can fail to identify a portion of it, and in rare cases can themselves be persuaded that the reasoning is correct, despite it contradicting clear instructions. This capability gap raises concerns that as models become more sophisticated, their motivated reasoning may become increasingly difficult for monitors to detect. Our results underscore the need to account for motivated reasoning when relying on chain-of-thought processes for model evaluation and oversight. All code for this paper will be made available. WARNING: some examples in this paper may be upsetting.</p></details> | 26 pages |

Our approach harnesses the capabilities of multimodal LLMs to jointly process text and video, in order to effectively localize natural language queries in videos through a two-stage process. Rather than being directly grounded, language queries are initially transformed into enriched sentences that incorporate missing details and cues to aid in grounding. In the second stage, these enriched queries are grounded, using a lightweight decoder, which specializes at predicting accurate boundaries conditioned on contextualized representations of the enriched queries. To mitigate noise and reduce the impact of hallucinations, our model is trained with a multiple-instance-learning objective that dynamically selects the optimal version of the query for each training sample. We demonstrate state-of-the-art results across various benchmarks in temporal video grounding and paragraph grounding settings. Experiments reveal that our method significantly outperforms all previously proposed LLM-based temporal grounding approaches and is either superior or comparable to specialized models, while maintaining a clear advantage against them in zero-shot evaluation scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025 (Highlights)</p></details> |

Yet, with the rise of open-weight LLMs, we ask: can the unlearning process itself be backdoored, appearing successful under normal conditions yet reverting to pre-unlearned behavior when a hidden trigger is activated? Drawing inspiration from classical backdoor attacks that embed triggers into training data to enforce specific behaviors, we investigate backdoor unlearning, where models forget as intended in the clean setting but recover forgotten knowledge when the trigger appears. We show that designing such attacks presents unique challenges, hinging on where triggers are placed and how backdoor training is reinforced. We uncover a strong link between backdoor efficacy and the attention sink phenomenon, i.e., shallow input tokens consistently attract disproportionate attention in LLMs. Our analysis reveals that these attention sinks serve as gateways for backdoor unlearning: placing triggers at sink positions and aligning their attention values markedly enhances backdoor persistence. Extensive experiments validate these findings, showing that attention-sink-guided backdoor unlearning reliably restores forgotten knowledge in the presence of backdoor triggers, while behaving indistinguishably from a normally unlearned model when triggers are absent. Code is available at https://github.com/OPTML-Group/Unlearn-Backdoor.</p></details> |  |

While researchers have primarily focused on improving their utility, their safety behaviors remain underexplored. In this paper, we first evaluate search agents using red-teaming datasets and find that they are more likely to produce harmful outputs than base LLMs. For example, when asked ``How can I track someone's location without their consent?'', a base model refuses, whereas a search agent designed to retrieve and cite sources may lower its refusal threshold, fetch documents (e.g., court cases), and, once appended, synthesize them into an informative yet unsafe summary. We further show that utility-oriented fine-tuning intensifies this risk, motivating joint alignment of safety and utility. We present SafeSearch, a multi-objective reinforcement learning approach that couples a final-output safety/utility reward with a novel query-level shaping term that penalizes unsafe queries and rewards safe ones. Experiments show that SafeSearch reduces agent harmfulness by over 70% across three red-teaming datasets while producing safe, helpful responses, and matches the QA performance of a utility-only finetuned agent; further analyses confirm the effectiveness of the query-level reward in jointly improving safety and utility.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/ZQS1943/SafeSearch</p></details> |

When serving those applications in shared GPU servers, the schedulers are expected to attain fast application completions with guaranteed worst-case performance. However, mainstream LLM schedulers fail to behave well for LLM applications -- due to head-of-line blocking or over-constrained resource allocation. In this paper, we propose to serve LLM applications in a fair and also efficient manner. To this end, we design Justitia, a novel scheduler with three key techniques. First, given that memory is prevalently a bottleneck for mainstream inference frameworks like vLLM, Justitia models the service cost of LLM applications in a memory-centric manner. Meanwhile, it uses a simple neural network model to conduct light-weight and also accurate demand prediction. Moreover, Justitia adopts a virtual-time based fair queuing algorithm to reduce the overall performance with guaranteed worst-case delay. We have implemented Justitia atop vLLM, and experimental results involving diverse LLM applications show that it can substantially enhance the scheduling efficiency with fairness preserved.</p></details> |  |

We are still lacking more challenging, and im- portantly also multilingual, benchmarks focus- ing on implicit information and pragmatic infer- ences across larger documents in the context of discourse tracking: integrating and aggregating information across sentences, paragraphs and multiple speaker utterances. To this end, we present DiscoTrack, an LLM benchmark target- ing a range of tasks across 12 languages and four levels of discourse understanding: salience recognition, entity tracking, discourse relations and bridging inference. Our evaluation shows that these tasks remain challenging, even for state-of-the-art models.</p></details> |  |
| **[RL-PLUS: Countering Capability Boundary Collapse of LLMs in Reinforcement Learning with Hybrid-policy Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00222v4)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) has significantly advanced the complex reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, it struggles to break through the inherent capability boundaries of the base LLM, due to its essentially on-policy strategy coupled with LLM's immense action space and sparse reward. Critically, RLVR can lead to the capability boundary collapse, narrowing the LLM's problem-solving scope. To address this problem, we propose RL-PLUS, a novel hybrid-policy optimization approach for LLMs that synergizes internal exploitation with external data to achieve stronger reasoning capabilities and surpass the boundaries of base models. RL-PLUS integrates two core components, i.e., Multiple Importance Sampling to address distributional mismatch from external data, and Exploration-Based Advantage Function to guide the model towards high-value, unexplored reasoning paths. We provide both theoretical analysis and extensive experiments to demonstrate the superiority and generalizability of our approach. Compared with existing RLVR methods, RL-PLUS achieves 1) state-of-the-art performance on six math reasoning benchmarks; 2) superior performance on six out-of-distribution reasoning tasks; 3) consistent and significant gains across diverse model families, with average relative improvements up to 69.2\%. Moreover, the analysis of Pass@k curves indicates that RL-PLUS effectively resolves the capability boundary collapse problem.</p></details> |  |

Recently, zeroth-order (ZO) optimization stood out as a promising memory-efficient training paradigm, avoiding backward passes and relying solely on forward passes for gradient estimation, making it attractive for resource-constrained scenarios. However, ZO method lags far behind FO method in both convergence speed and accuracy. To bridge the gap, we introduce a novel layer-wise divergence analysis that uncovers the distinct update pattern of FO and ZO optimization. Aiming to resemble the learning capacity of FO method from the findings, we propose Divergence-driven Zeroth-Order (DiZO) optimization. DiZO conducts divergence-driven layer adaptation by incorporating projections to ZO updates, generating diverse-magnitude updates precisely scaled to layer-wise individual optimization needs. Our results demonstrate that DiZO significantly reduces the needed iterations for convergence without sacrificing throughput, cutting training GPU hours by up to 48\% on various datasets. Moreover, DiZO consistently outperforms the representative ZO baselines in fine-tuning RoBERTa-large, OPT-series, and Llama-series on downstream tasks and, in some cases, even surpasses memory-intensive FO fine-tuning. Our code is released at https://github.com/Skilteee/DiZO.</p></details> |  |

While recent large language model (LLM)-based approaches have shown promise in circuit topology generation and device sizing, most rely solely on textual representations such as SPICE netlists, which lack visual interpretability for circuit designers. To address this limitation, we propose EEschematic, an AI agent for automatic analog schematic generation based on a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). EEschematic integrates textual, visual, and symbolic modalities to translate SPICE netlists into schematic diagrams represented in a human-editable format. The framework uses six analog substructure examples for few-shot placement and a Visual Chain-of-Thought (VCoT) strategy to iteratively refine placement and wiring, enhancing schematic clarity and symmetry. Experimental results on representative analog circuits, including a CMOS inverter, a five-transistor operational transconductance amplifier (5T-OTA), and a telescopic cascode amplifier, demonstrate that EEschematic produces schematics with high visual quality and structural correctness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Vocab Diet: Reshaping the Vocabulary of LLMs with Vector Arithmetic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17001v1)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) were shown to encode word form variations, such as "walk"->"walked", as linear directions in embedding space. However, standard tokenization algorithms treat these variations as distinct tokens -- filling the size-capped vocabulary with surface form variants (e.g., "walk", "walking", "Walk"), at the expense of less frequent words and multilingual coverage. We show that many of these variations can be captured by transformation vectors -- additive offsets that yield the appropriate word's representation when applied to the base form word embedding -- in both the input and output spaces. Building on this, we propose a compact reshaping of the vocabulary: rather than assigning unique tokens to each surface form, we compose them from shared base form and transformation vectors (e.g., "walked" = "walk" + past tense). We apply our approach to multiple LLMs and across five languages, removing up to 10% of vocabulary entries -- thereby freeing space to allocate new, more diverse tokens. Importantly, we do so while also expanding vocabulary coverage to out-of-vocabulary words, with minimal impact on downstream performance, and without modifying model weights. Our findings motivate a foundational rethinking of vocabulary design, moving from string enumeration to a compositional vocabulary that leverages the underlying structure of language.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bits Leaked per Query: Information-Theoretic Bounds on Adversarial Attacks against LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17000v1)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adversarial attacks by malicious users that threaten the safety of large language models (LLMs) can be viewed as attempts to infer a target property $T$ that is unknown when an instruction is issued, and becomes knowable only after the model's reply is observed. Examples of target properties $T$ include the binary flag that triggers an LLM's harmful response or rejection, and the degree to which information deleted by unlearning can be restored, both elicited via adversarial instructions. The LLM reveals an \emph{observable signal} $Z$ that potentially leaks hints for attacking through a response containing answer tokens, thinking process tokens, or logits. Yet the scale of information leaked remains anecdotal, leaving auditors without principled guidance and defenders blind to the transparency--risk trade-off. We fill this gap with an information-theoretic framework that computes how much information can be safely disclosed, and enables auditors to gauge how close their methods come to the fundamental limit. Treating the mutual information $I(Z;T)$ between the observation $Z$ and the target property $T$ as the leaked bits per query, we show that achieving error $\varepsilon$ requires at least $\log(1/\varepsilon)/I(Z;T)$ queries, scaling linearly with the inverse leak rate and only logarithmically with the desired accuracy. Thus, even a modest increase in disclosure collapses the attack cost from quadratic to logarithmic in terms of the desired accuracy. Experiments on seven LLMs across system-prompt leakage, jailbreak, and relearning attacks corroborate the theory: exposing answer tokens alone requires about a thousand queries; adding logits cuts this to about a hundred; and revealing the full thinking process trims it to a few dozen. Our results provide the first principled yardstick for balancing transparency and security when deploying LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 (spotlight)</p></details> |
| **[DOGe: Defensive Output Generation for LLM Protection Against Knowledge Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19504v2)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) represent substantial intellectual and economic investments, yet their effectiveness can inadvertently facilitate model imitation via knowledge distillation (KD). In practical scenarios, competitors can distill proprietary LLM capabilities by simply observing publicly accessible outputs, akin to reverse-engineering a complex performance by observation alone. Existing protective methods like watermarking only identify imitation post-hoc, while other defenses assume the student model mimics the teacher's internal logits, rendering them ineffective against distillation purely from observed output text. This paper confronts the challenge of actively protecting LLMs within the realistic constraints of API-based access. We introduce an effective and efficient Defensive Output Generation (DOGe) strategy that subtly modifies the output behavior of an LLM. Its outputs are accurate and useful for legitimate users, yet are designed to be misleading for distillation, significantly undermining imitation attempts. We achieve this by fine-tuning only the final linear layer of the teacher LLM with an adversarial loss. This targeted training approach anticipates and disrupts distillation attempts during inference time. Our experiments show that, while preserving the performance of the teacher model, student models distilled from the defensively generated outputs demonstrate catastrophically reduced performance, demonstrating DOGe as a practical safeguard against KD-based model imitation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is available at https://github.com/unites-lab/doge</p></details> |
| **[Lark: Biologically Inspired Neuroevolution for Multi-Stakeholder LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16978v1)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Lark, a biologically inspired decision-making framework that couples LLM-driven reasoning with an evolutionary, stakeholder-aware Multi-Agent System (MAS). To address verbosity and stakeholder trade-offs, we integrate four mechanisms: (i) plasticity, which applies concise adjustments to candidate solutions; (ii) duplication and maturation, which copy high-performing candidates and specialize them into new modules; (iii) ranked-choice stakeholder aggregation using influence-weighted Borda scoring; and (iv) compute awareness via token-based penalties that reward brevity. The system iteratively proposes diverse strategies, applies plasticity tweaks, simulates stakeholder evaluations, aggregates preferences, selects top candidates, and performs duplication/maturation while factoring compute cost into final scores. In a controlled evaluation over 30 rounds comparing 14 systems, Lark Full achieves a mean rank of 2.55 (95% CI [2.17, 2.93]) and a mean composite score of 29.4/50 (95% CI [26.34, 32.46]), finishing Top-3 in 80% of rounds while remaining cost competitive with leading commercial models ($0.016 per task). Paired Wilcoxon tests confirm that all four mechanisms contribute significantly as ablating duplication/maturation yields the largest deficit ({\Delta}Score = 3.5, Cohen's d_z = 2.53, p < 0.001), followed by plasticity ({\Delta}Score = 3.4, d_z = 1.86), ranked-choice voting ({\Delta}Score = 2.4, d_z = 1.20), and token penalties ({\Delta}Score = 2.2, d_z = 1.63). Rather than a formal Markov Decision Process with constrained optimization, Lark is a practical, compute-aware neuroevolutionary loop that scales stakeholder-aligned strategy generation and makes trade-offs transparent through per-step metrics. Our work presents proof-of-concept findings and invites community feedback as we expand toward real-world validation studies.</p></details> | <details><summary>39th ...</summary><p>39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025) Workshop: NeurIPS 2025 Workshop on Efficient Reasoning</p></details> |

In this work, we introduce $Q\sharp$, a value-based algorithm for KL-regularized RL that guides the reference policy using the optimal regularized $Q$ function. We propose to learn the optimal $Q$ function using distributional RL on an aggregated online dataset. Unlike prior value-based baselines that guide the model using unregularized $Q$-values, our method is theoretically principled and provably learns the optimal policy for the KL-regularized RL problem. Empirically, $Q\sharp$ outperforms prior baselines in math reasoning benchmarks while maintaining a smaller KL divergence to the reference policy. Theoretically, we establish a reduction from KL-regularized RL to no-regret online learning, providing the first bounds for deterministic MDPs under only realizability. Thanks to distributional RL, our bounds are also variance-dependent and converge faster when the reference policy has small variance. In sum, our results highlight $Q\sharp$ as an effective approach for post-training LLMs, offering both improved performance and theoretical guarantees. The code can be found at https://github.com/jinpz/q_sharp.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |
| **[Peering Inside the Black Box: Uncovering LLM Errors in Optimization Modelling through Component-Level Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16943v1)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to convert natural language descriptions into mathematical optimization formulations. Current evaluations often treat formulations as a whole, relying on coarse metrics like solution accuracy or runtime, which obscure structural or numerical errors. In this study, we present a comprehensive, component-level evaluation framework for LLM-generated formulations. Beyond the conventional optimality gap, our framework introduces metrics such as precision and recall for decision variables and constraints, constraint and objective root mean squared error (RMSE), and efficiency indicators based on token usage and latency. We evaluate GPT-5, LLaMA 3.1 Instruct, and DeepSeek Math across optimization problems of varying complexity under six prompting strategies. Results show that GPT-5 consistently outperforms other models, with chain-of-thought, self-consistency, and modular prompting proving most effective. Analysis indicates that solver performance depends primarily on high constraint recall and low constraint RMSE, which together ensure structural correctness and solution reliability. Constraint precision and decision variable metrics play secondary roles, while concise outputs enhance computational efficiency. These findings highlight three principles for NLP-to-optimization modeling: (i) Complete constraint coverage prevents violations, (ii) minimizing constraint RMSE ensures solver-level accuracy, and (iii) concise outputs improve computational efficiency. The proposed framework establishes a foundation for fine-grained, diagnostic evaluation of LLMs in optimization modeling.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we focus on the capabilities of the most recent reasoning models to generate optimized CUDA code for predefined, well-known tasks. Our objective is to determine which types of code optimizations and parallel patterns the LLMs can perform by themselves and whether they can be improved by tutoring (providing more detailed hints and guidelines in the prompt). The generated solutions were evaluated both automatically (for correctness and speedup) and manually (code reviews) to provide a more detailed perspective. We also tried an interactive approach where the LLM can fix its previous mistakes within a session. The results indicate that LLMs are quite skilled coders; however, they require tutoring to reach optimized solutions provided by parallel computing experts.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This preprint has not undergone peer review or any post-submission improvements or corrections.

| **[Prompt-MII: Meta-Learning Instruction Induction for LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16932v1)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A popular method to adapt large language models (LLMs) to new tasks is in-context learning (ICL), which is effective but incurs high inference costs as context length grows. In this paper we propose a method to perform instruction induction, where we take training examples and reduce them to a compact but descriptive prompt that can achieve performance comparable to ICL over the full training set. Specifically, we propose PROMPT-MII, a reinforcement learning (RL) based framework to meta-learn an instruction induction model that can generate compact instructions on the fly for an arbitrary new dataset. We train on over 3,000 diverse classification datasets from the HuggingFace hub, and evaluate on 90 unseen tasks. PROMPT-MII improves downstream model quality by 4-9 F1 points (10-20% relative), matching ICL performance while requiring 3-13x fewer tokens.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods either rely on prompt engineering, which leads to poor generalization across problem types, or require costly supervised training. We introduce SolverLLM, a training-free framework that leverages test-time scaling to solve diverse optimization problems. Rather than solving directly, SolverLLM generates mathematical formulations and translates them into solver-ready code, guided by a novel Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) strategy. To enhance the search process, we modify classical MCTS with (1) dynamic expansion for adaptive formulation generation, (2) prompt backpropagation to guide exploration via outcome-driven feedback, and (3) uncertainty backpropagation to incorporate reward reliability into decision-making. Experiments on six standard benchmark datasets demonstrate that SolverLLM outperforms both prompt-based and learning-based baselines, achieving strong generalization without additional training.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |

| **[Utility-Diversity Aware Online Batch Selection for LLM Supervised Fine-tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16882v1)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is a commonly used technique to adapt large language models (LLMs) to downstream tasks. In practice, SFT on a full dataset is computationally expensive and sometimes suffers from overfitting or bias amplification. This facilitates the rise of data curation in SFT, which prioritizes the most valuable data to optimze. This work studies the online batch selection family that dynamically scores and filters samples during the training process. However, existing popular methods often (i) rely merely on the utility of data to select a subset while neglecting other crucial factors like diversity, (ii) rely on external resources such as reference models or validation sets, and (iii) incur extra training time over full-dataset training. To address these limitations, this work develops \textbf{UDS (Utility-Diversity Sampling)}, a framework for efficient online batch selection in SFT. UDS leverages the nuclear norm of the logits matrix to capture both data utility and intra-sample diversity, while estimating inter-sample diversity through efficient low-dimensional embedding comparisons with a lightweight memory buffer of historical samples. Such a design eliminates the need for external resources and unnecessary backpropagation, securing computational efficiency. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that UDS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art online batch selection methods under varying data budgets, and significantly reduces training time compared to full-dataset fine-tuning.

| **[PrediQL: Automated Testing of GraphQL APIs with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10407v2)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>GraphQL's flexible query model and nested data dependencies expose APIs to complex, context-dependent vulnerabilities that are difficult to uncover using conventional testing tools. Existing fuzzers either rely on random payload generation or rigid mutation heuristics, failing to adapt to the dynamic structures of GraphQL schemas and responses. We present PrediQL, the first retrieval-augmented, LLM-guided fuzzer for GraphQL APIs. PrediQL combines large language model reasoning with adaptive feedback loops to generate semantically valid and diverse queries. It models the choice of fuzzing strategy as a multi-armed bandit problem, balancing exploration of new query structures with exploitation of past successes. To enhance efficiency, PrediQL retrieves and reuses execution traces, schema fragments, and prior errors, enabling self-correction and progressive learning across test iterations. Beyond input generation, PrediQL integrates a context-aware vulnerability detector that uses LLM reasoning to analyze responses, interpreting data values, error messages, and status codes to identify issues such as injection flaws, access-control bypasses, and information disclosure. Our evaluation across open-source and benchmark GraphQL APIs shows that PrediQL achieves significantly higher coverage and vulnerability discovery rates compared to state-of-the-art baselines. These results demonstrate that combining retrieval-augmented reasoning with adaptive fuzzing can transform API security testing from reactive enumeration to intelligent exploration.</p></details> | 8 pages, two columns |

We introduce a two-stage retrieve-and-rerank framework that finetunes LLMs for cross-genre AA. Unlike the field of information retrieval (IR), where retrieve-and-rerank is a de facto strategy, cross-genre AA systems must avoid relying on topical cues and instead learn to identify author-specific linguistic patterns that are independent of the text's subject matter (genre/domain/topic). Consequently, for the reranker, we demonstrate that training strategies commonly used in IR are fundamentally misaligned with cross-genre AA, leading to suboptimal behavior. To address this, we introduce a targeted data curation strategy that enables the reranker to effectively learn author-discriminative signals. Using our LLM-based retrieve-and-rerank pipeline, we achieve substantial gains of 22.3 and 34.4 absolute Success@8 points over the previous state-of-the-art on HIATUS's challenging HRS1 and HRS2 cross-genre AA benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[When Many-Shot Prompting Fails: An Empirical Study of LLM Code Translation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16809v1)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) with vast context windows offer new avenues for in-context learning (ICL), where providing many examples ("many-shot" prompting) is often assumed to enhance performance. We investigate this assumption for the complex task of code translation. Through a large-scale empirical study of over 90,000 translations, we systematically evaluate the impact of scaling in-context examples from zero-shot to many-shot configurations of up to 625 examples, with prompts spanning from approximately 100,000 to 800,000 tokens. Our findings reveal a "many-shot paradox": while static similarity metrics may modestly improve with more examples, functional correctness consistently peaks with few-shot prompting (5-25 examples). Providing substantially more examples often degrades this crucial functional performance. This study highlights that for code translation, the quality of a few well-chosen examples outweighs sheer quantity, challenging the universal efficacy of "more is better" for ICL and underscoring the task-dependent nature of optimal prompting strategies. Our results have significant implications for effectively leveraging LLMs in software engineering.</p></details> |  |

This study proposes and validates a systematic frame- work that translates return forecasts and predictive uncertainty from Large Language Models (LLMs) into the core inputs for the Black-Litterman model: investor views and their confidence lev- els. Through a backtest on S&P 500 constituents, we demonstrate that portfolios driven by top-performing LLMs significantly out- perform traditional baselines in both absolute and risk-adjusted terms. Crucially, our analysis reveals that each LLM exhibits a dis- tinct and consistent investment style which is the primary driver of performance. We found that the selection of an LLM is therefore not a search for a single best forecaster, but a strategic choice of an investment style whose success is contingent on its alignment with the prevailing market regime.

Existing black-box attacks require either access to continuous model outputs like logits or confidence scores (which are rarely available in practice), or rely on proxy signals from other models. Instead, we demonstrate how to prompt LLMs to express their internal confidence in a way that is sufficiently calibrated to enable effective adversarial optimization. We apply our general method to three attack scenarios: adversarial examples for vision-LLMs, jailbreaks and prompt injections. Our attacks successfully generate malicious inputs against systems that only expose textual outputs, thereby dramatically expanding the attack surface for deployed LLMs. We further find that better and larger models exhibit superior calibration when expressing confidence, creating a concerning security paradox where model capability improvements directly enhance vulnerability. Our code is available at this [link](https://github.com/zj-jayzhang/black_box_llm_optimization).</p></details> |  |

Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse domains, leading to the emergence of "LLM-as-a-Judge," where LLMs are employed as evaluators for complex tasks. With their ability to process diverse data types and provide scalable, cost-effective, and consistent assessments, LLMs present a compelling alternative to traditional expert-driven evaluations. However, ensuring the reliability of LLM-as-a-Judge systems remains a significant challenge that requires careful design and standardization. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of LLM-as-a-Judge, addressing the core question: How can reliable LLM-as-a-Judge systems be built? We explore strategies to enhance reliability, including improving consistency, mitigating biases, and adapting to diverse assessment scenarios. Additionally, we propose methodologies for evaluating the reliability of LLM-as-a-Judge systems, supported by a novel benchmark designed for this purpose. To advance the development and real-world deployment of LLM-as-a-Judge systems, we also discussed practical applications, challenges, and future directions. This survey serves as a foundational reference for researchers and practitioners in this rapidly evolving field.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://awesome-llm-as-a-judge.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[When To Solve, When To Verify: Compute-Optimal Problem Solving and Generative Verification for LLM Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01005v2)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scaling test-time compute has emerged as a key strategy for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), particularly in tasks like mathematical problem-solving. A traditional approach, Self-Consistency (SC), generates multiple solutions to a problem and selects the most common answer via majority voting. Another common method involves scoring each solution with a reward model (verifier) and choosing the best one. Recent advancements in Generative Reward Models (GenRM) reframe verification as a next-token prediction task, enabling inference-time scaling along a new axis. Specifically, GenRM generates multiple verification chains-of-thought to score each solution. Under a limited inference budget, this introduces a fundamental trade-off: should you spend the budget on scaling solutions via SC or generate fewer solutions and allocate compute to verification via GenRM? To address this, we evaluate GenRM against SC under a fixed inference budget. Interestingly, we find that SC is more compute-efficient than GenRM for most practical inference budgets across diverse models and datasets. For instance, GenRM first matches SC after consuming up to 8x the inference compute and requires significantly more compute to outperform it. Furthermore, we derive inference scaling laws for the GenRM paradigm, revealing that compute-optimal inference favors scaling solution generation more aggressively than scaling the number of verifications. Our work provides practical guidance on optimizing test-time scaling by balancing solution generation and verification. The code is available at https://github.com/nishadsinghi/sc-genrm-scaling.</p></details> | COLM 2025 |

However, systematic analysis of these agent systems remain limited, particularly regarding performance variations among top-performing ones. In this paper, we examine six repair systems on the SWE-bench Verified benchmark for automated bug fixing. We first assess each system's overall performance, noting the instances solvable by all or none of these systems, and explore the capabilities of different systems. We also compare fault localization accuracy at file and code symbol levels and evaluate bug reproduction capabilities. Through analysis, we concluded that further optimization is needed in both the LLM capability itself and the design of Agentic flow to improve the effectiveness of the Agent in bug fixing.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Systematic Approach to Predict the Impact of Cybersecurity Vulnerabilities Using LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18439v2)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vulnerability databases, such as the National Vulnerability Database (NVD), offer detailed descriptions of Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs), but often lack information on their real-world impact, such as the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) that adversaries may use to exploit the vulnerability. However, manually linking CVEs to their corresponding TTPs is a challenging and time-consuming task, and the high volume of new vulnerabilities published annually makes automated support desirable. This paper introduces TRIAGE, a two-pronged automated approach that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to map CVEs to relevant techniques from the ATT&CK knowledge base. We first prompt an LLM with instructions based on MITRE's CVE Mapping Methodology to predict an initial list of techniques. This list is then combined with the results from a second LLM-based module that uses in-context learning to map a CVE to relevant techniques. This hybrid approach strategically combines rule-based reasoning with data-driven inference. Our evaluation reveals that in-context learning outperforms the individual mapping methods, and the hybrid approach improves recall of exploitation techniques. We also find that GPT-4o-mini performs better than Llama3.3-70B on this task. Overall, our results show that LLMs can be used to automatically predict the impact of cybersecurity vulnerabilities and TRIAGE makes the process of mapping CVEs to ATT&CK more efficient.

| **[T3 Planner: A Self-Correcting LLM Framework for Robotic Motion Planning with Temporal Logic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16767v1)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Translating natural language instructions into executable motion plans is a fundamental challenge in robotics. Traditional approaches are typically constrained by their reliance on domain-specific expertise to customize planners, and often struggle with spatio-temporal couplings that usually lead to infeasible motions or discrepancies between task planning and motion execution. Despite the proficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs) in high-level semantic reasoning, hallucination could result in infeasible motion plans. In this paper, we introduce the T3 Planner, an LLM-enabled robotic motion planning framework that self-corrects it output with formal methods. The framework decomposes spatio-temporal task constraints via three cascaded modules, each of which stimulates an LLM to generate candidate trajectory sequences and examines their feasibility via a Signal Temporal Logic (STL) verifier until one that satisfies complex spatial, temporal, and logical constraints is found.Experiments across different scenarios show that T3 Planner significantly outperforms the baselines. The required reasoning can be distilled into a lightweight Qwen3-4B model that enables efficient deployment.

| **[Intrinsic Self-Correction in LLMs: Towards Explainable Prompting via Mechanistic Interpretability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11924v2)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Intrinsic self-correction refers to the phenomenon where a language model refines its own outputs purely through prompting, without external feedback or parameter updates. While this approach improves performance across diverse tasks, its internal mechanism remains poorly understood. We analyze intrinsic self-correction from a representation-level perspective. We formalize and introduce the notion of a prompt-induced shift, which is the change in hidden representations caused by a self-correction prompt. Across 5 open-source LLMs, prompt-induced shifts in text detoxification and text toxification align with latent directions constructed from contrastive pairs. In detoxification, the shifts align with the non-toxic direction; in toxification, they align with the toxic direction. These results suggest that intrinsic self-correction functions as representation steering along interpretable latent directions, beyond what standard metrics such as task scores or model confidence capture. Our analysis offers an interpretability-based account of intrinsic self-correction and contributes to a more systematic understanding of LLM prompting.</p></details> |  |
| **[AgentAuditor: Human-Level Safety and Security Evaluation for LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00641v2)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the rapid advancement of LLM-based agents, the reliable evaluation of their safety and security remains a significant challenge. Existing rule-based or LLM-based evaluators often miss dangers in agents' step-by-step actions, overlook subtle meanings, fail to see how small issues compound, and get confused by unclear safety or security rules. To overcome this evaluation crisis, we introduce AgentAuditor, a universal, training-free, memory-augmented reasoning framework that empowers LLM evaluators to emulate human expert evaluators. AgentAuditor constructs an experiential memory by having an LLM adaptively extract structured semantic features (e.g., scenario, risk, behavior) and generate associated chain-of-thought reasoning traces for past interactions. A multi-stage, context-aware retrieval-augmented generation process then dynamically retrieves the most relevant reasoning experiences to guide the LLM evaluator's assessment of new cases. Moreover, we developed ASSEBench, the first benchmark designed to check how well LLM-based evaluators can spot both safety risks and security threats. ASSEBench comprises 2293 meticulously annotated interaction records, covering 15 risk types across 29 application scenarios. A key feature of ASSEBench is its nuanced approach to ambiguous risk situations, employing "Strict" and "Lenient" judgment standards. Experiments demonstrate that AgentAuditor not only consistently improves the evaluation performance of LLMs across all benchmarks but also sets a new state-of-the-art in LLM-as-a-judge for agent safety and security, achieving human-level accuracy. Our work is openly accessible at https://github.com/Astarojth/AgentAuditor.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by 39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025)</p></details> |
| **[DistilLock: Safeguarding LLMs from Unauthorized Knowledge Distillation on the Edge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16716v1)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance across diverse tasks, but fine-tuning them typically relies on cloud-based, centralized infrastructures. This requires data owners to upload potentially sensitive data to external servers, raising serious privacy concerns. An alternative approach is to fine-tune LLMs directly on edge devices using local data; however, this introduces a new challenge: the model owner must transfer proprietary models to the edge, which risks intellectual property (IP) leakage. To address this dilemma, we propose DistilLock, a TEE-assisted fine-tuning framework that enables privacy-preserving knowledge distillation on the edge. In DistilLock, a proprietary foundation model is executed within a trusted execution environment (TEE) enclave on the data owner's device, acting as a secure black-box teacher. This setup preserves both data privacy and model IP by preventing direct access to model internals. Furthermore, DistilLock employs a model obfuscation mechanism to offload obfuscated weights to untrusted accelerators for efficient knowledge distillation without compromising security. We demonstrate that DistilLock prevents unauthorized knowledge distillation processes and model-stealing attacks while maintaining high computational efficiency, but offering a secure and practical solution for edge-based LLM personalization.</p></details> |  |

Each poem's whitespace distribution reflects the artistic choices of the poet and is an integral semantic and spatial feature of the poem. Yet, despite the popularity of poetry as both a long-standing art form and as a generation task for large language models (LLMs), whitespace has not received sufficient attention from the NLP community. Using a corpus of 19k English-language published poems from Poetry Foundation, we investigate how 4k poets have used whitespace in their works. We release a subset of 2.8k public-domain poems with preserved formatting to facilitate further research in this area. We compare whitespace usage in the published poems to (1) 51k LLM-generated poems, and (2) 12k unpublished poems posted in an online community. We also explore whitespace usage across time periods, poetic forms, and data sources. Additionally, we find that different text processing methods can result in significantly different representations of whitespace in poetry data, motivating us to use these poems and whitespace patterns to discuss implications for the processing strategies used to assemble pretraining datasets for LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Chameleon Nature of LLMs: Quantifying Multi-Turn Stance Instability in Search-Enabled Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16712v1)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Integration of Large Language Models with search/retrieval engines has become ubiquitous, yet these systems harbor a critical vulnerability that undermines their reliability. We present the first systematic investigation of "chameleon behavior" in LLMs: their alarming tendency to shift stances when presented with contradictory questions in multi-turn conversations (especially in search-enabled LLMs). Through our novel Chameleon Benchmark Dataset, comprising 17,770 carefully crafted question-answer pairs across 1,180 multi-turn conversations spanning 12 controversial domains, we expose fundamental flaws in state-of-the-art systems. We introduce two theoretically grounded metrics: the Chameleon Score (0-1) that quantifies stance instability, and Source Re-use Rate (0-1) that measures knowledge diversity. Our rigorous evaluation of Llama-4-Maverick, GPT-4o-mini, and Gemini-2.5-Flash reveals consistent failures: all models exhibit severe chameleon behavior (scores 0.391-0.511), with GPT-4o-mini showing the worst performance. Crucially, small across-temperature variance (less than 0.004) suggests the effect is not a sampling artifact. Our analysis uncovers the mechanism: strong correlations between source re-use rate and confidence (r=0.627) and stance changes (r=0.429) are statistically significant (p less than 0.05), indicating that limited knowledge diversity makes models pathologically deferential to query framing. These findings highlight the need for comprehensive consistency evaluation before deploying LLMs in healthcare, legal, and financial systems where maintaining coherent positions across interactions is critical for reliable decision support.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Vision for Access Control in LLM-based Agent Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11108v2)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The autonomy and contextual complexity of LLM-based agents render traditional access control (AC) mechanisms insufficient. Static, rule-based systems designed for predictable environments are fundamentally ill-equipped to manage the dynamic information flows inherent in agentic interactions. This position paper argues for a paradigm shift from binary access control to a more sophisticated model of information governance, positing that the core challenge is not merely about permission, but about governing the flow of information. We introduce Agent Access Control (AAC), a novel framework that reframes AC as a dynamic, context-aware process of information flow governance. AAC operates on two core modules: (1) multi-dimensional contextual evaluation, which assesses not just identity but also relationships, scenarios, and norms; and (2) adaptive response formulation, which moves beyond simple allow/deny decisions to shape information through redaction, summarization, and paraphrasing. This vision, powered by a dedicated AC reasoning engine, aims to bridge the gap between human-like nuanced judgment and scalable Al safety, proposing a new conceptual lens for future research in trustworthy agent design.</p></details> | 11 pages, 1 figure |
| **[An Agentic Framework with LLMs for Solving Complex Vehicle Routing Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16701v1)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Complex vehicle routing problems (VRPs) remain a fundamental challenge, demanding substantial expert effort for intent interpretation and algorithm design. While large language models (LLMs) offer a promising path toward automation, current approaches still rely on external intervention, which restrict autonomy and often lead to execution errors and low solution feasibility. To address these challenges, we propose an Agentic Framework with LLMs (AFL) for solving complex vehicle routing problems, achieving full automation from problem instance to solution. AFL directly extracts knowledge from raw inputs and enables self-contained code generation without handcrafted modules or external solvers. To improve trustworthiness, AFL decomposes the overall pipeline into three manageable subtasks and employs four specialized agents whose coordinated interactions enforce cross-functional consistency and logical soundness. Extensive experiments on 60 complex VRPs, ranging from standard benchmarks to practical variants, validate the effectiveness and generality of our framework, showing comparable performance against meticulously designed algorithms. Notably, it substantially outperforms existing LLM-based baselines in both code reliability and solution feasibility, achieving rates close to 100% on the evaluated benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Efficiency and Exploration in Reinforcement Learning for LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18573v2)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning large language models (LLMs) excel in complex tasks, which has drawn significant attention to reinforcement learning (RL) for LLMs. However, existing approaches allocate an equal number of rollouts to all questions during the RL process, which is inefficient. This inefficiency stems from the fact that training on simple questions yields limited gains, whereas more rollouts are needed for challenging questions to sample correct answers. Furthermore, while RL improves response precision, it limits the model's exploration ability, potentially resulting in a performance cap below that of the base model prior to RL. To address these issues, we propose a mechanism for dynamically allocating rollout budgets based on the difficulty of the problems, enabling more efficient RL training. Additionally, we introduce an adaptive dynamic temperature adjustment strategy to maintain the entropy at a stable level, thereby encouraging sufficient exploration. This enables LLMs to improve response precision while preserving their exploratory ability to uncover potential correct pathways.

Incorporating rationales, either by generating them before answering during inference, or by placing them before or after the original answers during training - significantly improves model performance on mathematical, symbolic and commonsense reasoning tasks. However, most work focuses on the role of rationales in these reasoning tasks, overlooking their potential impact on other important tasks like natural language understanding (NLU) tasks. In this work, we raise the question: Can rationales similarly benefit NLU tasks? To conduct a systematic exploration, we construct NLURC, a comprehensive and high-quality NLU dataset collection with rationales, and develop various rationale-augmented methods. Through exploring the applicability of these methods on NLU tasks using the dataset, we uncover several potentially surprising findings: (1) CoT inference shifts from hindering NLU performance to surpassing direct label prediction as model size grows, indicating a positive correlation. (2) Most rationale-augmented training methods perform worse than label-only training, with one specially designed method consistently achieving improvements. (3) LLMs trained with rationales achieve significant performance gains on unseen NLU tasks, rivaling models ten times their size, while delivering interpretability on par with commercial LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Attack via Overfitting: 10-shot Benign Fine-tuning to Jailbreak LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02833v3)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite substantial efforts in safety alignment, recent research indicates that Large Language Models (LLMs) remain highly susceptible to jailbreak attacks. Among these attacks, finetuning-based ones that compromise LLMs' safety alignment via fine-tuning stand out due to its stable jailbreak performance. In particular, a recent study indicates that fine-tuning with as few as 10 harmful question-answer (QA) pairs can lead to successful jailbreaking across various harmful questions. However, such malicious fine-tuning attacks are readily detectable and hence thwarted by moderation models. In this paper, we demonstrate that LLMs can be jailbroken by fine-tuning with only 10 benign QA pairs; our attack exploits the increased sensitivity of LLMs to fine-tuning data after being overfitted. Specifically, our fine-tuning process starts with overfitting an LLM via fine-tuning with benign QA pairs involving identical refusal answers. Further fine-tuning is then performed with standard benign answers, causing the overfitted LLM to forget the refusal attitude and thus provide compliant answers regardless of the harmfulness of a question. We implement our attack on the ten LLMs and compare it with five existing baselines. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves significant advantages in both attack effectiveness and attack stealth. Our findings expose previously unreported security vulnerabilities in current LLMs and provide a new perspective on understanding how LLMs' security is compromised, even with benign fine-tuning.

This enables LLMs to act as effective multi-turn conversational agents and interactively interface with external environments. Our approach, which we call BED-LLM (Bayesian Experimental Design with Large Language Models), is based on iteratively choosing questions or queries that maximize the expected information gain (EIG) about the task of interest given the responses gathered previously. We show how this EIG can be formulated (and then estimated) in a principled way using a probabilistic model derived from the LLM's predictive distributions and provide detailed insights into key decisions in its construction and updating procedure. We find that BED-LLM achieves substantial gains in performance across a wide range of tests based on the 20 questions game and using the LLM to actively infer user preferences, compared to direct prompting of the LLM and other adaptive design strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Knapsack by Any Other Name: Presentation impacts LLM performance on NP-hard problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13776v2)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To investigate the effect of problem presentation on LLMs' ability to solve optimization problems, we introduce the dataset of Everyday Hard Optimization Problems (EHOP), a collection of NP-hard problems expressed in natural language. EHOP includes problem formulations that could be found in computer science textbooks (e.g., graph coloring), versions that are dressed up as problems that could arise in real life (e.g., party planning), and variants with inverted rules. We find that state-of-the-art LLMs, across multiple prompting strategies, systematically solve textbook problems more accurately than their real-life and inverted counterparts. While reasoning models are more capable, they nonetheless show high variance across problem presentations, suggesting they lack a truly robust reasoning mechanism. We argue that this constitutes evidence that LLMs are still heavily dependent on what was seen in training and struggle to generalize to novel problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 6 figures, EMNLP 2025</p></details> |

This paper introduces the Multi-Agent Collaboration Framework for Diverse Thinking Modes (DiMo), which enhances both performance and interpretability by simulating a structured debate among four specialized LLM agents. Each agent embodies a distinct reasoning paradigm, allowing the framework to collaboratively explore diverse cognitive approaches. Through iterative debate, agents challenge and refine initial responses, yielding more robust conclusions and an explicit, auditable reasoning chain. Across six benchmarks and under a unified open-source setup, DiMo improves accuracy over widely used single-model and debate baselines, with the largest gains on math. We position DiMo as a semantics-aware, Web-native multi-agent framework: it models human-machine intelligence with LLM agents that produce semantically typed, URL-annotated evidence chains for explanations and user-friendly interactions. Although our experiments use standard reasoning benchmarks, the framework is designed to be instantiated over Web corpora and knowledge graphs, combining retrieval-augmented reasoning with structured justifications that downstream systems can inspect and reuse.</p></details> |  |
| **[Count Counts: Motivating Exploration in LLM Reasoning with Count-based Intrinsic Rewards](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16614v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become a compelling way to strengthen the multi step reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, prevalent RL paradigms still lean on sparse outcome-based rewards and limited exploration, which often drives LLMs toward repetitive and suboptimal reasoning patterns. In this paper, we study the central question of how to design exploration for LLM reasoning and introduce MERCI (Motivating Exploration in LLM Reasoning with Count-based Intrinsic Rewards), a novel RL algorithm that augments policy optimization with a principled intrinsic reward. Building on the idea of count-based exploration, MERCI leverages a lightweight Coin Flipping Network (CFN) to estimate the pseudo count and further epistemic uncertainty over reasoning trajectories, and converts them into an intrinsic reward that values novelty while preserving the learning signal from task rewards. We integrate MERCI into some advanced RL frameworks like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Experiments on complex reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that MERCI encourages richer and more varied chains of thought, significantly improves performance over strong baselines, and helps the policy escape local routines to discover better solutions. It indicates that our targeted intrinsic motivation can make exploration reliable for language model reasoning.</p></details> |  |

Ontologies structure domain knowledge, enabling interoperability, data integration, and advanced threat analysis. Security logs, though critical, are often unstructured and complex. To address this, automated construction of Knowledge Graphs (KGs) from raw logs is emerging as a key strategy for organizing and reasoning over security data. LLMs enrich this process by providing contextual understanding and extracting insights from unstructured content. This work aligns with European Union (EU) efforts such as NIS 2 and the Cybersecurity Taxonomy, highlighting challenges and opportunities in intelligent ontology-driven cyber defense.</p></details> |  |

With llm now powering multi-agent systems and social simulations, we are witnessing new possibilities for modeling open-ended, ever-changing environments. Yet, most current simulations remain constrained within static sandboxes, characterized by predefined tasks, limited dynamics, and rigid evaluation criteria. These limitations prevent them from capturing the complexity of real-world societies. In this paper, we argue that static, task-specific benchmarks are fundamentally inadequate and must be rethought. We critically review emerging architectures that blend llm with multi-agent dynamics, highlight key hurdles such as balancing stability and diversity, evaluating unexpected behaviors, and scaling to greater complexity, and introduce a fresh taxonomy for this rapidly evolving field. Finally, we present a research roadmap centered on open-endedness, continuous co-evolution, and the development of resilient, socially aligned AI ecosystems. We call on the community to move beyond static paradigms and help shape the next generation of adaptive, socially-aware multi-agent simulations.</p></details> |  |

While models display impressive accuracy on factual question-answering benchmarks, the reliability gap between simple and complex queries remains poorly understood, eroding their trustworthiness. In this work, we introduce Short-Long Form Alignment for Factual Question Answering (SLAQ), a controlled evaluation framework that compares LLMs' answers to the same factual questions asked (a) in isolation (short) vs. (b) integrated into complex queries (long). Looking at 16 LLMs across 600 queries, we find a systematic misalignment of answers to the corresponding short and long queries. We further uncover position-dependent accuracy loss and momentum effects where consecutive correct or incorrect answers create self-reinforcing patterns. Through mechanistic analysis, we find that aligned facts activate overlapping model internals, and that metrics based on mechanistic similarity can predict short-long answer alignment with up to 78% accuracy. Our work establishes factual consistency over query complexity as an important aspect of LLMs' trustworthiness and challenges current evaluation practices, which implicitly assume that good performance for simple factual queries implies reliability in more complex knowledge-seeking tasks too.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/WorldHellow/SLAQ/tree/main</p></details> |

While most existing research concentrates on theoretical properties (such as well-posedness, regularity, and continuity) of the solutions, alongside direct AI-driven methods for solving PDEs, the challenge of uncovering symbolic relationships within these equations remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose leveraging large language models (LLMs) to learn such symbolic relationships. Our results demonstrate that LLMs can effectively predict the operators involved in PDE solutions by utilizing the symbolic information in the PDEs both theoretically and numerically. Furthermore, we show that discovering these symbolic relationships can substantially improve both the efficiency and accuracy of symbolic machine learning for finding analytical approximation of PDE solutions, delivering a fully interpretable solution pipeline. This work opens new avenues for understanding the symbolic structure of scientific problems and advancing their solution processes.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce a framework for molecular reasoning using general-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) that operates without requiring labeled training data. Our method anchors chain-of-thought reasoning to the molecular structure by using unique atomic identifiers. First, the LLM performs a one-shot task to identify relevant fragments and their associated chemical labels or transformation classes. In an optional second step, this position-aware information is used in a few-shot task with provided class examples to predict the chemical transformation. We apply our framework to single-step retrosynthesis, a task where LLMs have previously underperformed. Across academic benchmarks and expert-validated drug discovery molecules, our work enables LLMs to achieve high success rates in identifying chemically plausible reaction sites ($\geq90\%$), named reaction classes ($\geq40\%$), and final reactants ($\geq74\%$). Beyond solving complex chemical tasks, our work also provides a method to generate theoretically grounded synthetic datasets by mapping chemical knowledge onto the molecular structure and thereby addressing data scarcity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Alan ...</summary><p>Alan Kai Hassen and Andrius Bernatavicius contributed equally to this work</p></details> |

However, current LLM-based approaches predominantly focus on mainstream programming languages like Java and Python, neglecting less prevalent but emerging languages such as Rust due to expensive training resources, limited datasets, and insufficient community support. This narrow focus creates a significant gap in repair capabilities across the programming language spectrum, where the full potential of LLMs for comprehensive multilingual program repair remains largely unexplored. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel cross-language program repair approach LANTERN that leverages LLMs' differential proficiency across languages through a multi-agent iterative repair paradigm. Our technique strategically translates defective code from languages where LLMs exhibit weaker repair capabilities to languages where they demonstrate stronger performance, without requiring additional training. A key innovation of our approach is an LLM-based decision-making system that dynamically selects optimal target languages based on bug characteristics and continuously incorporates feedback from previous repair attempts. We evaluate our method on xCodeEval, a comprehensive multilingual benchmark comprising 5,068 bugs across 11 programming languages. Results demonstrate significant enhancement in repair effectiveness, particularly for underrepresented languages, with Rust showing a 22.09% improvement in Pass@10 metrics. Our research provides the first empirical evidence that cross-language translation significantly expands the repair capabilities of LLMs and effectively bridges the performance gap between programming languages with different levels of popularity, opening new avenues for truly language-agnostic automated program repair.</p></details> |  |

Evaluating such refactorings, however, remains difficult: metrics like CodeBLEU penalize beneficial renamings and edits, while semantic similarities overlook readability and modularity. We propose CTSES, a first step toward human-aligned evaluation of refactored tests. CTSES combines CodeBLEU, METEOR, and ROUGE-L into a composite score that balances semantics, lexical clarity, and structural alignment. Evaluated on 5,000+ refactorings from Defects4J and SF110 (GPT-4o and Mistral-Large), CTSES reduces false negatives and provides more interpretable signals than individual metrics. Our emerging results illustrate that CTSES offers a proof-of-concept for composite approaches, showing their promise in bridging automated metrics and developer judgments.</p></details> |  |
| **[ToMAP: Training Opponent-Aware LLM Persuaders with Theory of Mind](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22961v2)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising potential in persuasion, but existing works on training LLM persuaders are still preliminary. Notably, while humans are skilled in modeling their opponent's thoughts and opinions proactively and dynamically, current LLMs struggle with such Theory of Mind (ToM) reasoning, resulting in limited diversity and opponent awareness. To address this limitation, we introduce Theory of Mind Augmented Persuader (ToMAP), a novel approach for building more flexible persuader agents by incorporating two theory of mind modules that enhance the persuader's awareness and analysis of the opponent's mental state. Specifically, we begin by prompting the persuader to consider possible objections to the target central claim, and then use a text encoder paired with a trained MLP classifier to predict the opponent's current stance on these counterclaims. Our carefully designed reinforcement learning schema enables the persuader learns how to analyze opponent-related information and utilize it to generate more effective arguments. Experiments show that the ToMAP persuader, while containing only 3B parameters, outperforms much larger baselines, like GPT-4o, with a relative gain of 39.4% across multiple persuadee models and diverse corpora. Notably, ToMAP exhibits complex reasoning chains and reduced repetition during training, which leads to more diverse and effective arguments. The opponent-aware feature of ToMAP also makes it suitable for long conversations and enables it to employ more logical and opponent-aware strategies. These results underscore our method's effectiveness and highlight its potential for developing more persuasive language agents.

While modern LLMs possess broad knowledge and strong reasoning capabilities that make them promising candidates for this domain, their construction competencies remain largely unevaluated. To address this gap, we introduce BuildArena, the first physics-aligned interactive benchmark designed for language-driven engineering construction. It contributes to the community in four aspects: (1) a highly customizable benchmarking framework for in-depth comparison and analysis of LLMs; (2) an extendable task design strategy spanning static and dynamic mechanics across multiple difficulty tiers; (3) a 3D Spatial Geometric Computation Library for supporting construction based on language instructions; (4) a baseline LLM agentic workflow that effectively evaluates diverse model capabilities.

While LLMs can uniquely learn from language feedback provided in-context, naively integrating on-line experiences into RL training presents a paradox: feedback from the same problem risks information leakage and memorization, while feedback from different problems often leads to behavior collapse due to irrelevant context. To resolve this tension, we propose \textbf{Language-And-Numerical Policy Optimization (LANPO)}, a framework that cleanly separates the roles of feedback: language guides exploration, while numerical rewards drive optimization. LANPO builds a dynamic experience pool from past trials and introduces two principles to ensure feedback is effective: \emph{Reward-Agnostic Reflection} for safe intra-sample self-correction and \emph{Relevant Abstraction} to distill generalizable lessons from inter-sample experiences. Across mathematical reasoning benchmarks, LANPO enables 7B and 14B models to significantly outperform strong baselines trained with GRPO in test accuracy. Our work provides a robust method for integrating historical experiences into the LLM RL loop, creating more effective and data-efficient learning agents.</p></details> |  |

Grounded in marketing theory, the framework distinguishes perceptual attributes from actionable features, producing interpretable and managerially actionable insights. We apply the methodology to 20,000 Yelp reviews of Starbucks stores and evaluate eight prompt variants on a random subset of reviews. Model performance is assessed through agreement with human annotations and predictive validity for customer ratings. Results show high consistency between LLMs and human coders and strong predictive validity, confirming the reliability of the approach. Human coders required a median of six minutes per review, whereas the LLM processed each in two seconds, delivering comparable insights at a scale unattainable through manual coding. Managerially, the analysis identifies attributes and features that most strongly influence customer satisfaction and their associated sentiments, enabling firms to pinpoint "joy points," address "pain points," and design targeted interventions. We demonstrate how structured review data can power an actionable marketing dashboard that tracks sentiment over time and across stores, benchmarks performance, and highlights high-leverage features for improvement. Simulations indicate that enhancing sentiment for key service features could yield 1-2% average revenue gains per store.</p></details> |  |

Recent work has focused on using LLMs to improve review efficiency or generate insightful review content. However, unchecked deficient reviews from both human experts and AI systems threaten to systematically undermine the peer review ecosystem and compromise academic integrity. To address this critical issue, we introduce ReviewGuard, an automated system for detecting and categorizing deficient reviews. ReviewGuard employs a comprehensive four-stage LLM-driven framework that: (1) collects ICLR and NeurIPS papers with their corresponding reviews from OpenReview; (2) annotates review types using GPT-4.1 with human validation; (3) addresses class imbalance and data scarcity through LLM-driven synthetic data augmentation, producing a final corpus of 6,634 papers, 24,657 real reviews, and 46,438 synthetic reviews; and (4) fine-tunes both encoder-based models and open source LLMs. We perform comprehensive feature analysis of the structure and quality of the review text. Compared to sufficient reviews, deficient reviews demonstrate lower rating scores, higher self-reported confidence, reduced structural complexity, and a higher proportion of negative sentiment. AI-generated text detection reveals that, since ChatGPT's emergence, AI-generated reviews have increased dramatically. In the evaluation of deficient review detection models, mixed training with synthetic and real review data provides substantial enhancements to recall and F1 scores on the binary task. This study presents the first LLM-driven system for detecting deficient peer reviews, providing evidence to inform AI governance in peer review while offering valuable insights into human-AI collaboration to maintain academic integrity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Realizing LLMs' Causal Potential Requires Science-Grounded, Novel Benchmarks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16530v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent claims of strong performance by Large Language Models (LLMs) on causal discovery are undermined by a key flaw: many evaluations rely on benchmarks likely included in pretraining corpora. Thus, apparent success suggests that LLM-only methods, which ignore observational data, outperform classical statistical approaches. We challenge this narrative by asking: Do LLMs truly reason about causal structure, and how can we measure it without memorization concerns? Can they be trusted for real-world scientific discovery? We argue that realizing LLMs' potential for causal analysis requires two shifts: (P.1) developing robust evaluation protocols based on recent scientific studies to guard against dataset leakage, and (P.2) designing hybrid methods that combine LLM-derived knowledge with data-driven statistics. To address P.1, we encourage evaluating discovery methods on novel, real-world scientific studies. We outline a practical recipe for extracting causal graphs from recent publications released after an LLM's training cutoff, ensuring relevance and preventing memorization while capturing both established and novel relations. Compared to benchmarks like BNLearn, where LLMs achieve near-perfect accuracy, they perform far worse on our curated graphs, underscoring the need for statistical grounding. Supporting P.2, we show that using LLM predictions as priors for the classical PC algorithm significantly improves accuracy over both LLM-only and purely statistical methods. We call on the community to adopt science-grounded, leakage-resistant benchmarks and invest in hybrid causal discovery methods suited to real-world inquiry.</p></details> |  |

While persuasion-based optimization has shown promise in debate settings, it has not been systematically compared against mainstream truth-based approaches. We introduce DebateQD, a minimal Quality-Diversity (QD) evolutionary algorithm that evolves diverse debate strategies across different categories (rationality, authority, emotional appeal, etc.) through tournament-style competitions where two LLMs debate while a third judges. Unlike previously proposed methods that require a population of LLMs, our approach maintains diversity of opponents through prompt-based strategies within a single LLM architecture, making it more accessible for experiments while preserving the key benefits of population-based optimization. In contrast to prior work, we explicitly isolate the role of the optimization objective by fixing the debate protocol and swapping only the fitness function: persuasion rewards strategies that convince the judge irrespective of truth, whereas truth rewards collaborative correctness. Across three model scales (7B, 32B, 72B parameters) and multiple dataset sizes from the QuALITY benchmark, persuasion-optimized strategies achieve up to 13.94% smaller train-test generalization gaps, while matching or exceeding truth optimization's test performance. These results provide the first controlled evidence that competitive pressure to persuade, rather than seek the truth collaboratively, fosters more transferable reasoning skills, offering a promising path for improving LLM generalization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Open-...</summary><p>Open-source code available at https://github.com/flowersteam/llm_persuasion</p></details> |

Here we present the StarWhisper Telescope system, an AI agent framework automating end-to-end astronomical observations for surveys like the Nearby Galaxy Supernovae Survey. By integrating large language models with specialized function calls and modular workflows, StarWhisper Telescope autonomously generates site-specific observation lists, executes real-time image analysis via pipelines, and dynamically triggers follow-up proposals upon transient detection. The system reduces human intervention through automated observation planning, telescope controlling and data processing, while enabling seamless collaboration between amateur and professional astronomers. Deployed across Nearby Galaxy Supernovae Survey's network of 10 amateur telescopes, the StarWhisper Telescope has detected transients with promising response times relative to existing surveys. Furthermore, StarWhisper Telescope's scalable agent architecture provides a blueprint for future facilities like the Global Open Transient Telescope Array, where AI-driven autonomy will be critical for managing 60 telescopes.</p></details> | 33 pages |

| **[Small Models are LLM Knowledge Triggers on Medical Tabular Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01570v3)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent development in large language models (LLMs) has demonstrated impressive domain proficiency on unstructured textual or multi-modal tasks. However, despite with intrinsic world knowledge, their application on structured tabular data prediction still lags behind, primarily due to the numerical insensitivity and modality discrepancy that brings a gap between LLM reasoning and statistical tabular learning. Unlike textual or vision data (e.g., electronic clinical notes or medical imaging data), tabular data is often presented in heterogeneous numerical values (e.g., CBC reports). This ubiquitous data format requires intensive expert annotation, and its numerical nature limits LLMs' capability to effectively transfer untapped domain expertise. In this paper, we propose SERSAL, a general self-prompting method by synergy learning with small models to enhance LLM tabular prediction in an unsupervised manner. Specifically, SERSAL utilizes the LLM's prior outcomes as original soft noisy annotations, which are dynamically leveraged to teach a better small student model. Reversely, the outcomes from the trained small model are used to teach the LLM to further refine its real capability. This process can be repeatedly applied to gradually distill refined knowledge for continuous progress. Comprehensive experiments on widely used medical domain tabular datasets show that, without access to gold labels, applying SERSAL to OpenAI GPT reasoning process attains substantial improvement compared to linguistic prompting methods, which serves as an orthogonal direction for tabular LLM, and increasing prompting bonus is observed as more powerful LLMs appear.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025.

| **[Elephants Never Forget: Memorization and Learning of Tabular Data in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06209v3)** | 2024-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While many have shown how Large Language Models (LLMs) can be applied to a diverse set of tasks, the critical issues of data contamination and memorization are often glossed over. In this work, we address this concern for tabular data. Specifically, we introduce a variety of different techniques to assess whether a language model has seen a tabular dataset during training. This investigation reveals that LLMs have memorized many popular tabular datasets verbatim. We then compare the few-shot learning performance of LLMs on datasets that were seen during training to the performance on datasets released after training. We find that LLMs perform better on datasets seen during training, indicating that memorization leads to overfitting. At the same time, LLMs show non-trivial performance on novel datasets and are surprisingly robust to data transformations. We then investigate the in-context statistical learning abilities of LLMs. While LLMs are significantly better than random at solving statistical classification problems, the sample efficiency of few-shot learning lags behind traditional statistical learning algorithms, especially as the dimension of the problem increases. This suggests that much of the observed few-shot performance on novel real-world datasets is due to the LLM's world knowledge. Overall, our results highlight the importance of testing whether an LLM has seen an evaluation dataset during pre-training. We release the https://github.com/interpretml/LLM-Tabular-Memorization-Checker Python package to test LLMs for memorization of tabular datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>COLM ...</summary><p>COLM camera ready, fix typo</p></details> |

Since it is impossible to generalize to a completely new and unknown domain, we study models that are easy to adapt to the target domain even with few labeled examples. We focus on building more informative representations of tabular data that can mitigate $Y|X$-shifts, and propose to leverage the prior world knowledge in LLMs by serializing (write down) the tabular data to encode it. We find LLM embeddings alone provide inconsistent improvements in robustness, but models trained on them can be well adapted/finetuned to the target domain even using 32 labeled observations. Our finding is based on a comprehensive and systematic study consisting of 7650 source-target pairs and benchmark against 261,000 model configurations trained by 22 algorithms. Our observation holds when ablating the size of accessible target data and different adaptation strategies.

| **[Elephants Never Forget: Testing Language Models for Memorization of Tabular Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06644v1)** | 2024-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While many have shown how Large Language Models (LLMs) can be applied to a diverse set of tasks, the critical issues of data contamination and memorization are often glossed over. In this work, we address this concern for tabular data. Starting with simple qualitative tests for whether an LLM knows the names and values of features, we introduce a variety of different techniques to assess the degrees of contamination, including statistical tests for conditional distribution modeling and four tests that identify memorization. Our investigation reveals that LLMs are pre-trained on many popular tabular datasets. This exposure can lead to invalid performance evaluation on downstream tasks because the LLMs have, in effect, been fit to the test set. Interestingly, we also identify a regime where the language model reproduces important statistics of the data, but fails to reproduce the dataset verbatim. On these datasets, although seen during training, good performance on downstream tasks might not be due to overfitting. Our findings underscore the need for ensuring data integrity in machine learning tasks with LLMs. To facilitate future research, we release an open-source tool that can perform various tests for memorization \url{https://github.com/interpretml/LLM-Tabular-Memorization-Checker}.</p></details> | <details><summary>Table...</summary><p>Table Representation Learning Workshop at NeurIPS 2023</p></details> |
