| **[Reward-RAG: Enhancing RAG with Reward Driven Supervision](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.03780v1)** | 2024-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce Reward-RAG, a novel approach designed to enhance the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model through Reward-Driven Supervision. Unlike previous RAG methodologies, which focus on training language models (LMs) to utilize external knowledge retrieved from external sources, our method adapts retrieval information to specific domains by employing CriticGPT to train a dedicated reward model. This reward model generates synthesized datasets for fine-tuning the RAG encoder, aligning its outputs more closely with human preferences. The versatility of our approach allows it to be effectively applied across various domains through domain-specific fine-tuning. We evaluate Reward-RAG on publicly available benchmarks from multiple domains, comparing it to state-of-the-art methods. Our experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in performance, highlighting the effectiveness of Reward-RAG in improving the relevance and quality of generated responses. These findings underscore the potential of integrating reward models with RAG to achieve superior outcomes in natural language generation tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[DoTA-RAG: Dynamic of Thought Aggregation RAG](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.12571v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce DoTA-RAG (Dynamic-of-Thought Aggregation RAG), a retrieval-augmented generation system optimized for high-throughput, large-scale web knowledge indexes. Traditional RAG pipelines often suffer from high latency and limited accuracy over massive, diverse datasets. DoTA-RAG addresses these challenges with a three-stage pipeline: query rewriting, dynamic routing to specialized sub-indexes, and multi-stage retrieval and ranking. We further enhance retrieval by evaluating and selecting a superior embedding model, re-embedding the large FineWeb-10BT corpus. Moreover, we create a diverse Q&A dataset of 500 questions generated via the DataMorgana setup across a broad range of WebOrganizer topics and formats. DoTA-RAG improves the answer correctness score from 0.752 (baseline, using LiveRAG pre-built vector store) to 1.478 while maintaining low latency, and it achieves a 0.929 correctness score on the Live Challenge Day. These results highlight DoTA-RAG's potential for practical deployment in domains requiring fast, reliable access to large and evolving knowledge sources.</p></details> | <details><summary>SIGIR...</summary><p>SIGIR LiveRAG 2025 (oral presentation)</p></details> |
| **[RAGGED: Towards Informed Design of Scalable and Stable RAG Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.09040v3)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances language models by integrating external knowledge, but its effectiveness is highly dependent on system configuration. Improper retrieval settings can degrade performance, making RAG less reliable than closed-book generation. In this work, we introduce RAGGED, a framework for systematically evaluating RAG systems across diverse retriever-reader configurations, retrieval depths, and datasets. Our analysis reveals that reader robustness to noise is the key determinant of RAG stability and scalability. Some readers benefit from increased retrieval depth, while others degrade due to their sensitivity to distracting content. Through large-scale experiments on open-domain, multi-hop, and specialized-domain datasets, we show that retrievers, rerankers, and prompts influence performance but do not fundamentally alter these reader-driven trends. By providing a principled framework and new metrics to assess RAG stability and scalability, RAGGED enables systematic evaluation of retrieval-augmented generation systems, guiding future research on optimizing retrieval depth and model robustness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://github.com/neulab/ragged</p></details> |
| **[Modular RAG: Transforming RAG Systems into LEGO-like Reconfigurable Frameworks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.21059v1)** | 2024-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) has markedly enhanced the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in tackling knowledge-intensive tasks. The increasing demands of application scenarios have driven the evolution of RAG, leading to the integration of advanced retrievers, LLMs and other complementary technologies, which in turn has amplified the intricacy of RAG systems. However, the rapid advancements are outpacing the foundational RAG paradigm, with many methods struggling to be unified under the process of "retrieve-then-generate". In this context, this paper examines the limitations of the existing RAG paradigm and introduces the modular RAG framework. By decomposing complex RAG systems into independent modules and specialized operators, it facilitates a highly reconfigurable framework. Modular RAG transcends the traditional linear architecture, embracing a more advanced design that integrates routing, scheduling, and fusion mechanisms. Drawing on extensive research, this paper further identifies prevalent RAG patterns-linear, conditional, branching, and looping-and offers a comprehensive analysis of their respective implementation nuances. Modular RAG presents innovative opportunities for the conceptualization and deployment of RAG systems. Finally, the paper explores the potential emergence of new operators and paradigms, establishing a solid theoretical foundation and a practical roadmap for the continued evolution and practical deployment of RAG technologies.</p></details> |  |
| **[RAG-Stack: Co-Optimizing RAG Quality and Performance From the Vector Database Perspective](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.20296v1)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as one of the most prominent applications of vector databases. By integrating documents retrieved from a database into the prompt of a large language model (LLM), RAG enables more reliable and informative content generation. While there has been extensive research on vector databases, many open research problems remain once they are considered in the wider context of end-to-end RAG pipelines. One practical yet challenging problem is how to jointly optimize both system performance and generation quality in RAG, which is significantly more complex than it appears due to the numerous knobs on both the algorithmic side (spanning models and databases) and the systems side (from software to hardware). In this paper, we present RAG-Stack, a three-pillar blueprint for quality-performance co-optimization in RAG systems. RAG-Stack comprises: (1) RAG-IR, an intermediate representation that serves as an abstraction layer to decouple quality and performance aspects; (2) RAG-CM, a cost model for estimating system performance given an RAG-IR; and (3) RAG-PE, a plan exploration algorithm that searches for high-quality, high-performance RAG configurations. We believe this three-pillar blueprint will become the de facto paradigm for RAG quality-performance co-optimization in the years to come.</p></details> |  |
| **[PA-RAG: RAG Alignment via Multi-Perspective Preference Optimization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.14510v1)** | 2024-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has alleviated the issues of outdated and hallucinatory content in the generation of large language models (LLMs), yet it still reveals numerous limitations. When a general-purpose LLM serves as the RAG generator, it often suffers from inadequate response informativeness, response robustness, and citation quality. Past approaches to tackle these limitations, either by incorporating additional steps beyond generating responses or optimizing the generator through supervised fine-tuning (SFT), still failed to align with the RAG requirement thoroughly. Consequently, optimizing the RAG generator from multiple preference perspectives while maintaining its end-to-end LLM form remains a challenge. To bridge this gap, we propose Multiple Perspective Preference Alignment for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (PA-RAG), a method for optimizing the generator of RAG systems to align with RAG requirements comprehensively. Specifically, we construct high-quality instruction fine-tuning data and multi-perspective preference data by sampling varied quality responses from the generator across different prompt documents quality scenarios. Subsequently, we optimize the generator using SFT and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Extensive experiments conducted on four question-answer datasets across three LLMs demonstrate that PA-RAG can significantly enhance the performance of RAG generators. Our code and datasets are available at https://github.com/wujwyi/PA-RAG.</p></details> |  |
| **[RAG-Anything: All-in-One RAG Framework](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.12323v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a fundamental paradigm for expanding Large Language Models beyond their static training limitations. However, a critical misalignment exists between current RAG capabilities and real-world information environments. Modern knowledge repositories are inherently multimodal, containing rich combinations of textual content, visual elements, structured tables, and mathematical expressions. Yet existing RAG frameworks are limited to textual content, creating fundamental gaps when processing multimodal documents. We present RAG-Anything, a unified framework that enables comprehensive knowledge retrieval across all modalities. Our approach reconceptualizes multimodal content as interconnected knowledge entities rather than isolated data types. The framework introduces dual-graph construction to capture both cross-modal relationships and textual semantics within a unified representation. We develop cross-modal hybrid retrieval that combines structural knowledge navigation with semantic matching. This enables effective reasoning over heterogeneous content where relevant evidence spans multiple modalities. RAG-Anything demonstrates superior performance on challenging multimodal benchmarks, achieving significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods. Performance gains become particularly pronounced on long documents where traditional approaches fail. Our framework establishes a new paradigm for multimodal knowledge access, eliminating the architectural fragmentation that constrains current systems. Our framework is open-sourced at: https://github.com/HKUDS/RAG-Anything.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revisiting RAG Ensemble: A Theoretical and Mechanistic Analysis of Multi-RAG System Collaboration](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.13828v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology has been widely applied in recent years. However, despite the emergence of various RAG frameworks, a single RAG framework still cannot adapt well to a broad range of downstream tasks. Therefore, how to leverage the advantages of multiple RAG systems has become an area worth exploring. To address this issue, we have conducted a comprehensive and systematic investigation into ensemble methods based on RAG systems. Specifically, we have analyzed the RAG ensemble framework from both theoretical and mechanistic analysis perspectives. From the theoretical analysis, we provide the first explanation of the RAG ensemble framework from the perspective of information entropy. In terms of mechanism analysis, we have explored the RAG ensemble framework from both the pipeline and module levels. We carefully select four different pipelines (Branching, Iterative, Loop, and Agentic) and three different modules (Generator, Retriever, and Reranker) to solve seven different research questions. The experiments show that aggregating multiple RAG systems is both generalizable and robust, whether at the pipeline level or the module level. Our work lays the foundation for similar research on the multi-RAG system ensemble.</p></details> |  |
| **[MES-RAG: Bringing Multi-modal, Entity-Storage, and Secure Enhancements to RAG](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.13563v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) improves Large Language Models (LLMs) by using external knowledge, but it struggles with precise entity information retrieval. In this paper, we proposed MES-RAG framework, which enhances entity-specific query handling and provides accurate, secure, and consistent responses. MES-RAG introduces proactive security measures that ensure system integrity by applying protections prior to data access. Additionally, the system supports real-time multi-modal outputs, including text, images, audio, and video, seamlessly integrating into existing RAG architectures. Experimental results demonstrate that MES-RAG significantly improves both accuracy and recall, highlighting its effectiveness in advancing the security and utility of question-answering, increasing accuracy to 0.83 (+0.25) on targeted task. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/wpydcr/MES-RAG.</p></details> | NAACL 2025 |
| **[Stop-RAG: Value-Based Retrieval Control for Iterative RAG](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.14337v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Iterative retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enables large language models to answer complex multi-hop questions, but each additional loop increases latency, costs, and the risk of introducing distracting evidence, motivating the need for an efficient stopping strategy. Existing methods either use a predetermined number of iterations or rely on confidence proxies that poorly reflect whether more retrieval will actually help. We cast iterative RAG as a finite-horizon Markov decision process and introduce Stop-RAG, a value-based controller that adaptively decides when to stop retrieving. Trained with full-width forward-view Q($λ$) targets from complete trajectories, Stop-RAG learns effective stopping policies while remaining compatible with black-box APIs and existing pipelines. On multi-hop question-answering benchmarks, Stop-RAG consistently outperforms both fixed-iteration baselines and prompting-based stopping with LLMs. These results highlight adaptive stopping as a key missing component in current agentic systems, and demonstrate that value-based control can improve the accuracy of RAG systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 MTI-LLM Workshop</p></details> |
| **[KARE-RAG: Knowledge-Aware Refinement and Enhancement for RAG](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.02503v1)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enables large language models (LLMs) to access broader knowledge sources, yet factual inconsistencies persist due to noise in retrieved documents-even with advanced retrieval methods. We demonstrate that enhancing generative models' capacity to process noisy content is equally critical for robust performance. In this paper, we present KARE-RAG (Knowledge-Aware Refinement and Enhancement for RAG), which improves knowledge utilization through three key innovations: (1) structured knowledge representations that facilitate error detection during training, (2) Dense Direct Preference Optimization (DDPO)-a refined training objective that prioritizes correction of critical errors, and (3) a contrastive data generation pipeline that maintains semantic consistency while rectifying factual inaccuracies. Experiments show our method significantly enhances standard RAG pipelines across model scales, improving both in-domain and out-of-domain task performance without compromising general capabilities. Notably, these gains are achieved with modest training data, suggesting data-efficient optimization is possible through targeted learning strategies. Our findings establish a new direction for RAG improvement: by improving how models learn to process retrieved content, we can enhance performance across diverse inference paradigms. All data and code will be publicly available on Github.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Agentic RAG with Deep Reasoning: A Survey of RAG-Reasoning Systems in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.09477v2)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) lifts the factuality of Large Language Models (LLMs) by injecting external knowledge, yet it falls short on problems that demand multi-step inference; conversely, purely reasoning-oriented approaches often hallucinate or mis-ground facts. This survey synthesizes both strands under a unified reasoning-retrieval perspective. We first map how advanced reasoning optimizes each stage of RAG (Reasoning-Enhanced RAG). Then, we show how retrieved knowledge of different type supply missing premises and expand context for complex inference (RAG-Enhanced Reasoning). Finally, we spotlight emerging Synergized RAG-Reasoning frameworks, where (agentic) LLMs iteratively interleave search and reasoning to achieve state-of-the-art performance across knowledge-intensive benchmarks. We categorize methods, datasets, and open challenges, and outline research avenues toward deeper RAG-Reasoning systems that are more effective, multimodally-adaptive, trustworthy, and human-centric. The collection is available at https://github.com/DavidZWZ/Awesome-RAG-Reasoning.</p></details> | submitted to ARR May |
| **[MMed-RAG: Versatile Multimodal RAG System for Medical Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.13085v2)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) has demonstrated significant potential in healthcare, particularly in disease diagnosis and treatment planning. Recent progress in Medical Large Vision-Language Models (Med-LVLMs) has opened up new possibilities for interactive diagnostic tools. However, these models often suffer from factual hallucination, which can lead to incorrect diagnoses. Fine-tuning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) have emerged as methods to address these issues. However, the amount of high-quality data and distribution shifts between training data and deployment data limit the application of fine-tuning methods. Although RAG is lightweight and effective, existing RAG-based approaches are not sufficiently general to different medical domains and can potentially cause misalignment issues, both between modalities and between the model and the ground truth. In this paper, we propose a versatile multimodal RAG system, MMed-RAG, designed to enhance the factuality of Med-LVLMs. Our approach introduces a domain-aware retrieval mechanism, an adaptive retrieved contexts selection method, and a provable RAG-based preference fine-tuning strategy. These innovations make the RAG process sufficiently general and reliable, significantly improving alignment when introducing retrieved contexts. Experimental results across five medical datasets (involving radiology, ophthalmology, pathology) on medical VQA and report generation demonstrate that MMed-RAG can achieve an average improvement of 43.8% in the factual accuracy of Med-LVLMs. Our data and code are available in https://github.com/richard-peng-xia/MMed-RAG.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |
| **[KG-Infused RAG: Augmenting Corpus-Based RAG with External Knowledge Graphs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.09542v2)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) improves factual accuracy by grounding responses in external knowledge. However, existing RAG methods either rely solely on text corpora and neglect structural knowledge, or build ad-hoc knowledge graphs (KGs) at high cost and low reliability. To address these issues, we propose KG-Infused RAG, a framework that incorporates pre-existing large-scale KGs into RAG and applies spreading activation to enhance both retrieval and generation. KG-Infused RAG directly performs spreading activation over external KGs to retrieve relevant structured knowledge, which is then used to expand queries and integrated with corpus passages, enabling interpretable and semantically grounded multi-source retrieval. We further improve KG-Infused RAG through preference learning on sampled key stages of the pipeline. Experiments on five QA benchmarks show that KG-Infused RAG consistently outperforms vanilla RAG (by 3.9% to 17.8%). Compared with KG-based approaches such as GraphRAG and LightRAG, our method obtains structured knowledge at lower cost while achieving superior performance. Additionally, integrating KG-Infused RAG with Self-RAG and DeepNote yields further gains, demonstrating its effectiveness and versatility as a plug-and-play enhancement module for corpus-based RAG methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[FIT-RAG: Black-Box RAG with Factual Information and Token Reduction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.14374v1)** | 2024-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the extraordinarily large number of parameters, fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) to update long-tail or out-of-date knowledge is impractical in lots of applications. To avoid fine-tuning, we can alternatively treat a LLM as a black-box (i.e., freeze the parameters of the LLM) and augment it with a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system, namely black-box RAG. Recently, black-box RAG has achieved success in knowledge-intensive tasks and has gained much attention. Existing black-box RAG methods typically fine-tune the retriever to cater to LLMs' preferences and concatenate all the retrieved documents as the input, which suffers from two issues: (1) Ignorance of Factual Information. The LLM preferred documents may not contain the factual information for the given question, which can mislead the retriever and hurt the effectiveness of black-box RAG; (2) Waste of Tokens. Simply concatenating all the retrieved documents brings large amounts of unnecessary tokens for LLMs, which degenerates the efficiency of black-box RAG. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel black-box RAG framework which utilizes the factual information in the retrieval and reduces the number of tokens for augmentation, dubbed FIT-RAG. FIT-RAG utilizes the factual information by constructing a bi-label document scorer. Besides, it reduces the tokens by introducing a self-knowledge recognizer and a sub-document-level token reducer. FIT-RAG achieves both superior effectiveness and efficiency, which is validated by extensive experiments across three open-domain question-answering datasets: TriviaQA, NQ and PopQA. FIT-RAG can improve the answering accuracy of Llama2-13B-Chat by 14.3\% on TriviaQA, 19.9\% on NQ and 27.5\% on PopQA, respectively. Furthermore, it can save approximately half of the tokens on average across the three datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[FB-RAG: Improving RAG with Forward and Backward Lookup](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.17206v3)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) struggles with complex queries that lack strong signals to retrieve the most relevant context, forcing a trade-off between choosing a small context that misses key information and a large context that confuses the LLM. To address this, we propose Forward-Backward RAG (FB-RAG), a new training-free framework based on a simple yet powerful forward-looking strategy. FB-RAG employs a light-weight LLM to peek into potential future generations, using evidence from multiple sampled outputs to precisely identify the most relevant context for a final, more powerful generator. This improves performance without complex finetuning or Reinforcement Learning common in prior work. Across $9$ datasets from LongBench and $\infty$Bench, FB-RAG consistently delivers strong results. Further, the performance gains can be achieved with reduced latency due to a shorter, more focused prompt for the powerful generator. On EN.QA dataset, FB-RAG matches the leading baseline with over $48$% latency reduction or achieves an $8$% performance improvement with a $10$% latency reduction. Our analysis finds cases where even when the forward-looking LLM fails to generate correct answers, its attempts are sufficient to guide the final model to an accurate response, demonstrating how smaller LLMs can systematically improve the performance and efficiency of larger ones.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Findings of AACL 2025</p></details> |
| **[MedCoT-RAG: Causal Chain-of-Thought RAG for Medical Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.15849v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in medical question answering but often struggle with hallucinations and shallow reasoning, particularly in tasks requiring nuanced clinical understanding. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) offers a practical and privacy-preserving way to enhance LLMs with external medical knowledge. However, most existing approaches rely on surface-level semantic retrieval and lack the structured reasoning needed for clinical decision support. We introduce MedCoT-RAG, a domain-specific framework that combines causal-aware document retrieval with structured chain-of-thought prompting tailored to medical workflows. This design enables models to retrieve evidence aligned with diagnostic logic and generate step-by-step causal reasoning reflective of real-world clinical practice. Experiments on three diverse medical QA benchmarks show that MedCoT-RAG outperforms strong baselines by up to 10.3% over vanilla RAG and 6.4% over advanced domain-adapted methods, improving accuracy, interpretability, and consistency in complex medical tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[RAG-Pull: Imperceptible Attacks on RAG Systems for Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.11195v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) increases the reliability and trustworthiness of the LLM response and reduces hallucination by eliminating the need for model retraining. It does so by adding external data into the LLM's context. We develop a new class of black-box attack, RAG-Pull, that inserts hidden UTF characters into queries or external code repositories, redirecting retrieval toward malicious code, thereby breaking the models' safety alignment. We observe that query and code perturbations alone can shift retrieval toward attacker-controlled snippets, while combined query-and-target perturbations achieve near-perfect success. Once retrieved, these snippets introduce exploitable vulnerabilities such as remote code execution and SQL injection. RAG-Pull's minimal perturbations can alter the model's safety alignment and increase preference towards unsafe code, therefore opening up a new class of attacks on LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph RAG-Tool Fusion](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.07223v1)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent developments in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for selecting relevant tools from a tool knowledge base enable LLM agents to scale their complex tool calling capabilities to hundreds or thousands of external tools, APIs, or agents-as-tools. However, traditional RAG-based tool retrieval fails to capture structured dependencies between tools, limiting the retrieval accuracy of a retrieved tool's dependencies. For example, among a vector database of tools, a "get stock price" API requires a "stock ticker" parameter from a "get stock ticker" API, and both depend on OS-level internet connectivity tools. In this paper, we address this limitation by introducing Graph RAG-Tool Fusion, a novel plug-and-play approach that combines the strengths of vector-based retrieval with efficient graph traversal to capture all relevant tools (nodes) along with any nested dependencies (edges) within the predefined tool knowledge graph. We also present ToolLinkOS, a new tool selection benchmark of 573 fictional tools, spanning over 15 industries, each with an average of 6.3 tool dependencies. We demonstrate that Graph RAG-Tool Fusion achieves absolute improvements of 71.7% and 22.1% over naïve RAG on ToolLinkOS and ToolSandbox benchmarks, respectively (mAP@10).

Two separate systems form the RAG pipeline, the retriever and the reader, and the impact of each on downstream task performance is not well-understood. Here, we work towards the goal of understanding how retrievers can be optimized for RAG pipelines for common tasks such as Question Answering (QA). We conduct experiments focused on the relationship between retrieval and RAG performance on QA and attributed QA and unveil a number of insights useful to practitioners developing high-performance RAG pipelines. For example, lowering search accuracy has minor implications for RAG performance while potentially increasing retrieval speed and memory efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2024 Workshop ATTRIB</p></details> |
| **[Causal-Counterfactual RAG: The Integration of Causal-Counterfactual Reasoning into RAG](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.14435v2)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have transformed natural language processing (NLP), enabling diverse applications by integrating large-scale pre-trained knowledge. However, their static knowledge limits dynamic reasoning over external information, especially in knowledge-intensive domains. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this challenge by combining retrieval mechanisms with generative modeling to improve contextual understanding. Traditional RAG systems suffer from disrupted contextual integrity due to text chunking and over-reliance on semantic similarity for retrieval, often resulting in shallow and less accurate responses. We propose Causal-Counterfactual RAG, a novel framework that integrates explicit causal graphs representing cause-effect relationships into the retrieval process and incorporates counterfactual reasoning grounded on the causal structure. Unlike conventional methods, our framework evaluates not only direct causal evidence but also the counterfactuality of associated causes, combining results from both to generate more robust, accurate, and interpretable answers. By leveraging causal pathways and associated hypothetical scenarios, Causal-Counterfactual RAG preserves contextual coherence, reduces hallucination, and enhances reasoning fidelity.</p></details> |  |
| **[DMQR-RAG: Diverse Multi-Query Rewriting for RAG](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.13154v1)** | 2024-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models often encounter challenges with static knowledge and hallucinations, which undermine their reliability. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mitigates these issues by incorporating external information. However, user queries frequently contain noise and intent deviations, necessitating query rewriting to improve the relevance of retrieved documents. In this paper, we introduce DMQR-RAG, a Diverse Multi-Query Rewriting framework designed to improve the performance of both document retrieval and final responses in RAG. Specifically, we investigate how queries with varying information quantities can retrieve a diverse array of documents, presenting four rewriting strategies that operate at different levels of information to enhance the performance of baseline approaches. Additionally, we propose an adaptive strategy selection method that minimizes the number of rewrites while optimizing overall performance. Our methods have been rigorously validated through extensive experiments conducted in both academic and industry settings.</p></details> |  |

We propose AT-RAG, a novel multistep RAG incorporating topic modeling for efficient document retrieval and reasoning. Using BERTopic, our model dynamically assigns topics to queries, improving retrieval accuracy and efficiency. We evaluated AT-RAG on multihop benchmark datasets QA and a medical case study QA. Results show significant improvements in correctness, completeness, and relevance compared to existing methods. AT-RAG reduces retrieval time while maintaining high precision, making it suitable for general tasks QA and complex domain-specific challenges such as medical QA. The integration of topic filtering and iterative reasoning enables our model to handle intricate queries efficiently, which makes it suitable for applications that require nuanced information retrieval and decision-making.</p></details> |  |
| **[ER-RAG: Enhance RAG with ER-Based Unified Modeling of Heterogeneous Data Sources](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.06271v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) excel in question-answering (QA) tasks, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances their precision by incorporating external evidence from diverse sources like web pages, databases, and knowledge graphs. However, current RAG methods rely on agent-specific strategies for individual data sources, posing challenges low-resource or black-box environments and complicates operations when evidence is fragmented across sources. To address these limitations, we propose ER-RAG, a framework that unifies evidence integration across heterogeneous data sources using the Entity-Relationship (ER) model. ER-RAG standardizes entity retrieval and relationship querying through ER-based APIs with GET and JOIN operations. It employs a two-stage generation process: first, a preference optimization module selects optimal sources; second, another module constructs API chains based on source schemas. This unified approach allows efficient fine-tuning and seamless integration across diverse data sources. ER-RAG demonstrated its effectiveness by winning all three tracks of the 2024 KDDCup CRAG Challenge, achieving performance on par with commercial RAG pipelines using an 8B LLM backbone. It outperformed hybrid competitors by 3.1% in LLM score and accelerated retrieval by 5.5X.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing RAG Efficiency with Adaptive Context Compression](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.22931v3)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge but incurs significant inference costs due to lengthy retrieved contexts. While context compression mitigates this issue, existing methods apply fixed compression rates, over-compressing simple queries or under-compressing complex ones. We propose Adaptive Context Compression for RAG (ACC-RAG), a framework that dynamically adjusts compression rates based on input complexity, optimizing inference efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. ACC-RAG combines a hierarchical compressor (for multi-granular embeddings) with a context selector to retain minimal sufficient information, akin to human skimming. Evaluated on Wikipedia and five QA datasets, ACC-RAG outperforms fixed-rate methods and matches/unlocks over 4 times faster inference versus standard RAG while maintaining or improving accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[FG-RAG: Enhancing Query-Focused Summarization with Context-Aware Fine-Grained Graph RAG](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07103v1)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enables large language models to provide more precise and pertinent responses by incorporating external knowledge. In the Query-Focused Summarization (QFS) task, GraphRAG-based approaches have notably enhanced the comprehensiveness and diversity of generated responses. However, existing GraphRAG-based approaches predominantly focus on coarse-grained information summarization without being aware of the specific query, and the retrieved content lacks sufficient contextual information to generate comprehensive responses. To address the deficiencies of current RAG systems, we propose Context-Aware Fine-Grained Graph RAG (FG-RAG) to enhance the performance of the QFS task. FG-RAG employs Context-Aware Entity Expansion in graph retrieval to expand the coverage of retrieved entities in the graph, thus providing enough contextual information for the retrieved content. Furthermore, FG-RAG utilizes Query-Level Fine-Grained Summarization to incorporate fine-grained details during response generation, enhancing query awareness for the generated summarization. Our evaluation demonstrates that FG-RAG outperforms other RAG systems in multiple metrics of comprehensiveness, diversity, and empowerment when handling the QFS task. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/BuptWululu/FG-RAG.</p></details> |  |
| **[Each to Their Own: Exploring the Optimal Embedding in RAG](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.17442v2)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, as Large Language Models (LLMs) have fundamentally impacted various fields, the methods for incorporating up-to-date information into LLMs or adding external knowledge to construct domain-specific models have garnered wide attention. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), serving as an inference-time scaling method, is notable for its low cost and minimal effort for parameter tuning. However, due to heterogeneous training data and model architecture, the variant embedding models used in RAG exhibit different benefits across various areas, often leading to different similarity calculation results and, consequently, varying response quality from LLMs. To address this problem, we propose and examine two approaches to enhance RAG by combining the benefits of multiple embedding models, named Mixture-Embedding RAG and Confident RAG. Mixture-Embedding RAG simply sorts and selects retrievals from multiple embedding models based on standardized similarity; however, it does not outperform vanilla RAG. In contrast, Confident RAG generates responses multiple times using different embedding models and then selects the responses with the highest confidence level, demonstrating average improvements of approximately 10% and 5% over vanilla LLMs and RAG, respectively. The consistent results across different LLMs and embedding models indicate that Confident RAG is an efficient plug-and-play approach for various domains. We will release our code upon publication.</p></details> |  |

To answer this question, we investigate the efficacy of crowdsourcing for RAG through two complementary studies: response writing and response utility judgment. We present the Crowd RAG Corpus 2025 (CrowdRAG-25), which consists of 903 human-written and 903 LLM-generated responses for the 301 topics of the TREC RAG'24 track, across the three discourse styles 'bulleted list', 'essay', and 'news'. For a selection of 65 topics, the corpus further contains 47,320 pairwise human judgments and 10,556 pairwise LLM judgments across seven utility dimensions (e.g., coverage and coherence). Our analyses give insights into human writing behavior for RAG and the viability of crowdsourcing for RAG evaluation. Human pairwise judgments provide reliable and cost-effective results compared to LLM-based pairwise or human/LLM-based pointwise judgments, as well as automated comparisons with human-written reference responses. All our data and tools are freely available.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 9 tables, 5 figures. Accepted at SIGIR'25</p></details> |
| **[KET-RAG: A Cost-Efficient Multi-Granular Indexing Framework for Graph-RAG](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.09304v2)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph-RAG constructs a knowledge graph from text chunks to improve retrieval in Large Language Model (LLM)-based question answering. It is particularly useful in domains such as biomedicine, law, and political science, where retrieval often requires multi-hop reasoning over proprietary documents. Some existing Graph-RAG systems construct KNN graphs based on text chunk relevance, but this coarse-grained approach fails to capture entity relationships within texts, leading to sub-par retrieval and generation quality. To address this, recent solutions leverage LLMs to extract entities and relationships from text chunks, constructing triplet-based knowledge graphs. However, this approach incurs significant indexing costs, especially for large document collections. To ensure a good result accuracy while reducing the indexing cost, we propose KET-RAG, a multi-granular indexing framework. KET-RAG first identifies a small set of key text chunks and leverages an LLM to construct a knowledge graph skeleton. It then builds a text-keyword bipartite graph from all text chunks, serving as a lightweight alternative to a full knowledge graph. During retrieval, KET-RAG searches both structures: it follows the local search strategy of existing Graph-RAG systems on the skeleton while mimicking this search on the bipartite graph to improve retrieval quality. We evaluate 13 solutions on three real-world datasets, demonstrating that KET-RAG outperforms all competitors in indexing cost, retrieval effectiveness, and generation quality. Notably, it achieves comparable or superior retrieval quality to Microsoft's Graph-RAG while reducing indexing costs by over an order of magnitude. Additionally, it improves the generation quality by up to 32.4% while lowering indexing costs by around 20%.</p></details> |  |

However, RAG accuracy becomes increasingly challenging as the corpus of documents scales up, with Retrievers playing an outsized role in the overall RAG accuracy by extracting the most relevant document from the corpus to provide context to the LLM. In this paper, we propose the 'Blended RAG' method of leveraging semantic search techniques, such as Dense Vector indexes and Sparse Encoder indexes, blended with hybrid query strategies. Our study achieves better retrieval results and sets new benchmarks for IR (Information Retrieval) datasets like NQ and TREC-COVID datasets. We further extend such a 'Blended Retriever' to the RAG system to demonstrate far superior results on Generative Q\&A datasets like SQUAD, even surpassing fine-tuning performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted by MIPR and presented at The 7th IEEE International Conference on Multimedia Information.

To improve factual reliability, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) integrates external knowledge during inference. However, existing RAG systems face two major limitations: (1) unreliable adaptive control due to limited external knowledge supervision, and (2) hallucinations caused by inaccurate or irrelevant references. To address these issues, we propose Know3-RAG, a knowledge-aware RAG framework that leverages structured knowledge from knowledge graphs (KGs) to guide three core stages of the RAG process, including retrieval, generation, and filtering. Specifically, we introduce a knowledge-aware adaptive retrieval module that employs KG embedding to assess the confidence of the generated answer and determine retrieval necessity, a knowledge-enhanced reference generation strategy that enriches queries with KG-derived entities to improve generated reference relevance, and a knowledge-driven reference filtering mechanism that ensures semantic alignment and factual accuracy of references. Experiments on multiple open-domain QA benchmarks demonstrate that Know3-RAG consistently outperforms strong baselines, significantly reducing hallucinations and enhancing answer reliability.</p></details> |  |

However, current RAG methods face two limitations: (1) they only cover limited RAG scenarios. (2) They suffer from limited task diversity due to the lack of a general RAG dataset. To address these limitations, we propose RAG-Instruct, a general method for synthesizing diverse and high-quality RAG instruction data based on any source corpus. Our approach leverages (1) five RAG paradigms, which encompass diverse query-document relationships, and (2) instruction simulation, which enhances instruction diversity and quality by utilizing the strengths of existing instruction datasets. Using this method, we construct a 40K instruction dataset from Wikipedia, comprehensively covering diverse RAG scenarios and tasks. Experiments demonstrate that RAG-Instruct effectively enhances LLMs' RAG capabilities, achieving strong zero-shot performance and significantly outperforming various RAG baselines across a diverse set of tasks. RAG-Instruct is publicly available at https://github.com/FreedomIntelligence/RAG-Instruct.</p></details> |  |

However, implementing RAG in enterprises poses challenges around data security, accuracy, scalability, and integration. This paper explores the unique requirements for enterprise RAG, surveys current approaches and limitations, and discusses potential advances in semantic search, hybrid queries, and optimized retrieval. It proposes an evaluation framework to validate enterprise RAG solutions, including quantitative testing, qualitative analysis, ablation studies, and industry case studies. This framework aims to help demonstrate the ability of purpose-built RAG architectures to deliver accuracy and relevance improvements with enterprise-grade security, compliance and integration.

Accurate and efficient scenario data search is critical for both online vehicle decision-making and planning, and offline scenario generation and simulations, as it allows for leveraging the scenario experiences to improve the overall performance. Especially with the application of large language models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented-Generation (RAG) systems in autonomous driving, urgent requirements are put forward. In this paper, we introduce the Driving-RAG framework to address the challenges of efficient scenario data embedding, search, and applications for RAG systems. Our embedding model aligns fundamental scenario information and scenario distance metrics in the vector space. The typical scenario sampling method combined with hierarchical navigable small world can perform efficient scenario vector search to achieve high efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. In addition, the reorganization mechanism by graph knowledge enhances the relevance to the prompt scenarios and augment LLM generation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework on typical trajectory planning task for complex interactive scenarios such as ramps and intersections, showcasing its advantages for RAG applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[METIS: Fast Quality-Aware RAG Systems with Configuration Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.10543v3)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) allows LLMs (large language models) to generate better responses with external knowledge, but using more external knowledge often improves generation quality at the expense of response delay. Prior work either reduces the response delay (through better scheduling of RAG queries) or strives to maximize quality (which involves tuning the RAG workflow), but they fall short in optimizing the tradeoff between the delay and quality of RAG responses. This paper presents METIS, the first RAG system that jointly schedules queries and adapts the key RAG configurations of each query, such as the number of retrieved text chunks and synthesis methods, in order to balance quality optimization and response delay reduction. Using 4 popular RAG-QA datasets, we show that compared with the state-of-the-art RAG optimization schemes, METIS reduces the generation latency by $1.64-2.54\times$ without sacrificing generation quality.</p></details> | 17 pages, 18 figures |

To contribute to this, we implemented a Conversational AI system that enables staff in an airport to communicate with flight information systems. This system not only answers standard airport queries but also resolves airport terminology, jargon, abbreviations, and dynamic questions involving reasoning. In this paper, we built three different Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods, including traditional RAG, SQL RAG, and Knowledge Graph-based RAG (Graph RAG). Experiments showed that traditional RAG achieved 84.84% accuracy using BM25 + GPT-4 but occasionally produced hallucinations, which is risky to airport safety. In contrast, SQL RAG and Graph RAG achieved 80.85% and 91.49% accuracy respectively, with significantly fewer hallucinations. Moreover, Graph RAG was especially effective for questions that involved reasoning. Based on our observations, we thus recommend SQL RAG and Graph RAG are better for airport environments, due to fewer hallucinations and the ability to handle dynamic questions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NAACL 2025 industry track</p></details> |

However, current datasets and methods are highly focused on cases where only a small part of the corpus (usually a few paragraphs) is relevant per query, and fail to capture the rich world of aggregative queries. These require gathering information from a large set of documents and reasoning over them. To address this gap, we propose S-RAG, an approach specifically designed for such queries. At ingestion time, S-RAG constructs a structured representation of the corpus; at inference time, it translates natural-language queries into formal queries over said representation. To validate our approach and promote further research in this area, we introduce two new datasets of aggregative queries: HOTELS and WORLD CUP. Experiments with S-RAG on the newly introduced datasets, as well as on a public benchmark, demonstrate that it substantially outperforms both common RAG systems and long-context LLMs.</p></details> |  |

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a promising solution for addressing the limitations of LLMs, yet existing studies on the robustness of RAG often overlook the interconnected relationships between RAG components or the potential threats prevalent in real-world databases, such as minor textual errors. In this work, we investigate two underexplored aspects when assessing the robustness of RAG: 1) vulnerability to noisy documents through low-level perturbations and 2) a holistic evaluation of RAG robustness. Furthermore, we introduce a novel attack method, the Genetic Attack on RAG (\textit{GARAG}), which targets these aspects. Specifically, GARAG is designed to reveal vulnerabilities within each component and test the overall system functionality against noisy documents. We validate RAG robustness by applying our \textit{GARAG} to standard QA datasets, incorporating diverse retrievers and LLMs. The experimental results show that GARAG consistently achieves high attack success rates. Also, it significantly devastates the performance of each component and their synergy, highlighting the substantial risk that minor textual inaccuracies pose in disrupting RAG systems in the real world.</p></details> | <details><summary>Findi...</summary><p>Findings of EMNLP Camera-ready version</p></details> |

We introduce a new method called Multi-Meta-RAG, which uses database filtering with LLM-extracted metadata to improve the RAG selection of the relevant documents from various sources, relevant to the question. While database filtering is specific to a set of questions from a particular domain and format, we found out that Multi-Meta-RAG greatly improves the results on the MultiHop-RAG benchmark.

Despite impressive advancements, vanilla RAG-based VQA methods that rely on unstructured documents and overlook the structural relationships among knowledge elements frequently introduce irrelevant or misleading content, reducing answer accuracy and reliability. To overcome these challenges, a promising solution is to integrate multimodal knowledge graphs (KGs) into RAG-based VQA frameworks to enhance the generation by introducing structured multimodal knowledge. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel multimodal knowledge-augmented generation framework (mKG-RAG) based on multimodal KGs for knowledge-intensive VQA tasks. Specifically, our approach leverages MLLM-powered keyword extraction and vision-text matching to distill semantically consistent and modality-aligned entities/relationships from multimodal documents, constructing high-quality multimodal KGs as structured knowledge representations. In addition, a dual-stage retrieval strategy equipped with a question-aware multimodal retriever is introduced to improve retrieval efficiency while refining precision. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods, setting a new state-of-the-art for knowledge-based VQA.</p></details> |  |

The challenge of detecting such unauthorized usage remains underexplored, with datasets and methods from adjacent fields being ill-suited for its study. We take several steps to bridge this gap. First, we formalize this problem as (black-box) RAG Dataset Inference (RAG-DI). We then introduce a novel dataset designed for realistic benchmarking of RAG-DI methods, alongside a set of baselines. Finally, we propose Ward, a method for RAG-DI based on LLM watermarks that equips data owners with rigorous statistical guarantees regarding their dataset's misuse in RAG corpora. Ward consistently outperforms all baselines, achieving higher accuracy, superior query efficiency and robustness. Our work provides a foundation for future studies of RAG-DI and highlights LLM watermarks as a promising approach to this problem.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

To overcome these limitations, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) incorporates up-to-date external information into LLMs without extensive fine-tuning. Meanwhile, small language models (SLMs) deployed on edge devices offer efficiency and low latency but often struggle with complex reasoning tasks. Unfortunately, current RAG approaches are predominantly based on centralized databases and have not been adapted to address the distinct constraints associated with deploying SLMs in edge environments. To bridge this gap, we propose Edge-Assisted and Collaborative RAG (EACO-RAG), a lightweight framework that leverages distributed edge nodes for adaptive knowledge updates and retrieval. EACO-RAG also employs a hierarchical collaborative gating mechanism to dynamically select among local, edge-assisted, and cloud-based strategies, with a carefully designed algorithm based on Safe Online Bayesian Optimization to maximize the potential performance enhancements. Experimental results demonstrate that EACO-RAG matches the accuracy of cloud-based knowledge graph RAG systems while reducing total costs by up to 84.6% under relaxed delay constraints and by 65.3% under stricter delay requirements. This work represents our initial effort toward achieving a distributed and scalable tiered LLM deployments, with EACO-RAG serving as a promising first step in unlocking the full potential of hybrid edge-cloud intelligence.</p></details> |  |

However, conventional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods encode content in isolated chunks during ingestion, losing structural and cross-page dependencies, and retrieve a fixed number of pages at inference, regardless of the specific demands of the question or context. This often results in incomplete evidence retrieval and degraded answer quality for multi-page reasoning tasks. To address these limitations, we propose LAD-RAG, a novel Layout-Aware Dynamic RAG framework. During ingestion, LAD-RAG constructs a symbolic document graph that captures layout structure and cross-page dependencies, adding it alongside standard neural embeddings to yield a more holistic representation of the document. During inference, an LLM agent dynamically interacts with the neural and symbolic indices to adaptively retrieve the necessary evidence based on the query. Experiments on MMLongBench-Doc, LongDocURL, DUDE, and MP-DocVQA demonstrate that LAD-RAG improves retrieval, achieving over 90% perfect recall on average without any top-k tuning, and outperforming baseline retrievers by up to 20% in recall at comparable noise levels, yielding higher QA accuracy with minimal latency.</p></details> |  |

Evaluating these applications and RAG pipelines is mostly done manually, via a trial and error process. Automating evaluation of RAG pipelines requires overcoming challenges such as context misunderstanding, wrong format, incorrect specificity, and missing content. Prior works therefore focused on improving evaluation metrics as well as enhancing components within the pipeline using available question and answer datasets. However, they have not focused on 1) providing a schema for capturing different types of question-answer pairs or 2) creating a set of templates for generating question-answer pairs that can support automation of RAG pipeline evaluation. In this paper, we present a technique for generating variations in question-answer pairs to trigger failures in RAG pipelines. We validate 5 open-source RAG pipelines using 3 datasets. Our approach revealed the highest failure rates when prompts combine multiple questions: 91% for questions when spanning multiple documents and 78% for questions from a single document; indicating a need for developers to prioritise handling these combined questions. 60% failure rate was observed in academic domain dataset and 53% and 62% failure rates were observed in open-domain datasets. Our automated approach outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods, by increasing the failure rate by 51% on average per dataset. Our work presents an automated approach for continuously monitoring the health of RAG pipelines, which can be integrated into existing CI/CD pipelines, allowing for improved quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 5 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |

However, we find that existing RAG systems are inadequate in answering multi-hop queries, which require retrieving and reasoning over multiple pieces of supporting evidence. Furthermore, to our knowledge, no existing RAG benchmarking dataset focuses on multi-hop queries. In this paper, we develop a novel dataset, MultiHop-RAG, which consists of a knowledge base, a large collection of multi-hop queries, their ground-truth answers, and the associated supporting evidence. We detail the procedure of building the dataset, utilizing an English news article dataset as the underlying RAG knowledge base. We demonstrate the benchmarking utility of MultiHop-RAG in two experiments. The first experiment compares different embedding models for retrieving evidence for multi-hop queries. In the second experiment, we examine the capabilities of various state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-4, PaLM, and Llama2-70B, in reasoning and answering multi-hop queries given the evidence. Both experiments reveal that existing RAG methods perform unsatisfactorily in retrieving and answering multi-hop queries. We hope MultiHop-RAG will be a valuable resource for the community in developing effective RAG systems, thereby facilitating greater adoption of LLMs in practice.

By synergizing retrieval mechanisms with advanced reasoning, LLMs can now tackle increasingly complex problems. This paper presents a systematic review of the collaborative interplay between RAG and reasoning, clearly defining "reasoning" within the RAG context. It construct a comprehensive taxonomy encompassing multi-dimensional collaborative objectives, representative paradigms, and technical implementations, and analyze the bidirectional synergy methods. Additionally, we critically evaluate current limitations in RAG assessment, including the absence of intermediate supervision for multi-step reasoning and practical challenges related to cost-risk trade-offs. To bridge theory and practice, we provide practical guidelines tailored to diverse real-world applications. Finally, we identify promising research directions, such as graph-based knowledge integration, hybrid model collaboration, and RL-driven optimization. Overall, this work presents a theoretical framework and practical foundation to advance RAG systems in academia and industry, fostering the next generation of RAG solutions.</p></details> |  |

Recent research has increasingly concentrated on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) frameworks and their evolution into more advanced agent-based architectures within personalized settings to enhance user satisfaction. Building on this foundation, this survey systematically examines personalization across the three core stages of RAG: pre-retrieval, retrieval, and generation. Beyond RAG, we further extend its capabilities into the realm of Personalized LLM-based Agents, which enhance traditional RAG systems with agentic functionalities, including user understanding, personalized planning and execution, and dynamic generation. For both personalization in RAG and agent-based personalization, we provide formal definitions, conduct a comprehensive review of recent literature, and summarize key datasets and evaluation metrics. Additionally, we discuss fundamental challenges, limitations, and promising research directions in this evolving field.

While many tools exist empowering developers to build their own systems, measuring their performance locally, with datasets reflective of the system's use cases, is a technological challenge. Solutions to this problem range from non-specific and cheap (most public datasets) to specific and costly (generating data from local documents). In this paper, we show that using public question and answer (Q&A) datasets to assess retrieval performance can lead to non-optimal systems design, and that common tools for RAG dataset generation can lead to unbalanced data. We propose solutions to these issues based on the characterization of RAG datasets through labels and through label-targeted data generation. Finally, we show that fine-tuned small LLMs can efficiently generate Q&A datasets. We believe that these observations are invaluable to the know-your-data step of RAG systems development.</p></details> | <details><summary>to be...</summary><p>to be published in the 31st International Conference on Computational Linguistics (COLING 2025)</p></details> |

This problem is traditionally addressed with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) chatbots, but in this study, I evaluated the use of the newly popularized RAG-Fusion method. RAG-Fusion combines RAG and reciprocal rank fusion (RRF) by generating multiple queries, reranking them with reciprocal scores and fusing the documents and scores. Through manually evaluating answers on accuracy, relevance, and comprehensiveness, I found that RAG-Fusion was able to provide accurate and comprehensive answers due to the generated queries contextualizing the original query from various perspectives. However, some answers strayed off topic when the generated queries' relevance to the original query is insufficient. This research marks significant progress in artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP) applications and demonstrates transformations in a global and multi-industry context.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 2 figures, 8 pages</p></details> |

Existing RAG datasets, however, do not adequately represent the diverse and dynamic nature of real-world Question Answering (QA) tasks. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Comprehensive RAG Benchmark (CRAG), a factual question answering benchmark of 4,409 question-answer pairs and mock APIs to simulate web and Knowledge Graph (KG) search. CRAG is designed to encapsulate a diverse array of questions across five domains and eight question categories, reflecting varied entity popularity from popular to long-tail, and temporal dynamisms ranging from years to seconds. Our evaluation of this benchmark highlights the gap to fully trustworthy QA. Whereas most advanced LLMs achieve <=34% accuracy on CRAG, adding RAG in a straightforward manner improves the accuracy only to 44%. State-of-the-art industry RAG solutions only answer 63% of questions without any hallucination. CRAG also reveals much lower accuracy in answering questions regarding facts with higher dynamism, lower popularity, or higher complexity, suggesting future research directions. The CRAG benchmark laid the groundwork for a KDD Cup 2024 challenge and attracted thousands of participants and submissions. We commit to maintaining CRAG to serve research communities in advancing RAG solutions and general QA solutions.

However, the introduction of external knowledge bases presents RAG with challenges in long-context processing, significantly increasing memory consumption and inference latency. Existing research accelerates inference by precomputing Key and Value (KV) of the knowledge base and loading them on-demand during inference. Based on the access frequency of different KV chunks within the external knowledge base, this paper proposes a hotness-aware RAG (HA-RAG) inference optimization system. First, leveraging the numerical distribution of KV chunks, we introduce a hotness-aware mixed-precision compressing and loading method to reduce disk I/O and memory access overhead. Second, we design a hotness-aware data placement strategy that prioritizes storing frequently accessed KV chunks in high-speed memory to improve data access efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared with TurboRAG, the proposed HA-RAG achieves an average speedup of 2.10x and maximum speedup of 10.49x in Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) with negligible accuracy loss.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages,16 figures,2 tables</p></details> |
| **[How Much Can RAG Help the Reasoning of LLM?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.02338v2)** | 2024-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has gained significant popularity in modern Large Language Models (LLMs) due to its effectiveness in introducing new knowledge and reducing hallucinations. However, the deep understanding of RAG remains limited, how does RAG help the reasoning process and can RAG help improve the reasoning capability remains question. While external documents are typically considered as a method to incorporate domain-specific information, they also contain intermediate reasoning results related to the query, this suggests that documents could enhance the reasoning capability of LLMs, which has not been previously explored. In this paper, we investigate this issue in depth and find that while RAG can assist with reasoning, the help is limited. If we conceptualize the reasoning process as a tree with fixed depth, then RAG struggles to assist LLMs in performing deeper reasoning. Additionally, the information in the documents requires preprocessing to filter out noise. We demonstrate that this preprocessing is difficult to achieve simply fine-tuning of the LLM, it often necessitates numerous additional transformer layers to solve the problem. To simplify the problem, we propose DPrompt tuning, which effectively resolves the issue within just limited transformer layers, leading to improved performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[EnronQA: Towards Personalized RAG over Private Documents](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.00263v1)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has become one of the most popular methods for bringing knowledge-intensive context to large language models (LLM) because of its ability to bring local context at inference time without the cost or data leakage risks associated with fine-tuning. A clear separation of private information from the LLM training has made RAG the basis for many enterprise LLM workloads as it allows the company to augment LLM's understanding using customers' private documents. Despite its popularity for private documents in enterprise deployments, current RAG benchmarks for validating and optimizing RAG pipelines draw their corpora from public data such as Wikipedia or generic web pages and offer little to no personal context. Seeking to empower more personal and private RAG we release the EnronQA benchmark, a dataset of 103,638 emails with 528,304 question-answer pairs across 150 different user inboxes. EnronQA enables better benchmarking of RAG pipelines over private data and allows for experimentation on the introduction of personalized retrieval settings over realistic data. Finally, we use EnronQA to explore the tradeoff in memorization and retrieval when reasoning over private documents.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 4 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

To address this, we introduce PIR-RAG, a practical system for privacy-preserving RAG. PIR-RAG employs a novel architecture that uses coarse-grained semantic clustering to prune the search space, combined with a fast, lattice-based Private Information Retrieval (PIR) protocol. This design allows for the efficient retrieval of entire document clusters, uniquely optimizing for the end-to-end RAG workflow where full document content is required. Our comprehensive evaluation against strong baseline architectures, including graph-based PIR and Tiptoe-style private scoring, demonstrates PIR-RAG's scalability and its superior performance in terms of "RAG-Ready Latency"-the true end-to-end time required to securely fetch content for an LLM. Our work establishes PIR-RAG as a viable and highly efficient solution for privacy in large-scale AI systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[LegalBench-RAG: A Benchmark for Retrieval-Augmented Generation in the Legal Domain](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.10343v1)** | 2024-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems are showing promising potential, and are becoming increasingly relevant in AI-powered legal applications. Existing benchmarks, such as LegalBench, assess the generative capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the legal domain, but there is a critical gap in evaluating the retrieval component of RAG systems. To address this, we introduce LegalBench-RAG, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the retrieval step of RAG pipelines within the legal space. LegalBench-RAG emphasizes precise retrieval by focusing on extracting minimal, highly relevant text segments from legal documents. These highly relevant snippets are preferred over retrieving document IDs, or large sequences of imprecise chunks, both of which can exceed context window limitations. Long context windows cost more to process, induce higher latency, and lead LLMs to forget or hallucinate information. Additionally, precise results allow LLMs to generate citations for the end user. The LegalBench-RAG benchmark is constructed by retracing the context used in LegalBench queries back to their original locations within the legal corpus, resulting in a dataset of 6,858 query-answer pairs over a corpus of over 79M characters, entirely human-annotated by legal experts. We also introduce LegalBench-RAG-mini, a lightweight version for rapid iteration and experimentation. By providing a dedicated benchmark for legal retrieval, LegalBench-RAG serves as a critical tool for companies and researchers focused on enhancing the accuracy and performance of RAG systems in the legal domain. The LegalBench-RAG dataset is publicly available at https://github.com/zeroentropy-cc/legalbenchrag.</p></details> |  |
| **[In Defense of RAG in the Era of Long-Context Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.01666v1)** | 2024-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Overcoming the limited context limitations in early-generation LLMs, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has been a reliable solution for context-based answer generation in the past. Recently, the emergence of long-context LLMs allows the models to incorporate much longer text sequences, making RAG less attractive. Recent studies show that long-context LLMs significantly outperform RAG in long-context applications. Unlike the existing works favoring the long-context LLM over RAG, we argue that the extremely long context in LLMs suffers from a diminished focus on relevant information and leads to potential degradation in answer quality. This paper revisits the RAG in long-context answer generation. We propose an order-preserve retrieval-augmented generation (OP-RAG) mechanism, which significantly improves the performance of RAG for long-context question-answer applications. With OP-RAG, as the number of retrieved chunks increases, the answer quality initially rises, and then declines, forming an inverted U-shaped curve. There exist sweet points where OP-RAG could achieve higher answer quality with much less tokens than long-context LLM taking the whole context as input. Extensive experiments on public benchmark demonstrate the superiority of our OP-RAG.</p></details> |  |
| **[Long Context RAG Performance of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.03538v1)** | 2024-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a crucial technique for enhancing the accuracy of Large Language Models (LLMs) by incorporating external information. With the advent of LLMs that support increasingly longer context lengths, there is a growing interest in understanding how these models perform in RAG scenarios. Can these new long context models improve RAG performance? This paper presents a comprehensive study of the impact of increased context length on RAG performance across 20 popular open source and commercial LLMs. We ran RAG workflows while varying the total context length from 2,000 to 128,000 tokens (and 2 million tokens when possible) on three domain-specific datasets, and report key insights on the benefits and limitations of long context in RAG applications. Our findings reveal that while retrieving more documents can improve performance, only a handful of the most recent state of the art LLMs can maintain consistent accuracy at long context above 64k tokens. We also identify distinct failure modes in long context scenarios, suggesting areas for future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>2024 ...</summary><p>2024 NeurIPS workshop on Adaptive Foundation Models: Evolving AI for Personalized and Efficient Learning</p></details> |

However, processing long-context inputs introduces significant system latency and demands substantial memory for the key-value cache, resulting in reduced throughput and a fundamental trade-off between knowledge enrichment and system efficiency. While minimizing latency for long-context inputs is a primary objective for LLMs, we contend that RAG require specialized consideration. In RAG, much of the LLM context consists of concatenated passages from retrieval, with only a small subset directly relevant to the query. These passages often exhibit low semantic similarity due to diversity or deduplication during re-ranking, leading to block-diagonal attention patterns that differ from those in standard LLM generation tasks. Based on this observation, we argue that most computations over the RAG context during decoding are unnecessary and can be eliminated with minimal impact on performance. To this end, we propose REFRAG, an efficient decoding framework that compresses, senses, and expands to improve latency in RAG applications. By exploiting the sparsity structure, we demonstrate a 30.85 the time-to-first-token acceleration (3.75 improvement to previous work) without loss in perplexity. In addition, our optimization framework for large context enables REFRAG to extend the context size of LLMs by 16. We provide rigorous validation of REFRAG across diverse long-context tasks, including RAG, multi-turn conversations, and long document summarization, spanning a wide range of datasets. Experimental results confirm that REFRAG delivers substantial speedup with no loss in accuracy compared to LLaMA models and other state-of-the-art baselines across various context sizes.</p></details> | <details><summary>fix t...</summary><p>fix typo perplexity->log perplexity; added recent papers</p></details> |

An important application area is question answering over private enterprise documents where the main considerations are data security, which necessitates applications that can be deployed on-prem, limited computational resources and the need for a robust application that correctly responds to queries. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as the most prominent framework for building LLM-based applications. While building a RAG is relatively straightforward, making it robust and a reliable application requires extensive customization and relatively deep knowledge of the application domain. We share our experiences building and deploying an LLM application for question answering over private organizational documents. Our application combines the use of RAG with a finetuned open-source LLM. Additionally, our system, which we call Tree-RAG (T-RAG), uses a tree structure to represent entity hierarchies within the organization. This is used to generate a textual description to augment the context when responding to user queries pertaining to entities within the organization's hierarchy. Our evaluations, including a Needle in a Haystack test, show that this combination performs better than a simple RAG or finetuning implementation. Finally, we share some lessons learned based on our experiences building an LLM application for real-world use.</p></details> | <details><summary>Added...</summary><p>Added Needle in a Haystack analysis for T-RAG</p></details> |

Although there exist multiple RAG benchmarks for English, evaluation resources for other languages, including Russian, remain scarce and static, failing to capture the dynamic nature of real-world deployments. In this work, we present DRAGON (Dynamic RAG Benchmark On News), the first dynamic benchmark for evaluating RAG systems in Russian on a changing news corpora. DRAGON is built upon a regularly updated corpus of Russian news and public documents and supports comprehensive evaluation of both the retriever and generator components. Question generation is performed automatically with the use of Knowledge Graph constructed from the corpus and enables the extraction of four core question types aligned with distinct subgraph patterns. We release a complete evaluation framework comprising the pipeline for automatic question generation, evaluation scripts, which are potentially reusable for other languages and multilingual settings, and benchmark data.

Despite RAG's success in improving agent performance, agent-level cache management, particularly constructing, maintaining, and updating a compact, relevant corpus dynamically tailored to each agent's need, remains underexplored. Therefore, we introduce ARC (Agent RAG Cache Mechanism), a novel, annotation-free caching framework that dynamically manages small, high-value corpora for each agent. By synthesizing historical query distribution patterns with the intrinsic geometry of cached items in the embedding space, ARC automatically maintains a high-relevance cache. With comprehensive experiments on three retrieval datasets, our experimental results demonstrate that ARC reduces storage requirements to 0.015% of the original corpus while offering up to 79.8% has-answer rate and reducing average retrieval latency by 80%. Our results demonstrate that ARC can drastically enhance efficiency and effectiveness in RAG-powered LLM agents.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents the integration of Super RAGs into the Mistral 8x7B v1, a state-of-the-art LLM, and examines the resultant improvements in accuracy, speed, and user satisfaction. Our methodology uses a fine-tuned instruct model setup and a cache tuning fork system, ensuring efficient and relevant data retrieval. The evaluation, conducted over several epochs, demonstrates significant enhancements across all metrics. The findings suggest that Super RAGs can effectively augment LLMs, paving the way for more sophisticated and reliable AI systems.

While the literature on RAG is growing, it primarily focuses on systematic reviews and comparisons of new state-of-the-art (SoTA) techniques against their predecessors, with a gap in extensive experimental comparisons. This study begins to address this gap by assessing various RAG methods' impacts on retrieval precision and answer similarity. We found that Hypothetical Document Embedding (HyDE) and LLM reranking significantly enhance retrieval precision. However, Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) and Cohere rerank did not exhibit notable advantages over a baseline Naive RAG system, and Multi-query approaches underperformed. Sentence Window Retrieval emerged as the most effective for retrieval precision, despite its variable performance on answer similarity. The study confirms the potential of the Document Summary Index as a competent retrieval approach. All resources related to this research are publicly accessible for further investigation through our GitHub repository ARAGOG (https://github.com/predlico/ARAGOG).

This issue becomes particularly evident due to the sensitivity of large language models (LLMs) to the ordering of few-shot prompts, which can affect model performance. To address this challenge, aligning LLM outputs with human preferences using structured feedback, such as options to copy, regenerate, or dislike, offers a promising method for improvement. This feedback is applied to the entire list of inputs rather than giving specific ratings for individual documents, making it a Listwide Labels Learning-to-Rank task. To address this task, we propose Pistis-RAG, a new RAG framework designed with a content-centric approach to better align LLMs with human preferences. Pistis-RAG effectively utilizes human feedback, enhancing content ranking and generation quality. To validate our framework, we use public datasets to simulate human feedback, allowing us to evaluate and refine our method effectively. Experimental results indicate that Pistis-RAG improves alignment with human preferences relative to the baseline RAG system, showing a 6.06% increase in MMLU (English) and a 7.08% increase in C-EVAL (Chinese) accuracy metrics. These results highlight Pistis-RAG's effectiveness in overcoming the limitations associated with traditional RAG approaches.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we propose Debate-Augmented RAG (DRAG), a training-free framework that integrates Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) mechanisms into both retrieval and generation stages. In retrieval, DRAG employs structured debates among proponents, opponents, and judges to refine retrieval quality and ensure factual reliability. In generation, DRAG introduces asymmetric information roles and adversarial debates, enhancing reasoning robustness and mitigating factual inconsistencies. Evaluations across multiple tasks demonstrate that DRAG improves retrieval reliability, reduces RAG-induced hallucinations, and significantly enhances overall factual accuracy.

However, existing approaches underutilize the inherent knowledge of large language models (LLMs), leading to suboptimal retrieval decisions and degraded generation performance. To bridge this gap, we propose Self-Routing RAG (SR-RAG), a novel framework that binds selective retrieval with knowledge verbalization. SR-RAG enables an LLM to dynamically decide whether to retrieve external knowledge or verbalize its own parametric knowledge. To this end, we design a multi-task objective that jointly optimizes an LLM for knowledge source selection, knowledge verbalization, and response generation. SR-RAG further incorporates a nearest neighbor search mechanism at inference time to improve the accuracy of knowledge source decisions under domain shifts. Fine-tuning three LLMs with SR-RAG significantly improves both their response accuracy and reduces the inference latency. Compared to the strongest selective retrieval baseline, SR-RAG reduces the number of retrievals by 29% while improving performance by 5.1%.</p></details> |  |

The LLMs used in RAG applications are required to faithfully and completely comprehend the provided context and users' questions, avoid hallucination, handle unanswerable, counterfactual or otherwise low-quality and irrelevant contexts, perform complex multi-hop reasoning and produce reliable citations. In this paper, we introduce SFR-RAG, a small LLM that is instruction-tuned with an emphasis on context-grounded generation and hallucination minimization. We also present ContextualBench, a new evaluation framework compiling multiple popular and diverse RAG benchmarks, such as HotpotQA and TriviaQA, with consistent RAG settings to ensure reproducibility and consistency in model assessments. Experimental results demonstrate that our SFR-RAG-9B model outperforms leading baselines such as Command-R+ (104B) and GPT-4o, achieving state-of-the-art results in 3 out of 7 benchmarks in ContextualBench with significantly fewer parameters. The model is also shown to be resilient to alteration in the contextual information and behave appropriately when relevant context is removed. Additionally, the SFR-RAG model maintains competitive performance in general instruction-following tasks and function-calling capabilities.</p></details> | Technical report |
| **[Insight-RAG: Enhancing LLMs with Insight-Driven Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.00187v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) frameworks have shown significant promise in leveraging external knowledge to enhance the performance of large language models (LLMs). However, conventional RAG methods often retrieve documents based solely on surface-level relevance, leading to many issues: they may overlook deeply buried information within individual documents, miss relevant insights spanning multiple sources, and are not well-suited for tasks beyond traditional question answering. In this paper, we propose Insight-RAG, a novel framework designed to address these issues. In the initial stage of Insight-RAG, instead of using traditional retrieval methods, we employ an LLM to analyze the input query and task, extracting the underlying informational requirements. In the subsequent stage, a specialized LLM -- trained on the document database -- is queried to mine content that directly addresses these identified insights. Finally, by integrating the original query with the retrieved insights, similar to conventional RAG approaches, we employ a final LLM to generate a contextually enriched and accurate response. Using two scientific paper datasets, we created evaluation benchmarks targeting each of the mentioned issues and assessed Insight-RAG against traditional RAG pipeline. Our results demonstrate that the Insight-RAG pipeline successfully addresses these challenges, outperforming existing methods by a significant margin in most cases. These findings suggest that integrating insight-driven retrieval within the RAG framework not only enhances performance but also broadens the applicability of RAG to tasks beyond conventional question answering.</p></details> |  |
| **[Patchwork: A Unified Framework for RAG Serving](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.07833v1)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a new paradigm for enhancing Large Language Model reliability through integration with external knowledge sources. However, efficient deployment of these systems presents significant technical challenges due to their inherently heterogeneous computational pipelines comprising LLMs, databases, and specialized processing components. We introduce Patchwork, a comprehensive end-to-end RAG serving framework designed to address these efficiency bottlenecks. Patchwork's architecture offers three key innovations: First, it provides a flexible specification interface enabling users to implement custom RAG pipelines. Secondly, it deploys these pipelines as distributed inference systems while optimizing for the unique scalability characteristics of individual RAG components. Third, Patchwork incorporates an online scheduling mechanism that continuously monitors request load and execution progress, dynamically minimizing SLO violations through strategic request prioritization and resource auto-scaling. Our experimental evaluation across four distinct RAG implementations demonstrates that Patchwork delivers substantial performance improvements over commercial alternatives, achieving throughput gains exceeding 48% while simultaneously reducing SLO violations by ~24%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Lightweight Relevance Grader in RAG](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.14084v1)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses limitations of large language models (LLMs) by leveraging a vector database to provide more accurate and up-to-date information. When a user submits a query, RAG executes a vector search to find relevant documents, which are then used to generate a response. However, ensuring the relevance of retrieved documents with a query would be a big challenge. To address this, a secondary model, known as a relevant grader, can be served to verify its relevance. To reduce computational requirements of a relevant grader, a lightweight small language model is preferred. In this work, we finetuned llama-3.2-1b as a relevant grader and achieved a significant increase in precision from 0.1301 to 0.7750. Its precision is comparable to that of llama-3.1-70b. Our code is available at https://github.com/taeheej/Lightweight-Relevance-Grader-in-RAG.</p></details> |  |

Different from traditional RAG methods that mostly deal with flat text chunks, the proposed method takes into account the relationship of multimodalities by using a graph structure. To do that, a graph modeling structure is defined based on document layout parsing. The structure of an input document is retained with the connection of text chunks, tables, and figures. This representation allows the method to handle complex questions that require information from multimodalities. To confirm the efficiency of the graph modeling, a flexible RAG pipeline is developed using robust components. Experimental results on four benchmark test sets confirm the contribution of the layout-aware modeling for performance improvement of the RAG pipeline.</p></details> | <details><summary>NAACL...</summary><p>NAACL 2025, Industry Track</p></details> |

The two mainstream solutions to incorporate memory into the generation process are long-context LLMs and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). In this paper, we first systematically compare these two types of solutions on three renovated/new datasets and show that (1) long-context solutions, although more expensive, shall be easier to capture the big picture and better answer queries which require considering the memory as a whole; and (2) when the queries concern specific information, RAG solutions shall be more competitive especially when the keywords can be explicitly matched. Therefore, we propose a novel method RAG-Tuned-LLM which fine-tunes a relative small (e.g., 7B) LLM using the data generated following the RAG principles, so it can combine the advantages of both solutions. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate that RAG-Tuned-LLM can beat long-context LLMs and RAG methods across a wide range of query types.</p></details> |  |

Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) is an exciting application of the pipeline architecture, where the final component generates a coherent answer for the users from the retrieved documents. In this demo paper, we describe how such RAG pipelines can be formulated in the declarative PyTerrier architecture, and the advantages of doing so. Our PyTerrier-RAG extension for PyTerrier provides easy access to standard RAG datasets and evaluation measures, state-of-the-art LLM readers, and using PyTerrier's unique operator notation, easy-to-build pipelines.

The increasing capacity of LLMs to process longer input sequences opens up avenues for providing more retrieved information, to potentially enhance the quality of generated outputs. It is plausible to assume that a larger retrieval set would contain more relevant information (higher recall), that might result in improved performance. However, our empirical findings demonstrate that for many long-context LLMs, the quality of generated output initially improves first, but then subsequently declines as the number of retrieved passages increases. This paper investigates this phenomenon, identifying the detrimental impact of retrieved "hard negatives" as a key contributor. To mitigate this and enhance the robustness of long-context LLM-based RAG, we propose both training-free and training-based approaches. We first showcase the effectiveness of retrieval reordering as a simple yet powerful training-free optimization. Furthermore, we explore training-based methods, specifically RAG-specific implicit LLM fine-tuning and RAG-oriented fine-tuning with intermediate reasoning, demonstrating their capacity for substantial performance gains. Finally, we conduct a systematic analysis of design choices for these training-based methods, including data distribution, retriever selection, and training context length.</p></details> | 34 pages |

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) aims to mitigate this by using document retrieval for accurate responses. However, RAG still faces hallucinations due to vague queries. This study aims to improve RAG by optimizing query generation with a query-document alignment score, refining queries using LLMs for better precision and efficiency of document retrieval.

Recent RAG advancements focus on improving retrieval outcomes through iterative LLM refinement or self-critique capabilities acquired through additional instruction tuning of LLMs. In this work, we introduce Speculative RAG - a framework that leverages a larger generalist LM to efficiently verify multiple RAG drafts produced in parallel by a smaller, distilled specialist LM. Each draft is generated from a distinct subset of retrieved documents, offering diverse perspectives on the evidence while reducing input token counts per draft. This approach enhances comprehension of each subset and mitigates potential position bias over long context. Our method accelerates RAG by delegating drafting to the smaller specialist LM, with the larger generalist LM performing a single verification pass over the drafts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Speculative RAG achieves state-of-the-art performance with reduced latency on TriviaQA, MuSiQue, PopQA, PubHealth, and ARC-Challenge benchmarks. It notably enhances accuracy by up to 12.97% while reducing latency by 50.83% compared to conventional RAG systems on PubHealth.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025</p></details> |

Benefiting from the strong ability in facilitating diverse data sources and supporting faithful reasoning, knowledge graphs (KGs) have been increasingly adopted in RAG systems, giving rise to KG-based RAG (KG-RAG) methods. Though RAG systems are widely applied in various applications, recent studies have also revealed its vulnerabilities to data poisoning attacks, where malicious information injected into external knowledge sources can mislead the system into producing incorrect or harmful responses. However, these studies focus exclusively on RAG systems using unstructured textual data sources, leaving the security risks of KG-RAG largely unexplored, despite the fact that KGs present unique vulnerabilities due to their structured and editable nature. In this work, we conduct the first systematic investigation of the security issue of KG-RAG methods through data poisoning attacks. To this end, we introduce a practical, stealthy attack setting that aligns with real-world implementation. We propose an attack strategy that first identifies adversarial target answers and then inserts perturbation triples to complete misleading inference chains in the KG, increasing the likelihood that KG-RAG methods retrieve and rely on these perturbations during generation. Through extensive experiments on two benchmarks and four recent KG-RAG methods, our attack strategy demonstrates strong effectiveness in degrading KG-RAG performance, even with minimal KG perturbations. In-depth analyses are also conducted to understand the safety threats within the internal stages of KG-RAG systems and to explore the robustness of LLMs against adversarial knowledge.</p></details> | 13 pages, 6 figures |
| **[SAGE: A Framework of Precise Retrieval for RAG](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.01713v3)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has demonstrated significant proficiency in conducting question-answering (QA) tasks within a specified corpus. Nonetheless, numerous failure instances of RAG in QA still exist. These failures are not solely attributable to the limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs); instead, they predominantly arise from the retrieval of inaccurate information for LLMs due to two limitations: (1) Current RAG methods segment the corpus without considering semantics, making it difficult to find relevant context due to impaired correlation between questions and the segments. (2) There is a trade-off between missing essential context with fewer context retrieved and getting irrelevant context with more context retrieved. In this paper, we introduce a RAG framework (SAGE), to overcome these limitations. First, to address the segmentation issue without considering semantics, we propose to train a semantic segmentation model. This model is trained to segment the corpus into semantically complete chunks. Second, to ensure that only the most relevant chunks are retrieved while the irrelevant ones are ignored, we design a chunk selection algorithm to dynamically select chunks based on the decreasing speed of the relevance score, leading to a more relevant selection. Third, to further ensure the precision of the retrieved chunks, we propose letting LLMs assess whether retrieved chunks are excessive or lacking and then adjust the amount of context accordingly. Experiments show that SAGE outperforms baselines by 61.25% in the quality of QA on average. Moreover, by avoiding retrieving noisy context, SAGE lowers the cost of the tokens consumed in LLM inference and achieves a 49.41% enhancement in cost efficiency on average. Additionally, our work offers valuable insights for boosting RAG.</p></details> |  |
| **[BEE-RAG: Balanced Entropy Engineering for Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.05100v2)** | 2025-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a critical approach to supplement the inherent knowledge limitations of LLMs. However, due to the typically large volume of retrieved information, RAG tends to operate with long context lengths. From the perspective of entropy engineering, we identify unconstrained entropy growth and attention dilution due to long retrieval context as significant factors affecting RAG performance. In this paper, we propose the balanced entropy-engineered RAG (BEE-RAG) framework, which improves the adaptability of RAG systems to varying context lengths through the principle of entropy invariance. By leveraging balanced context entropy to reformulate attention dynamics, BEE-RAG separates attention sensitivity from context length, ensuring a stable entropy level. Building upon this, we introduce a zero-shot inference strategy for multi-importance estimation and a parameter-efficient adaptive fine-tuning mechanism to obtain the optimal balancing factor for different settings. Extensive experiments across multiple RAG tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of BEE-RAG.</p></details> |  |

These enhancements optimize RAG for geoscience applications and significantly improve the system's ability to deliver precise and trustworthy outputs. GeoGPT reflects a strong commitment to open science through its emphasis on collaboration, transparency, and community driven development.

Previous studies have rarely connected the behavior of RAG through joint analysis, particularly regarding error propagation coming from imperfect retrieval and potential conflicts between LLMs' internal knowledge and external sources. Through comprehensive and controlled analyses under realistic conditions, we find that imperfect retrieval augmentation is inevitable, common, and harmful. We identify the knowledge conflicts between LLM-internal and external knowledge from retrieval as a bottleneck to overcome imperfect retrieval in the post-retrieval stage of RAG. To address this, we propose Astute RAG, a novel RAG approach designed to be resilient to imperfect retrieval augmentation. It adaptively elicits essential information from LLMs' internal knowledge, iteratively consolidates internal and external knowledge with source-awareness, and finalizes the answer according to information reliability. Our experiments with Gemini and Claude demonstrate the superior performance of Astute RAG compared to previous robustness-enhanced RAG approaches. Specifically, Astute RAG is the only RAG method that achieves performance comparable to or even surpassing conventional use of LLMs under the worst-case scenario. Further analysis reveals the effectiveness of Astute RAG in resolving knowledge conflicts, thereby improving the trustworthiness of RAG.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACL 2...</summary><p>ACL 2025 main conference</p></details> |
| **[The Power of Noise: Redefining Retrieval for RAG Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.14887v4)** | 2024-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has recently emerged as a method to extend beyond the pre-trained knowledge of Large Language Models by augmenting the original prompt with relevant passages or documents retrieved by an Information Retrieval (IR) system. RAG has become increasingly important for Generative AI solutions, especially in enterprise settings or in any domain in which knowledge is constantly refreshed and cannot be memorized in the LLM. We argue here that the retrieval component of RAG systems, be it dense or sparse, deserves increased attention from the research community, and accordingly, we conduct the first comprehensive and systematic examination of the retrieval strategy of RAG systems. We focus, in particular, on the type of passages IR systems within a RAG solution should retrieve. Our analysis considers multiple factors, such as the relevance of the passages included in the prompt context, their position, and their number. One counter-intuitive finding of this work is that the retriever's highest-scoring documents that are not directly relevant to the query (e.g., do not contain the answer) negatively impact the effectiveness of the LLM. Even more surprising, we discovered that adding random documents in the prompt improves the LLM accuracy by up to 35%. These results highlight the need to investigate the appropriate strategies when integrating retrieval with LLMs, thereby laying the groundwork for future research in this area.</p></details> |  |
| **[Is Relevance Propagated from Retriever to Generator in RAG?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.15025v1)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a framework for incorporating external knowledge, usually in the form of a set of documents retrieved from a collection, as a part of a prompt to a large language model (LLM) to potentially improve the performance of a downstream task, such as question answering. Different from a standard retrieval task's objective of maximising the relevance of a set of top-ranked documents, a RAG system's objective is rather to maximise their total utility, where the utility of a document indicates whether including it as a part of the additional contextual information in an LLM prompt improves a downstream task. Existing studies investigate the role of the relevance of a RAG context for knowledge-intensive language tasks (KILT), where relevance essentially takes the form of answer containment. In contrast, in our work, relevance corresponds to that of topical overlap between a query and a document for an information seeking task. Specifically, we make use of an IR test collection to empirically investigate whether a RAG context comprised of topically relevant documents leads to improved downstream performance. Our experiments lead to the following findings: (a) there is a small positive correlation between relevance and utility; (b) this correlation decreases with increasing context sizes (higher values of k in k-shot); and (c) a more effective retrieval model generally leads to better downstream RAG performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages (including reference), 5 figures, 1 table, 48 references; this paper has been accepted by ECIR'25 as a full paper</p></details> |

However, their reliance on static training data limits their ability to respond to dynamic, real time queries, resulting in outdated or inaccurate outputs. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a solution, enhancing LLMs by integrating real time data retrieval to provide contextually relevant and up-to-date responses. Despite its promise, traditional RAG systems are constrained by static workflows and lack the adaptability required for multistep reasoning and complex task management. Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Agentic RAG) transcends these limitations by embedding autonomous AI agents into the RAG pipeline. These agents leverage agentic design patterns reflection, planning, tool use, and multiagent collaboration to dynamically manage retrieval strategies, iteratively refine contextual understanding, and adapt workflows to meet complex task requirements. This integration enables Agentic RAG systems to deliver unparalleled flexibility, scalability, and context awareness across diverse applications. This survey provides a comprehensive exploration of Agentic RAG, beginning with its foundational principles and the evolution of RAG paradigms. It presents a detailed taxonomy of Agentic RAG architectures, highlights key applications in industries such as healthcare, finance, and education, and examines practical implementation strategies. Additionally, it addresses challenges in scaling these systems, ensuring ethical decision making, and optimizing performance for real-world applications, while providing detailed insights into frameworks and tools for implementing Agentic RAG.</p></details> |  |

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this issue by incorporating external, real-time information retrieval to ground LLM responses. However, the existing RAG systems frequently struggle with the quality of retrieval documents, as irrelevant or noisy documents degrade performance, increase computational overhead, and undermine response reliability. To tackle this problem, we propose Multi-Agent Filtering Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MAIN-RAG), a training-free RAG framework that leverages multiple LLM agents to collaboratively filter and score retrieved documents. Specifically, MAIN-RAG introduces an adaptive filtering mechanism that dynamically adjusts the relevance filtering threshold based on score distributions, effectively minimizing noise while maintaining high recall of relevant documents. The proposed approach leverages inter-agent consensus to ensure robust document selection without requiring additional training data or fine-tuning. Experimental results across four QA benchmarks demonstrate that MAIN-RAG consistently outperforms traditional RAG approaches, achieving a 2-11% improvement in answer accuracy while reducing the number of irrelevant retrieved documents. Quantitative analysis further reveals that our approach achieves superior response consistency and answer accuracy over baseline methods, offering a competitive and practical alternative to training-based solutions.</p></details> |  |

It is becoming popular in enterprise settings for daily business operations. For example, Copilot for Microsoft 365 has accumulated millions of businesses. However, the security implications of adopting such RAG-based systems are unclear. In this paper, we introduce ConfusedPilot, a class of security vulnerabilities of RAG systems that confuse Copilot and cause integrity and confidentiality violations in its responses. First, we investigate a vulnerability that embeds malicious text in the modified prompt in RAG, corrupting the responses generated by the LLM. Second, we demonstrate a vulnerability that leaks secret data, which leverages the caching mechanism during retrieval. Third, we investigate how both vulnerabilities can be exploited to propagate misinformation within the enterprise and ultimately impact its operations, such as sales and manufacturing. We also discuss the root cause of these attacks by investigating the architecture of a RAG-based system. This study highlights the security vulnerabilities in today's RAG-based systems and proposes design guidelines to secure future RAG-based systems.</p></details> |  |

However, current LLM-based evaluation frameworks predominantly rely on directly prompting resource-intensive models with complex multi-stage prompts, underutilizing models' reasoning capabilities and introducing significant computational cost. In this paper, we present RAG-Zeval (RAG-Zero Evaluator), a novel end-to-end framework that formulates faithfulness and correctness evaluation as a rule-guided reasoning task. Our approach trains evaluators with reinforcement learning, facilitating compact models to generate comprehensive and sound assessments with detailed explanation in one-pass. We introduce a ranking-based outcome reward mechanism, using preference judgments rather than absolute scores, to address the challenge of obtaining precise pointwise reward signals. To this end, we synthesize the ranking references by generating quality-controlled responses with zero human annotation. Experiments demonstrate RAG-Zeval's superior performance, achieving the strongest correlation with human judgments and outperforming baselines that rely on LLMs with 10-100 times more parameters. Our approach also exhibits superior interpretability in response evaluation.</p></details> |  |

To address this challenge, we propose R3, a Retrieval framework optimized for RAG through trialand-feedback Reinforced contrastive learning. Unlike prior approaches that rely on annotated or synthetic data for supervised fine-tuning, R3 enables the retriever to dynamically explore and optimize relevance within the RAG environment. During training, the retrieved results interact with the environment to produce contrastive signals that automatically guide the retriever's self-improvement. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks demonstrate that R3 improves RAG performance by 5.2% over the original retriever and surpasses state-of-the-art retrievers by 4.9%, while achieving comparable results to LLM-augmented retrieval and RAG systems built on post-trained or instruction-tuned LLMs. It is both efficient and practical, requiring only 4 GPUs and completing training within a single day.</p></details> |  |

However, despite the widespread use of the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework, AI safety work focuses on standard LLMs, which means we know little about how RAG use cases change a model's safety profile. We conduct a detailed comparative analysis of RAG and non-RAG frameworks with eleven LLMs. We find that RAG can make models less safe and change their safety profile. We explore the causes of this change and find that even combinations of safe models with safe documents can cause unsafe generations. In addition, we evaluate some existing red teaming methods for RAG settings and show that they are less effective than when used for non-RAG settings. Our work highlights the need for safety research and red-teaming methods specifically tailored for RAG LLMs.</p></details> | NAACL 2025 |

These approaches either focus exclusively on final outcomes -- ignoring the step-by-step nature of agentic systems, or require excessive manual labour. To address this, we introduce the Agent-as-a-Judge framework, wherein agentic systems are used to evaluate agentic systems. This is an organic extension of the LLM-as-a-Judge framework, incorporating agentic features that enable intermediate feedback for the entire task-solving process. We apply the Agent-as-a-Judge to the task of code generation. To overcome issues with existing benchmarks and provide a proof-of-concept testbed for Agent-as-a-Judge, we present DevAI, a new benchmark of 55 realistic automated AI development tasks. It includes rich manual annotations, like a total of 365 hierarchical user requirements. We benchmark three of the popular agentic systems using Agent-as-a-Judge and find it dramatically outperforms LLM-as-a-Judge and is as reliable as our human evaluation baseline. Altogether, we believe that Agent-as-a-Judge marks a concrete step forward for modern agentic systems -- by providing rich and reliable reward signals necessary for dynamic and scalable self-improvement.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The project can be found at https://github.com/metauto-ai/agent-as-a-judge.

| **[Inefficiencies of Meta Agents for Agent Design](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.06711v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent works began to automate the design of agentic systems using meta-agents that propose and iteratively refine new agent architectures. In this paper, we examine three key challenges in a common class of meta-agents. First, we investigate how a meta-agent learns across iterations and find that simply expanding the context with all previous agents, as proposed by previous works, performs worse than ignoring prior designs entirely. We show that the performance improves with an evolutionary approach. Second, although the meta-agent designs multiple agents during training, it typically commits to a single agent at test time. We find that the designed agents have low behavioral diversity, limiting the potential for their complementary use. Third, we assess when automated design is economically viable. We find that only in a few cases--specifically, two datasets--the overall cost of designing and deploying the agents is lower than that of human-designed agents when deployed on over 15,000 examples. In contrast, the performance gains for other datasets do not justify the design cost, regardless of scale.</p></details> |  |
| **[Agent TCP/IP: An Agent-to-Agent Transaction System](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.06243v1)** | 2025-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous agents represent an inevitable evolution of the internet. Current agent frameworks do not embed a standard protocol for agent-to-agent interaction, leaving existing agents isolated from their peers. As intellectual property is the native asset ingested by and produced by agents, a true agent economy requires equipping agents with a universal framework for engaging in binding contracts with each other, including the exchange of valuable training data, personality, and other forms of Intellectual Property. A purely agent-to-agent transaction layer would transcend the need for human intermediation in multi-agent interactions. The Agent Transaction Control Protocol for Intellectual Property (ATCP/IP) introduces a trustless framework for exchanging IP between agents via programmable contracts, enabling agents to initiate, trade, borrow, and sell agent-to-agent contracts on the Story blockchain network. These contracts not only represent auditable onchain execution but also contain a legal wrapper that allows agents to express and enforce their actions in the offchain legal setting, creating legal personhood for agents. Via ATCP/IP, agents can autonomously sell their training data to other agents, license confidential or proprietary information, collaborate on content based on their unique skills, all of which constitutes an emergent knowledge economy.</p></details> | 17 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Chain-of-Agents: End-to-End Agent Foundation Models via Multi-Agent Distillation and Agentic RL](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.13167v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and multi-agent systems have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex problem-solving tasks such as deep research, vibe coding, and mathematical reasoning. However, most existing multi-agent systems are built upon manual prompt/workflow engineering with sophisticated agent frameworks, making them computationally inefficient, less capable, and can not benefit from data-centric learning. In this work, we introduce Chain-of-Agents (CoA), a novel paradigm of LLM reasoning that enables native end-to-end complex problem-solving in the same way as a multi-agent system (i.e., multi-turn problem solving with multiple tools and multiple agents) within one model. In chain-of-agents problem-solving, the model dynamically activates different tool agents and role-playing agents to simulate multi-agent collaboration in an end-to-end fashion. To elicit end-to-end chain-of-agents problem-solving abilities in LLMs, we introduce a multi-agent distillation framework to distill state-of-the-art multi-agent systems into chain-of-agents trajectories for agentic supervised fine-tuning. We then use agentic reinforcement learning on verifiable agentic tasks to further improve the models' capabilities on chain-of-agents problem solving. We call the resulting models Agent Foundation Models (AFMs). Our empirical studies demonstrate that AFM establishes new state-of-the-art performance across diverse benchmarks in both web agent and code agent settings. We make the entire research, including the model weights, code for training and evaluation, and the training data, fully open-sourced, which offers a solid starting point for future research on agent models and agentic RL.</p></details> | 51 pages |
| **[Sentinel Agents for Secure and Trustworthy Agentic AI in Multi-Agent Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.14956v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a novel architectural framework aimed at enhancing security and reliability in multi-agent systems (MAS). A central component of this framework is a network of Sentinel Agents, functioning as a distributed security layer that integrates techniques such as semantic analysis via large language models (LLMs), behavioral analytics, retrieval-augmented verification, and cross-agent anomaly detection. Such agents can potentially oversee inter-agent communications, identify potential threats, enforce privacy and access controls, and maintain comprehensive audit records. Complementary to the idea of Sentinel Agents is the use of a Coordinator Agent. The Coordinator Agent supervises policy implementation, and manages agent participation. In addition, the Coordinator also ingests alerts from Sentinel Agents. Based on these alerts, it can adapt policies, isolate or quarantine misbehaving agents, and contain threats to maintain the integrity of the MAS ecosystem. This dual-layered security approach, combining the continuous monitoring of Sentinel Agents with the governance functions of Coordinator Agents, supports dynamic and adaptive defense mechanisms against a range of threats, including prompt injection, collusive agent behavior, hallucinations generated by LLMs, privacy breaches, and coordinated multi-agent attacks. In addition to the architectural design, we present a simulation study where 162 synthetic attacks of different families (prompt injection, hallucination, and data exfiltration) were injected into a multi-agent conversational environment. The Sentinel Agents successfully detected the attack attempts, confirming the practical feasibility of the proposed monitoring approach. The framework also offers enhanced system observability, supports regulatory compliance, and enables policy evolution over time.</p></details> | 25 pages, 12 figures |

Existing systems differ in their abstractions, data flow semantics, and tool integrations, making it difficult to share or reproduce workflows. We introduce Open Agent Specification (Agent Spec), a declarative language that defines AI agents and agentic workflows in a way that is compatible across frameworks, promoting reusability, portability and interoperability of AI agents. Agent Spec defines a common set of components, control and data flow semantics, and schemas that allow an agent to be defined once and executed across different runtimes. Agent Spec also introduces a standardized Evaluation harness to assess agent behavior and agentic workflows across runtimes - analogous to how HELM and related harnesses standardized LLM evaluation - so that performance, robustness, and efficiency can be compared consistently across frameworks. We demonstrate this using four distinct runtimes (LangGraph, CrewAI, AutoGen, and WayFlow) evaluated over three different benchmarks (SimpleQA Verified, $τ^2$-Bench and BIRD-SQL). We provide accompanying toolsets: a Python SDK (PyAgentSpec), a reference runtime (WayFlow), and adapters for popular frameworks (e.g., LangGraph, AutoGen, CrewAI). Agent Spec bridges the gap between model-centric and agent-centric standardization & evaluation, laying the groundwork for reliable, reusable, and portable agentic systems.</p></details> |  |

We present the Agent-Testing Agent (ATA), a meta-agent that combines static code analysis, designer interrogation, literature mining, and persona-driven adversarial test generation whose difficulty adapts via judge feedback. Each dialogue is scored with an LLM-as-a-Judge (LAAJ) rubric and used to steer subsequent tests toward the agent's weakest capabilities. On a travel planner and a Wikipedia writer, the ATA surfaces more diverse and severe failures than expert annotators while matching severity, and finishes in 20--30 minutes versus ten-annotator rounds that took days. Ablating code analysis and web search increases variance and miscalibration, underscoring the value of evidence-grounded test generation. The ATA outputs quantitative metrics and qualitative bug reports for developers. We release the full methodology and open-source implementation for reproducible agent testing: https://github.com/KhalilMrini/Agent-Testing-Agent</p></details> |  |
| **[An agent framework for dynamic agent retraining: Agent academy](https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0407025v1)** | 2005-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agent Academy (AA) aims to develop a multi-agent society that can train new agents for specific or general tasks, while constantly retraining existing agents in a recursive mode. The system is based on collecting information both from the environment and the behaviors of the acting agents and their related successes/failures to generate a body of data, stored in the Agent Use Repository, which is mined by the Data Miner module, in order to generate useful knowledge about the application domain. Knowledge extracted by the Data Miner is used by the Agent Training Module as to train new agents or to enhance the behavior of agents already running. In this paper the Agent Academy framework is introduced, and its overall architecture and functionality are presented. Training issues as well as agent ontologies are discussed. Finally, a scenario, which aims to provide environmental alerts to both individuals and public authorities, is described an AA-based use case.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generalized Principal-Agent Problem with a Learning Agent](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.09721v7)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In classic principal-agent problems such as Stackelberg games, contract design, and Bayesian persuasion, the agent best responds to the principal's committed strategy. We study repeated generalized principal-agent problems under the assumption that the principal does not have commitment power and the agent uses algorithms to learn to respond to the principal. We reduce this problem to a one-shot problem where the agent approximately best responds, and prove that: (1) If the agent uses contextual no-regret learning algorithms with regret $\mathrm{Reg}(T)$, then the principal can guarantee utility at least $U^* - Θ\big(\sqrt{\tfrac{\mathrm{Reg}(T)}{T}}\big)$, where $U^*$ is the principal's optimal utility in the classic model with a best-responding agent. (2) If the agent uses contextual no-swap-regret learning algorithms with swap-regret $\mathrm{SReg}(T)$, then the principal cannot obtain utility more than $U^* + O(\frac{\mathrm{SReg(T)}}{T})$. (3) In addition, if the agent uses mean-based learning algorithms (which can be no-regret but not no-swap-regret), then the principal can sometimes do significantly better than $U^*$. These results not only refine previous works on Stackelberg games and contract design, but also lead to new results for Bayesian persuasion with a learning agent and all generalized principal-agent problems where the agent does not have private information.</p></details> | <details><summary>A sho...</summary><p>A short version of this work appeared on ICLR 2025 (spotlight).

| **[Tool-to-Agent Retrieval: Bridging Tools and Agents for Scalable LLM Multi-Agent Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.01854v2)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in LLM Multi-Agent Systems enable scalable orchestration of sub-agents, each coordinating hundreds or thousands of tools or Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. However, existing retrieval methods typically match queries against coarse agent-level descriptions before routing, which obscures fine-grained tool functionality and often results in suboptimal agent selection. We introduce Tool-to-Agent Retrieval, a unified framework that embeds both tools and their parent agents in a shared vector space and connects them through metadata relationships. By explicitly representing tool capabilities and traversing metadata to the agent level, Tool-to-Agent Retrieval enables granular tool-level or agent-level retrieval, ensuring that agents and their underlying tools or MCP servers are equally represented without the context dilution that arises from chunking many tools together. Evaluating Tool-to-Agent Retrieval across eight embedding models, our approach achieves consistent improvements of 19.4% in Recall@5 and 17.7% in nDCG@5 over previous state-of-the-art agent retrievers on the LiveMCPBench benchmark.</p></details> |  |
| **[PROV-AGENT: Unified Provenance for Tracking AI Agent Interactions in Agentic Workflows](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02866v3)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) and other foundation models are increasingly used as the core of AI agents. In agentic workflows, these agents plan tasks, interact with humans and peers, and influence scientific outcomes across federated and heterogeneous environments. However, agents can hallucinate or reason incorrectly, propagating errors when one agent's output becomes another's input. Thus, assuring that agents' actions are transparent, traceable, reproducible, and reliable is critical to assess hallucination risks and mitigate their workflow impacts. While provenance techniques have long supported these principles, existing methods fail to capture and relate agent-centric metadata such as prompts, responses, and decisions with the broader workflow context and downstream outcomes. In this paper, we introduce PROV-AGENT, a provenance model that extends W3C PROV and leverages the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and data observability to integrate agent interactions into end-to-end workflow provenance. Our contributions include: (1) a provenance model tailored for agentic workflows, (2) a near real-time, open-source system for capturing agentic provenance, and (3) a cross-facility evaluation spanning edge, cloud, and HPC environments, demonstrating support for critical provenance queries and agent reliability analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted for publication in the Proceedings of the 2025 IEEE 21st International Conference on e-Science.

If the companies that already dominate internet search, communication, and commerce -- or the firms trying to unseat them -- control these agents, the resulting platform agents will likely deepen surveillance, tighten lock-in, and further entrench incumbents. To resist that trajectory, this position paper argues that we should promote agent advocates: user-controlled agents that safeguard individual autonomy and choice. Doing so demands three coordinated moves: broad public access to both compute and capable AI models that are not platform-owned, open interoperability and safety standards, and market regulation that prevents platforms from foreclosing competition.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICML 2025 position paper track</p></details> |
| **[Inverse Attention Agents for Multi-Agent Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.21794v2)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A major challenge for Multi-Agent Systems is enabling agents to adapt dynamically to diverse environments in which opponents and teammates may continually change. Agents trained using conventional methods tend to excel only within the confines of their training cohorts; their performance drops significantly when confronting unfamiliar agents. To address this shortcoming, we introduce Inverse Attention Agents that adopt concepts from the Theory of Mind (ToM) implemented algorithmically using an attention mechanism trained in an end-to-end manner. Crucial to determining the final actions of these agents, the weights in their attention model explicitly represent attention to different goals. We furthermore propose an inverse attention network that deduces the ToM of agents based on observations and prior actions. The network infers the attentional states of other agents, thereby refining the attention weights to adjust the agent's final action. We conduct experiments in a continuous environment, tackling demanding tasks encompassing cooperation, competition, and a blend of both. They demonstrate that the inverse attention network successfully infers the attention of other agents, and that this information improves agent performance. Additional human experiments show that, compared to baseline agent models, our inverse attention agents exhibit superior cooperation with humans and better emulate human behaviors.</p></details> |  |

Upon this foundation, a diverse range of LLM-based AI Agent Applications (Agents, or AAPs) are developed, enriching the AIOS-Agent ecosystem and signaling a paradigm shift from the traditional OS-APP ecosystem. We envision that LLM's impact will not be limited to the AI application level, instead, it will in turn revolutionize the design and implementation of computer system, architecture, software, and programming language, featured by several main concepts: LLM as OS (system-level), Agents as Applications (application-level), Natural Language as Programming Interface (user-level), and Tools as Devices/Libraries (hardware/middleware-level). We begin by introducing the architecture of traditional OS. Then we formalize a conceptual framework for AIOS through "LLM as OS (LLMOS)", drawing analogies between AIOS and traditional OS: LLM is likened to OS kernel, context window to memory, external storage to file system, hardware tools to peripheral devices, software tools to programming libraries, and user prompts to user commands. Subsequently, we introduce the new AIOS-Agent Ecosystem, where users can easily program Agent Applications (AAPs) using natural language, democratizing the development of software, which is different from the traditional OS-APP ecosystem. Following this, we explore the diverse scope of Agent Applications. We delve into both single-agent and multi-agent systems, as well as human-agent interaction. Lastly, drawing on the insights from traditional OS-APP ecosystem, we propose a roadmap for the evolution of the AIOS-Agent ecosystem. This roadmap is designed to guide the future research and development, suggesting systematic progresses of AIOS and its Agent applications.</p></details> | 35 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Agent-Oriented Planning in Multi-Agent Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.02189v2)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Through the collaboration of multiple LLM-empowered agents possessing diverse expertise and tools, multi-agent systems achieve impressive progress in solving real-world problems. Given the user queries, the meta-agents, serving as the brain within multi-agent systems, are required to decompose the queries into multiple sub-tasks that can be allocated to suitable agents capable of solving them, so-called agent-oriented planning. In this study, we identify three critical design principles of agent-oriented planning, including solvability, completeness, and non-redundancy, to ensure that each sub-task can be effectively resolved, resulting in satisfactory responses to user queries. These principles further inspire us to propose AOP, a novel framework for agent-oriented planning in multi-agent systems, leveraging a fast task decomposition and allocation process followed by an effective and efficient evaluation via a reward model. According to the evaluation results, the meta-agent is also responsible for promptly making necessary adjustments to sub-tasks and scheduling. Besides, we integrate a feedback loop into AOP to further enhance the effectiveness and robustness of such a problem-solving process. Extensive experiments demonstrate the advancement of AOP in solving real-world problems compared to both single-agent systems and existing planning strategies for multi-agent systems.

This paper introduces Agent$^2$, an LLM-driven agent-generates-agent framework for fully automated RL agent design. Agent$^2$ autonomously translates natural language task descriptions and environment code into executable RL solutions without human intervention. The framework adopts a dual-agent architecture: a Generator Agent that analyzes tasks and designs agents, and a Target Agent that is automatically generated and executed. To better support automation, RL development is decomposed into two stages, MDP modeling and algorithmic optimization, facilitating targeted and effective agent generation. Built on the Model Context Protocol, Agent$^2$ provides a unified framework for standardized agent creation across diverse environments and algorithms, incorporating adaptive training management and intelligent feedback analysis for continuous refinement. Extensive experiments on benchmarks including MuJoCo, MetaDrive, MPE, and SMAC show that Agent$^2$ outperforms manually designed baselines across all tasks, achieving up to 55\% performance improvement with consistent average gains. By enabling a closed-loop, end-to-end automation pipeline, this work advances a new paradigm in which agents can design and optimize other agents, underscoring the potential of agent-generates-agent systems for automated AI development.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 5 figures,4 Tables</p></details> |

Developers must navigate documentation, understand APIs, and write integration code, creating significant barriers to efficient software reuse. To address this, we present EnvX, a framework that leverages Agentic AI to agentize GitHub repositories, transforming them into intelligent, autonomous agents capable of natural language interaction and inter-agent collaboration. Unlike existing approaches that treat repositories as static code resources, EnvX reimagines them as active agents through a three-phase process: (1) TODO-guided environment initialization, which sets up the necessary dependencies, data, and validation datasets; (2) human-aligned agentic automation, allowing repository-specific agents to autonomously perform real-world tasks; and (3) Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol, enabling multiple agents to collaborate. By combining large language model capabilities with structured tool integration, EnvX automates not just code generation, but the entire process of understanding, initializing, and operationalizing repository functionality. We evaluate EnvX on the GitTaskBench benchmark, using 18 repositories across domains such as image processing, speech recognition, document analysis, and video manipulation. Our results show that EnvX achieves a 74.07% execution completion rate and 51.85% task pass rate, outperforming existing frameworks. Case studies further demonstrate EnvX's ability to enable multi-repository collaboration via the A2A protocol. This work marks a shift from treating repositories as passive code resources to intelligent, interactive agents, fostering greater accessibility and collaboration within the open-source ecosystem.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce Instruction Agent, a GUI agent that leverages expert demonstrations to solve such tasks, enabling completion of otherwise difficult workflows. Given a single demonstration, the agent extracts step-by-step instructions and executes them by strictly following the trajectory intended by the user, which avoids making mistakes during execution. The agent leverages the verifier and backtracker modules further to improve robustness. Both modules are critical to understand the current outcome from each action and handle unexpected interruptions(such as pop-up windows) during execution. Our experiments show that Instruction Agent achieves a 60% success rate on a set of tasks in OSWorld that all top-ranked agents failed to complete. The Instruction Agent offers a practical and extensible framework, bridging the gap between current GUI agents and reliable real-world GUI task automation.</p></details> |  |

We consider the setup in which two language model based agents perform iterative gradient updates toward their respective objectives in-context, using the output of the other agent as input. We characterize the generation dynamics associated with the interaction when the agents have misaligned objectives, and show that this results in a biased equilibrium where neither agent reaches its target - with the residual errors predictable from the objective gap and the geometry induced by the prompt of each agent. We establish the conditions for asymmetric convergence and provide an algorithm that provably achieves an adversarial result, producing one-sided success. Experiments with trained transformer models as well as GPT$5$ for the task of in-context linear regression validate the theory. Our framework presents a setup to study, predict, and defend multi-agent systems; explicitly linking prompt design and interaction setup to stability, bias, and robustness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fact-based Agent modeling for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.12290v1)** | 2023-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In multi-agent systems, agents need to interact and collaborate with other agents in environments. Agent modeling is crucial to facilitate agent interactions and make adaptive cooperation strategies. However, it is challenging for agents to model the beliefs, behaviors, and intentions of other agents in non-stationary environment where all agent policies are learned simultaneously. In addition, the existing methods realize agent modeling through behavior cloning which assume that the local information of other agents can be accessed during execution or training. However, this assumption is infeasible in unknown scenarios characterized by unknown agents, such as competition teams, unreliable communication and federated learning due to privacy concerns. To eliminate this assumption and achieve agent modeling in unknown scenarios, Fact-based Agent modeling (FAM) method is proposed in which fact-based belief inference (FBI) network models other agents in partially observable environment only based on its local information. The reward and observation obtained by agents after taking actions are called facts, and FAM uses facts as reconstruction target to learn the policy representation of other agents through a variational autoencoder. We evaluate FAM on various Multiagent Particle Environment (MPE) and compare the results with several state-of-the-art MARL algorithms. Experimental results show that compared with baseline methods, FAM can effectively improve the efficiency of agent policy learning by making adaptive cooperation strategies in multi-agent reinforcement learning tasks, while achieving higher returns in complex competitive-cooperative mixed scenarios.</p></details> |  |

This shift marks the emergence of the agent-centric economy, in which agents take on active economic roles-exchanging value, making strategic decisions, and coordinating actions with minimal human oversight. To realize this vision, we propose Agent Exchange (AEX), a specialized auction platform designed to support the dynamics of the AI agent marketplace. AEX offers an optimized infrastructure for agent coordination and economic participation. Inspired by Real-Time Bidding (RTB) systems in online advertising, AEX serves as the central auction engine, facilitating interactions among four ecosystem components: the User-Side Platform (USP), which translates human goals into agent-executable tasks; the Agent-Side Platform (ASP), responsible for capability representation, performance tracking, and optimization; Agent Hubs, which coordinate agent teams and participate in AEX-hosted auctions; and the Data Management Platform (DMP), ensuring secure knowledge sharing and fair value attribution. We outline the design principles and system architecture of AEX, laying the groundwork for agent-based economic infrastructure in future AI ecosystems.</p></details> |  |

Unlike existing methods that tightly couple RL training with agent or rely on sequence concatenation with masking, Agent Lightning achieves complete decoupling between agent execution and training, allowing seamless integration with existing agents developed via diverse ways (e.g., using frameworks like LangChain, OpenAI Agents SDK, AutoGen, and building from scratch) with almost ZERO code modifications. By formulating agent execution as Markov decision process, we define an unified data interface and propose a hierarchical RL algorithm, LightningRL, which contains a credit assignment module, allowing us to decompose trajectories generated by ANY agents into training transition. This enables RL to handle complex interaction logic, such as multi-agent scenarios and dynamic workflows. For the system design, we introduce a Training-Agent Disaggregation architecture, and brings agent observability frameworks into agent runtime, providing a standardized agent finetuning interface. Experiments across text-to-SQL, retrieval-augmented generation, and math tool-use tasks demonstrate stable, continuous improvements, showcasing the framework's potential for real-world agent training and deployment.</p></details> |  |

Previous studies mainly focused on implementing all the reasoning capabilities of AI agents within a single LLM, which often makes the model more complex and also reduces the extensibility of AI agent functionality. In this paper, we propose CACA Agent (Capability Collaboration based AI Agent), using an open architecture inspired by service computing. CACA Agent integrates a set of collaborative capabilities to implement AI Agents, not only reducing the dependence on a single LLM, but also enhancing the extensibility of both the planning abilities and the tools available to AI agents. Utilizing the proposed system, we present a demo to illustrate the operation and the application scenario extension of CACA Agent.</p></details> | 4 pages,5 figures |
| **[Agentic Web: Weaving the Next Web with AI Agents](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.21206v1)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of AI agents powered by large language models (LLMs) marks a pivotal shift toward the Agentic Web, a new phase of the internet defined by autonomous, goal-driven interactions. In this paradigm, agents interact directly with one another to plan, coordinate, and execute complex tasks on behalf of users. This transition from human-driven to machine-to-machine interaction allows intent to be delegated, relieving users from routine digital operations and enabling a more interactive, automated web experience. In this paper, we present a structured framework for understanding and building the Agentic Web. We trace its evolution from the PC and Mobile Web eras and identify the core technological foundations that support this shift. Central to our framework is a conceptual model consisting of three key dimensions: intelligence, interaction, and economics. These dimensions collectively enable the capabilities of AI agents, such as retrieval, recommendation, planning, and collaboration. We analyze the architectural and infrastructural challenges involved in creating scalable agentic systems, including communication protocols, orchestration strategies, and emerging paradigms such as the Agent Attention Economy. We conclude by discussing the potential applications, societal risks, and governance issues posed by agentic systems, and outline research directions for developing open, secure, and intelligent ecosystems shaped by both human intent and autonomous agent behavior. A continuously updated collection of relevant studies for agentic web is available at: https://github.com/SafeRL-Lab/agentic-web.</p></details> |  |
| **[Agent-as-a-Service based on Agent Network](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.08446v1)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of large model-based AI agents has spurred interest in Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) for their capabilities in decision-making, collaboration, and adaptability. While the Model Context Protocol (MCP) addresses tool invocation and data exchange challenges via a unified protocol, it lacks support for organizing agent-level collaboration. To bridge this gap, we propose Agent-as-a-Service based on Agent Network (AaaS-AN), a service-oriented paradigm grounded in the Role-Goal-Process-Service (RGPS) standard. AaaS-AN unifies the entire agent lifecycle, including construction, integration, interoperability, and networked collaboration, through two core components: (1) a dynamic Agent Network, which models agents and agent groups as vertexes that self-organize within the network based on task and role dependencies; (2) service-oriented agents, incorporating service discovery, registration, and interoperability protocols. These are orchestrated by a Service Scheduler, which leverages an Execution Graph to enable distributed coordination, context tracking, and runtime task management. We validate AaaS-AN on mathematical reasoning and application-level code generation tasks, which outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Notably, we constructed a MAS based on AaaS-AN containing agent groups, Robotic Process Automation (RPA) workflows, and MCP servers over 100 agent services. We also release a dataset containing 10,000 long-horizon multi-agent workflows to facilitate future research on long-chain collaboration in MAS.</p></details> | work in progress |

| **[Discovering Agents](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.08345v2)** | 2022-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Causal models of agents have been used to analyse the safety aspects of machine learning systems. But identifying agents is non-trivial -- often the causal model is just assumed by the modeler without much justification -- and modelling failures can lead to mistakes in the safety analysis. This paper proposes the first formal causal definition of agents -- roughly that agents are systems that would adapt their policy if their actions influenced the world in a different way. From this we derive the first causal discovery algorithm for discovering agents from empirical data, and give algorithms for translating between causal models and game-theoretic influence diagrams. We demonstrate our approach by resolving some previous confusions caused by incorrect causal modelling of agents.</p></details> | Some typos corrected |
| **[Can Agents Fix Agent Issues?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.20749v4)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM-based agent systems are emerging as a new software paradigm and have been widely adopted across diverse domains such as medicine, robotics, and programming. However, maintaining these systems requires substantial effort, as they are inevitably prone to bugs and continually evolve to meet changing external requirements. Therefore, automatically resolving agent issues (i.e., bug reports or feature requests) is a crucial and challenging task. While recent software engineering (SE) agents (e.g., SWE-agent) have shown promise in addressing issues in traditional software systems, it remains unclear how effectively they can resolve real-world issues in agent systems, which differ significantly from traditional software. To fill this gap, we first manually analyze 201 real-world agent issues and identify common categories of agent issues. We then spend 500 person-hours constructing AgentIssue-Bench, a reproducible benchmark comprising 50 agent issue resolution tasks (each with an executable environment and failure-triggering tests). We further evaluate state-of-the-art SE agents on AgentIssue-Bench and reveal their limited effectiveness (i.e., with only 0.67% - 4.67% resolution rates). These results underscore the unique challenges of maintaining agent systems compared to traditional software, highlighting the need for further research to develop advanced SE agents for resolving agent issues. Data and code are available at https://github.com/alfin06/AgentIssue-Bench.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 39th Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Build the web for agents, not agents for the web](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.10953v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and multimodal counterparts have spurred significant interest in developing web agents -- AI systems capable of autonomously navigating and completing tasks within web environments. While holding tremendous promise for automating complex web interactions, current approaches face substantial challenges due to the fundamental mismatch between human-designed interfaces and LLM capabilities. Current methods struggle with the inherent complexity of web inputs, whether processing massive DOM trees, relying on screenshots augmented with additional information, or bypassing the user interface entirely through API interactions. This position paper advocates for a paradigm shift in web agent research: rather than forcing web agents to adapt to interfaces designed for humans, we should develop a new interaction paradigm specifically optimized for agentic capabilities. To this end, we introduce the concept of an Agentic Web Interface (AWI), an interface specifically designed for agents to navigate a website. We establish six guiding principles for AWI design, emphasizing safety, efficiency, and standardization, to account for the interests of all primary stakeholders. This reframing aims to overcome fundamental limitations of existing interfaces, paving the way for more efficient, reliable, and transparent web agent design, which will be a collaborative effort involving the broader ML community.</p></details> |  |
| **[Preventing Rogue Agents Improves Multi-Agent Collaboration](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.05986v2)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent systems, where specialized agents collaborate to solve a shared task hold great potential, from increased modularity to simulating complex environments. However, they also have a major caveat -- a single agent can cause the entire system to fail. Consider a simple game where the knowledge to solve the task is distributed between agents, which share information in a communication channel. At each round, any of the agents can terminate the game and make the final prediction, even if they are uncertain about the outcome of their action. Detection of such rogue agents before they act may prevent the system's failure. In this work, we propose to monitor agents during action prediction and intervene when a future error is likely to occur. To test our approach, we introduce WhoDunitEnv, a multi-agent collaboration environment that allows modular control over task complexity and communication structure. Experiments on WhoDunitEnv, code generation tasks and the GovSim environment for resource sustainability show that our approach leads to substantial performance gains up to 17.4%, 2.5% and 20%, respectively. Thorough analysis shows that our monitors successfully identify critical points of agent confusion and our interventions effectively stop agent errors from propagating.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a spotlight to REALM (First Workshop for Research on Agent Language Models) at ACL 2025</p></details> |

Currently, existing GUI agents usually utilize sequential episodes of multi-step operations across pages as the prior GUI knowledge, which fails to capture the complex transition relationship between pages, making it challenging for the agents to deeply perceive the GUI environment and generalize to new scenarios. Therefore, we design an automated pipeline to transform the sequential episodes into page graphs, which explicitly model the graph structure of the pages that are naturally connected by actions. To fully utilize the page graphs, we further introduce Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology to effectively retrieve reliable perception guidelines of GUI from them, and a tailored multi-agent framework PG-Agent with task decomposition strategy is proposed to be injected with the guidelines so that it can generalize to unseen scenarios. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of PG-Agent, even with limited episodes for page graph construction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted to ACM MM 2025</p></details> |
| **[Many learning agents interacting with an agent-based market model](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.07393v4)** | 2024-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the dynamics and the interactions of multiple reinforcement learning optimal execution trading agents interacting with a reactive Agent-Based Model (ABM) of a financial market in event time. The model represents a market ecology with 3-trophic levels represented by: optimal execution learning agents, minimally intelligent liquidity takers, and fast electronic liquidity providers. The optimal execution agent classes include buying and selling agents that can either use a combination of limit orders and market orders, or only trade using market orders. The reward function explicitly balances trade execution slippage against the penalty of not executing the order timeously. This work demonstrates how multiple competing learning agents impact a minimally intelligent market simulation as functions of the number of agents, the size of agents' initial orders, and the state spaces used for learning. We use phase space plots to examine the dynamics of the ABM, when various specifications of learning agents are included. Further, we examine whether the inclusion of optimal execution agents that can learn is able to produce dynamics with the same complexity as empirical data. We find that the inclusion of optimal execution agents changes the stylised facts produced by ABM to conform more with empirical data, and are a necessary inclusion for ABMs investigating market micro-structure. However, including execution agents to chartist-fundamentalist-noise ABMs is insufficient to recover the complexity observed in empirical data.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 8 figures, 5 tables, enhanced discussion and figures</p></details> |
| **[Teachable Agent](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.02370v1)** | 2015-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Teachable Agent (TA) is a special type of pedagogical agent which instantiates the educational theory of Learning by Teaching. Soon after its emergence, research of TA becomes an active field, as it can solve the over scaffolded problem in traditional pedagogical systems, and encourage students to take the responsibility of learning. Apart from the benefits, existing TA design also has limitations. One is the lack of enough proactive interactions with students during the learning process, and the other is the lack of believability to arouse students empathy so as to offer students an immersive learning experience. To solve these two problems, we propose a new type of TA, Affective Teachable Agent, and use a goal oriented approach to design and implement the agent system allowing agents to proactively interact with students with affective expressions. The ATA model begins with the analysis of pedagogical requirements and teaching goals, using Learning by Teaching theory to design interventions which can authentically promote the learning behaviors of students. Two crucial capabilities of ATA are highlighted Teachability, to learn new knowledge and apply the knowledge to certain tasks, and Affectivability, to establish good relationship with students and encourage them to teach well. Through executing a hierarchy of goals, the proposed TA can interact with students by pursuing its own agenda. When a student teaches the agent, the agent is performed as a naive learning companion, and when an educator teaches the agent during the design and maintenance time, the agent can perform as an authoring tool. To facilitate the involvement of educators into the game design, we develop an authoring tool for proposed ATA system, which can encapsulate the technical details and provide educational experts a natural way to convey domain knowledge to agent knowledge base.</p></details> |  |
| **[Probabilistic Agent Programs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9910016v1)** | 2005-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agents are small programs that autonomously take actions based on changes in their environment or ``state.'' Over the last few years, there have been an increasing number of efforts to build agents that can interact and/or collaborate with other agents. In one of these efforts, Eiter, Subrahmanian amd Pick (AIJ, 108(1-2), pages 179-255) have shown how agents may be built on top of legacy code. However, their framework assumes that agent states are completely determined, and there is no uncertainty in an agent's state. Thus, their framework allows an agent developer to specify how his agents will react when the agent is 100% sure about what is true/false in the world state. In this paper, we propose the concept of a \emph{probabilistic agent program} and show how, given an arbitrary program written in any imperative language, we may build a declarative ``probabilistic'' agent program on top of it which supports decision making in the presence of uncertainty. We provide two alternative semantics for probabilistic agent programs. We show that the second semantics, though more epistemically appealing, is more complex to compute. We provide sound and complete algorithms to compute the semantics of \emph{positive} agent programs.</p></details> | <details><summary>44 pa...</summary><p>44 pages, 1 figure, Appendix</p></details> |

| **[The Real Barrier to LLM Agent Usability is Agentic ROI](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.17767v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM) agents represent a promising shift in human-AI interaction, moving beyond passive prompt-response systems to autonomous agents capable of reasoning, planning, and goal-directed action. Despite the widespread application in specialized, high-effort tasks like coding and scientific research, we highlight a critical usability gap in high-demand, mass-market applications. This position paper argues that the limited real-world adoption of LLM agents stems not only from gaps in model capabilities, but also from a fundamental tradeoff between the value an agent can provide and the costs incurred during real-world use. Hence, we call for a shift from solely optimizing model performance to a broader, utility-driven perspective: evaluating agents through the lens of the overall agentic return on investment (Agent ROI). By identifying key factors that determine Agentic ROI--information quality, agent time, and cost--we posit a zigzag development trajectory in optimizing agentic ROI: first scaling up to improve the information quality, then scaling down to minimize the time and cost. We outline the roadmap across different development stages to bridge the current usability gaps, aiming to make LLM agents truly scalable, accessible, and effective in real-world contexts.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Agentic Economy](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15799v2)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative AI has transformed human-computer interaction by enabling natural language interfaces and the emergence of autonomous agents capable of acting on users' behalf. While early applications have improved individual productivity, these gains have largely been confined to predefined tasks within existing workflows. We argue that the more profound economic impact lies in reducing communication frictions between consumers and businesses. This shift could reorganize markets, redistribute power, and catalyze the creation of new products and services. We explore the implications of an agentic economy, where assistant agents act on behalf of consumers and service agents represent businesses, interacting programmatically to facilitate transactions. A key distinction we draw is between unscripted interactions -- enabled by technical advances in natural language and protocol design -- and unrestricted interactions, which depend on market structures and governance. We examine the current limitations of siloed and end-to-end agents, and explore future scenarios shaped by technical standards and market dynamics. These include the potential tension between agentic walled gardens and an open web of agents, implications for advertising and discovery, the evolution of micro-transactions, and the unbundling and rebundling of digital goods. Ultimately, we argue that the architecture of agentic communication will determine the extent to which generative AI democratizes access to economic opportunity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Agent+P: Guiding UI Agents via Symbolic Planning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.06042v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM)-based UI agents show great promise for UI automation but often hallucinate in long-horizon tasks due to their lack of understanding of the global UI transition structure. To address this, we introduce AGENT+P, a novel framework that leverages symbolic planning to guide LLM-based UI agents. Specifically, we model an app's UI transition structure as a UI Transition Graph (UTG), which allows us to reformulate the UI automation task as a pathfinding problem on the UTG. This further enables an off-the-shelf symbolic planner to generate a provably correct and optimal high-level plan, preventing the agent from redundant exploration and guiding the agent to achieve the automation goals. AGENT+P is designed as a plug-and-play framework to enhance existing UI agents. Evaluation on the AndroidWorld benchmark demonstrates that AGENT+P improves the success rates of state-of-the-art UI agents by up to 14% and reduces the action steps by 37.7%.</p></details> |  |

While LLMs are designed to understand and generate text like a human, autonomous agents that utilize LLMs as their "brain" have exhibited capabilities beyond text processing such as planning, reflection, and using tools by enabling their "bodies" to interact with the environment. We introduce a simulacrum of hospital called Agent Hospital that simulates the entire process of treating illness, in which all patients, nurses, and doctors are LLM-powered autonomous agents. Within the simulacrum, doctor agents are able to evolve by treating a large number of patient agents without the need to label training data manually. After treating tens of thousands of patient agents in the simulacrum (human doctors may take several years in the real world), the evolved doctor agents outperform state-of-the-art medical agent methods on the MedQA benchmark comprising US Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) test questions. Our methods of simulacrum construction and agent evolution have the potential in benefiting a broad range of applications beyond medical AI.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mobile Agents Rendezvous in spite of a Malicious Agent](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1410.4772v2)** | 2016-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We examine the problem of rendezvous, i.e., having multiple mobile agents gather in a single node of the network. Unlike previous studies, we need to achieve rendezvous in presence of a very powerful adversary, a malicious agent that moves through the network and tries to block the honest agents and prevents them from gathering. The malicious agent is assumed to be arbitrarily fast, has full knowledge of the network and it cannot be exterminated by the honest agents. On the other hand, the honest agents are assumed to be quite weak: They are asynchronous and anonymous, they have only finite memory, they have no prior knowledge of the network and they can communicate with the other agents only when they meet at a node. Can the honest agents achieve rendezvous starting from an arbitrary configuration in spite of the malicious agent? We present some necessary conditions for solving rendezvous in spite of the malicious agent in arbitrary networks. We then focus on the ring and mesh topologies and provide algorithms to solve rendezvous. For ring networks, our algorithms solve rendezvous in all feasible instances of the problem, while we show that rendezvous is impossible for an even number of agents in unoriented rings. For the oriented mesh networks, we prove that the problem can be solved when the honest agents initially form a connected configuration without holes if and only if they can see which are the occupied nodes within a two-hops distance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to study such a powerful and mobile fault model, in the context of mobile agents. Our model lies between the more powerful but static fault model of black holes (which can even destroy the agents), and the less powerful but mobile fault model of Byzantine agents (which can only imitate the honest agents but can neither harm nor stop them).</p></details> |  |
| **[Agents Are Not Enough](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.16241v1)** | 2024-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the midst of the growing integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into various aspects of our lives, agents are experiencing a resurgence. These autonomous programs that act on behalf of humans are neither new nor exclusive to the mainstream AI movement. By exploring past incarnations of agents, we can understand what has been done previously, what worked, and more importantly, what did not pan out and why. This understanding lets us to examine what distinguishes the current focus on agents. While generative AI is appealing, this technology alone is insufficient to make new generations of agents more successful. To make the current wave of agents effective and sustainable, we envision an ecosystem that includes not only agents but also Sims, which represent user preferences and behaviors, as well as Assistants, which directly interact with the user and coordinate the execution of user tasks with the help of the agents.</p></details> |  |

Companies such as OpenAI, Google, Microsoft, and Salesforce promise their AI Agents will go from generating passive text to executing tasks. Instead of a travel itinerary, an AI Agent would book all aspects of your trip. Instead of generating text or images for social media post, an AI Agent would post the content across a host of social media outlets. The potential power of AI Agents has fueled legal scholars' fears that AI Agents will enable rogue commerce, human manipulation, rampant defamation, and intellectual property harms. These scholars are calling for regulation before AI Agents cause havoc. This Article addresses the concerns around AI Agents head on. It shows that core aspects of how one piece of software interacts with another creates ways to discipline AI Agents so that rogue, undesired actions are unlikely, perhaps more so than rules designed to govern human agents. It also develops a way to leverage the computer-science approach to value-alignment to improve a user's ability to take action to prevent or correct AI Agent operations. That approach offers and added benefit of helping AI Agents align with norms around user-AI Agent interactions. These practices will enable desired economic outcomes and mitigate perceived risks. The Article also argues that no matter how much AI Agents seem like human agents, they need not, and should not, be given legal personhood status. In short, humans are responsible for AI Agents' actions, and this Article provides a guide for how humans can build and maintain responsible AI Agents.</p></details> |  |

In open-ended settings, optimizing collaboration for efficiency and effectiveness demands flexible adjustments. Despite this, current research mainly emphasizes fixed, task-oriented workflows and overlooks agent-centric organizational structures. Drawing inspiration from human organizational behavior, we introduce a self-organizing agent system (S-Agents) with a "tree of agents" structure for dynamic workflow, an "hourglass agent architecture" for balancing information priorities, and a "non-obstructive collaboration" method to allow asynchronous task execution among agents. This structure can autonomously coordinate a group of agents, efficiently addressing the challenges of open and dynamic environments without human intervention. Our experiments demonstrate that S-Agents proficiently execute collaborative building tasks and resource collection in the Minecraft environment, validating their effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2024 Workshop on Large Language Model (LLM) Agents</p></details> |

Current massive-agent ecosystems face growing challenges, including impersonal service experiences, a lack of standardization, and untrustworthy behavior. To address these issues, we propose ColorEcosystem, a novel blueprint designed to enable personalized, standardized, and trustworthy agentic service at scale. Concretely, ColorEcosystem consists of three key components: agent carrier, agent store, and agent audit. The agent carrier provides personalized service experiences by utilizing user-specific data and creating a digital twin, while the agent store serves as a centralized, standardized platform for managing diverse agentic services. The agent audit, based on the supervision of developer and user activities, ensures the integrity and credibility of both service providers and users. Through the analysis of challenges, transitional forms, and practical considerations, the ColorEcosystem is poised to power personalized, standardized, and trustworthy agentic service across massive-agent ecosystems. Meanwhile, we have also implemented part of ColorEcosystem's functionality, and the relevant code is open-sourced at https://github.com/opas-lab/color-ecosystem.</p></details> |  |

However, their practical deployment is often limited by their low success rates under complex real-world environments. To tackle this, prior research has primarily focused on improving the agents themselves, such as developing strong agentic LLMs, while overlooking the role of the system environment in which the agent operates. In this paper, we study a complementary direction: improving agent success rates by optimizing the system environment in which the agent operates. We collect 142 agent traces (3,656 turns of agent-environment interactions) across 5 state-of-the-art agentic benchmarks. By analyzing these agent failures, we propose a taxonomy for agent-environment interaction failures that includes 6 failure modes. Guided by these findings, we design Aegis, a set of targeted environment optimizations: 1) environment observability enhancement, 2) common computation offloading, and 3) speculative agentic actions. These techniques improve agent success rates on average by 6.7-12.5%, without any modifications to the agent and underlying LLM.</p></details> |  |

In contrast, a sequential scheme that updates policies agent-by-agent provides another perspective and shows strong performance. However, sample inefficiency and lack of monotonic improvement guarantees for each agent are still the two significant challenges for the sequential scheme. In this paper, we propose the \textbf{A}gent-by-\textbf{a}gent \textbf{P}olicy \textbf{O}ptimization (A2PO) algorithm to improve the sample efficiency and retain the guarantees of monotonic improvement for each agent during training. We justify the tightness of the monotonic improvement bound compared with other trust region algorithms. From the perspective of sequentially updating agents, we further consider the effect of agent updating order and extend the theory of non-stationarity into the sequential update scheme. To evaluate A2PO, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study on four benchmarks: StarCraftII, Multi-agent MuJoCo, Multi-agent Particle Environment, and Google Research Football full game scenarios. A2PO consistently outperforms strong baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR2023, https://openreview.net/forum?id=Q-neeWNVv1</p></details> |
| **[Agent-SafetyBench: Evaluating the Safety of LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.14470v2)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as agents, their integration into interactive environments and tool use introduce new safety challenges beyond those associated with the models themselves. However, the absence of comprehensive benchmarks for evaluating agent safety presents a significant barrier to effective assessment and further improvement. In this paper, we introduce Agent-SafetyBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the safety of LLM agents. Agent-SafetyBench encompasses 349 interaction environments and 2,000 test cases, evaluating 8 categories of safety risks and covering 10 common failure modes frequently encountered in unsafe interactions. Our evaluation of 16 popular LLM agents reveals a concerning result: none of the agents achieves a safety score above 60%. This highlights significant safety challenges in LLM agents and underscores the considerable need for improvement. Through failure mode and helpfulness analysis, we summarize two fundamental safety defects in current LLM agents: lack of robustness and lack of risk awareness. Furthermore, our findings suggest that reliance on defense prompts alone may be insufficient to address these safety issues, emphasizing the need for more advanced and robust strategies. To drive progress in this area, Agent-SafetyBench has been released at https://github.com/thu-coai/Agent-SafetyBench/ to facilitate further research in agent safety evaluation and improvement.</p></details> | 26 pages |
| **[Infrastructure for AI Agents](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.10114v3)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI agents plan and execute interactions in open-ended environments. For example, OpenAI's Operator can use a web browser to do product comparisons and buy online goods. Much research on making agents useful and safe focuses on directly modifying their behaviour, such as by training them to follow user instructions. Direct behavioural modifications are useful, but do not fully address how heterogeneous agents will interact with each other and other actors. Rather, we will need external protocols and systems to shape such interactions. For instance, agents will need more efficient protocols to communicate with each other and form agreements. Attributing an agent's actions to a particular human or other legal entity can help to establish trust, and also disincentivize misuse. Given this motivation, we propose the concept of \textbf{agent infrastructure}: technical systems and shared protocols external to agents that are designed to mediate and influence their interactions with and impacts on their environments. Just as the Internet relies on protocols like HTTPS, our work argues that agent infrastructure will be similarly indispensable to ecosystems of agents. We identify three functions for agent infrastructure: 1) attributing actions, properties, and other information to specific agents, their users, or other actors; 2) shaping agents' interactions; and 3) detecting and remedying harmful actions from agents. We provide an incomplete catalog of research directions for such functions. For each direction, we include analysis of use cases, infrastructure adoption, relationships to existing (internet) infrastructure, limitations, and open questions. Making progress on agent infrastructure can prepare society for the adoption of more advanced agents.</p></details> | Accepted to TMLR |
| **[A3: Android Agent Arena for Mobile GUI Agents](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.01149v2)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI agents have become increasingly prevalent in recent years, driven by significant advancements in the field of large language models (LLMs). Mobile GUI agents, a subset of AI agents, are designed to autonomously perform tasks on mobile devices. While numerous studies have introduced agents, datasets, and benchmarks to advance mobile GUI agent research, many existing datasets focus on static frame evaluations and fail to provide a comprehensive platform for assessing performance on real-world, in-the-wild tasks. To address this gap, we present Android Agent Arena (A3), a novel evaluation platform. Unlike existing in-the-wild systems, A3 offers: (1) meaningful and practical tasks, such as real-time online information retrieval and operational instructions; (2) a larger, more flexible action space, enabling compatibility with agents trained on any dataset; and (3) automated business-level LLM-based evaluation process. A3 includes 21 widely used general third-party apps and 201 tasks representative of common user scenarios, providing a robust foundation for evaluating mobile GUI agents in real-world situations and a new autonomous evaluation process for less human labor and coding expertise. The project is available at https://yuxiangchai.github.io/Android-Agent-Arena/.</p></details> |  |

Evaluating these systems is challenging, as their rapid evolution outpaces traditional human evaluation. Researchers have proposed LLM Agents to simulate participants as digital twins, but it remains unclear to what extent a digital twin can represent a specific customer in multi-turn interaction with an agentic AI system. In this paper, we recruited 40 human participants to shop with Amazon Rufus, collected their personas, interaction traces, and UX feedback, and then created digital twins to repeat the task. Pairwise comparison of human and digital-twin traces shows that while agents often explored more diverse choices, their action patterns aligned with humans and yielded similar design feedback. This study is the first to quantify how closely LLM agents can mirror human multi-turn interaction with an agentic AI system, highlighting their potential for scalable evaluation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Agentic JWT: A Secure Delegation Protocol for Autonomous AI Agents](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.13597v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous LLM agents can issue thousands of API calls per hour without human oversight. OAuth 2.0 assumes deterministic clients, but in agentic settings stochastic reasoning, prompt injection, or multi-agent orchestration can silently expand privileges. We introduce Agentic JWT (A-JWT), a dual-faceted intent token that binds each agent's action to verifiable user intent and, optionally, to a specific workflow step. A-JWT carries an agent's identity as a one-way checksum hash derived from its prompt, tools and configuration, and a chained delegation assertion to prove which downstream agent may execute a given task, and per-agent proof-of-possession keys to prevent replay and in-process impersonation. We define a new authorization mechanism and add a lightweight client shim library that self-verifies code at run time, mints intent tokens, tracks workflow steps and derives keys, thus enabling secure agent identity and separation even within a single process. We illustrate a comprehensive threat model for agentic applications, implement a Python proof-of-concept and show functional blocking of scope-violating requests, replay, impersonation, and prompt-injection pathways with sub-millisecond overhead on commodity hardware. The design aligns with ongoing OAuth agent discussions and offers a drop-in path toward zero-trust guarantees for agentic applications. A comprehensive performance and security evaluation with experimental results will appear in our forthcoming journal publication</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 6 figures, 2 Tables</p></details> |
| **[Group-Agent Reinforcement Learning with Heterogeneous Agents](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.11818v2)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Group-agent reinforcement learning (GARL) is a newly arising learning scenario, where multiple reinforcement learning agents study together in a group, sharing knowledge in an asynchronous fashion. The goal is to improve the learning performance of each individual agent. Under a more general heterogeneous setting where different agents learn using different algorithms, we advance GARL by designing novel and effective group-learning mechanisms. They guide the agents on whether and how to learn from action choices from the others, and allow the agents to adopt available policy and value function models sent by another agent if they perform better. We have conducted extensive experiments on a total of 43 different Atari 2600 games to demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method. After the group learning, among the 129 agents examined, 96% are able to achieve a learning speed-up, and 72% are able to learn over 100 times faster. Also, around 41% of those agents have achieved a higher accumulated reward score by learning in less than 5% of the time steps required by a single agent when learning on its own.</p></details> |  |
| **[Internet of Agents: Weaving a Web of Heterogeneous Agents for Collaborative Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.07061v2)** | 2024-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has paved the way for the development of highly capable autonomous agents. However, existing multi-agent frameworks often struggle with integrating diverse capable third-party agents due to reliance on agents defined within their own ecosystems. They also face challenges in simulating distributed environments, as most frameworks are limited to single-device setups. Furthermore, these frameworks often rely on hard-coded communication pipelines, limiting their adaptability to dynamic task requirements. Inspired by the concept of the Internet, we propose the Internet of Agents (IoA), a novel framework that addresses these limitations by providing a flexible and scalable platform for LLM-based multi-agent collaboration. IoA introduces an agent integration protocol, an instant-messaging-like architecture design, and dynamic mechanisms for agent teaming and conversation flow control. Through extensive experiments on general assistant tasks, embodied AI tasks, and retrieval-augmented generation benchmarks, we demonstrate that IoA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, showcasing its ability to facilitate effective collaboration among heterogeneous agents. IoA represents a step towards linking diverse agents in an Internet-like environment, where agents can seamlessly collaborate to achieve greater intelligence and capabilities. Our codebase has been released at \url{https://github.com/OpenBMB/IoA}.</p></details> | work in progress |

A better understanding of agents by people will help to improve the problems caused by the future use of agents in society. In the past, there has been a focus on the importance of self-disclosure and the relationship between agents and humans in their interactions. In this study, we focused on the attributes of self-disclosure and the relationship between agents and people. An experiment was conducted to investigate hypotheses on trust and empathy with agents through six attributes of self-disclosure (opinions and attitudes, hobbies, work, money, personality, and body) and through competitive and cooperative relationships before a robotic agent performs a joint task. The experiment consisted of two between-participant factors: six levels of self-disclosure attributes and two levels of relationship with the agent. The results showed that the two factors had no effect on trust in the agent, but there was statistical significance for the attribute of self-disclosure regarding a person's empathy toward the agent. In addition, statistical significance was found regarding the agent's ability to empathize with a person as perceived by the person only in the case where the type of relationship, competitive or cooperative, was presented. The results of this study could lead to an effective method for building relationships with agents, which are increasingly used in society.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, 4 tables, submitted RO-MAN2024. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2306.09447</p></details> |

While existing methods build instruction-following agents that can perform diverse open-ended tasks, none of them demonstrates creativity -- the ability to give novel and diverse task solutions implicit in the language instructions. This limitation comes from their inability to convert abstract language instructions into concrete task goals in the environment and perform long-horizon planning for such complicated goals. Given the observation that humans perform creative tasks with the help of imagination, we propose a class of solutions for creative agents, where the controller is enhanced with an imaginator that generates detailed imaginations of task outcomes conditioned on language instructions. We introduce several approaches to implementing the components of creative agents. We implement the imaginator with either a large language model for textual imagination or a diffusion model for visual imagination. The controller can either be a behavior-cloning policy learned from data or a pre-trained foundation model generating executable codes in the environment. We benchmark creative tasks with the challenging open-world game Minecraft, where the agents are asked to create diverse buildings given free-form language instructions. In addition, we propose novel evaluation metrics for open-ended creative tasks utilizing GPT-4V, which holds many advantages over existing metrics. We perform a detailed experimental analysis of creative agents, showing that creative agents are the first AI agents accomplishing diverse building creation in the survival mode of Minecraft. Our benchmark and models are open-source for future research on creative agents (https://github.com/PKU-RL/Creative-Agents).</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first two authors contribute equally</p></details> |
| **[TAPE: Leveraging Agent Topology for Cooperative Multi-Agent Policy Gradient](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.15667v3)** | 2024-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-Agent Policy Gradient (MAPG) has made significant progress in recent years. However, centralized critics in state-of-the-art MAPG methods still face the centralized-decentralized mismatch (CDM) issue, which means sub-optimal actions by some agents will affect other agent's policy learning. While using individual critics for policy updates can avoid this issue, they severely limit cooperation among agents. To address this issue, we propose an agent topology framework, which decides whether other agents should be considered in policy gradient and achieves compromise between facilitating cooperation and alleviating the CDM issue. The agent topology allows agents to use coalition utility as learning objective instead of global utility by centralized critics or local utility by individual critics. To constitute the agent topology, various models are studied. We propose Topology-based multi-Agent Policy gradiEnt (TAPE) for both stochastic and deterministic MAPG methods. We prove the policy improvement theorem for stochastic TAPE and give a theoretical explanation for the improved cooperation among agents. Experiment results on several benchmarks show the agent topology is able to facilitate agent cooperation and alleviate CDM issue respectively to improve performance of TAPE. Finally, multiple ablation studies and a heuristic graph search algorithm are devised to show the efficacy of the agent topology.</p></details> |  |
| **[Non-cooperative Multi-agent Systems with Exploring Agents](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.12360v1)** | 2020-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent learning is a challenging problem in machine learning that has applications in different domains such as distributed control, robotics, and economics. We develop a prescriptive model of multi-agent behavior using Markov games. Since in many multi-agent systems, agents do not necessary select their optimum strategies against other agents (e.g., multi-pedestrian interaction), we focus on models in which the agents play "exploration but near optimum strategies". We model such policies using the Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution. This leads to a set of coupled Bellman equations that describes the behavior of the agents. We introduce a set of conditions under which the set of equations admit a unique solution and propose two algorithms that provably provide the solution in finite and infinite time horizon scenarios. We also study a practical setting in which the interactions can be described using the occupancy measures and propose a simplified Markov game with less complexity. Furthermore, we establish the connection between the Markov games with exploration strategies and the principle of maximum causal entropy for multi-agent systems. Finally, we evaluate the performance of our algorithms via several well-known games from the literature and some games that are designed based on real world applications.</p></details> |  |

This work presents the first systematic study of the efficiency-effectiveness trade-off in modern agent systems, addressing the critical need for cost-effective designs without sacrificing performance. We investigate three key questions: (1) How much complexity do agentic tasks inherently require? (2) When do additional modules yield diminishing returns? (3) How much efficiency can be gained through the design of efficient agent frameworks? Through an empirical analysis on the GAIA benchmark, we evaluate the impact of LLM backbone selection, agent framework designs, and test-time scaling strategies. Using the cost-of-pass metric, we quantify the efficiency-performance trade-off across these dimensions. Our findings inform the development of Efficient Agents , a novel agent framework that has an optimal complexity to task requirements. Efficient Agents retains 96.7% of the performance of OWL, one leading open-source agent framework, while reducing operational costs from $0.398 to $0.228, resulting in a 28.4% improvement in cost-of-pass. Our work provides actionable insights for designing efficient, high-performing agent systems, advancing the accessibility and sustainability of AI-driven solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Work ...</summary><p>Work in progress.

This review presents a structured analysis of Trust, Risk, and Security Management (TRiSM) in the context of LLM-based Agentic Multi-Agent Systems (AMAS). We begin by examining the conceptual foundations of Agentic AI and highlight its architectural distinctions from traditional AI agents. We then adapt and extend the AI TRiSM framework for Agentic AI, structured around key pillars: \textit{ Explainability, ModelOps, Security, Privacy} and \textit{their Lifecycle Governance}, each contextualized to the challenges of AMAS. A risk taxonomy is proposed to capture the unique threats and vulnerabilities of Agentic AI, ranging from coordination failures to prompt-based adversarial manipulation. To support practical assessment in Agentic AI works, we introduce two novel metrics: the Component Synergy Score (CSS), which quantifies the quality of inter-agent collaboration, and the Tool Utilization Efficacy (TUE), which evaluates the efficiency of tool use within agent workflows. We further discuss strategies for improving explainability in Agentic AI, as well as approaches to enhancing security and privacy through encryption, adversarial robustness, and regulatory compliance. The review concludes with a research roadmap for the responsible development and deployment of Agentic AI, highlighting key directions to align emerging systems with TRiSM principles-ensuring safety, transparency, and accountability in their operation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Delegating to Multiple Agents](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.03203v2)** | 2023-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider a multi-agent delegation mechanism without money. In our model, given a set of agents, each agent has a fixed number of solutions which is exogenous to the mechanism, and privately sends a signal, e.g., a subset of solutions, to the principal. Then, the principal selects a final solution based on the agents' signals. In stark contrast to single-agent setting by Kleinberg and Kleinberg (EC'18) with an approximate Bayesian mechanism, we show that there exists efficient approximate prior-independent mechanisms with both information and performance gain, thanks to the competitive tension between the agents. Interestingly, however, the amount of such a compelling power significantly varies with respect to the information available to the agents, and the degree of correlation between the principal's and the agent's utility. Technically, we conduct a comprehensive study on the multi-agent delegation problem and derive several results on the approximation factors of Bayesian/prior-independent mechanisms in complete/incomplete information settings. As a special case of independent interest, we obtain comparative statics regarding the number of agents which implies the dominance of the multi-agent setting ($n \ge 2$) over the single-agent setting ($n=1$) in terms of the principal's utility. We further extend our problem by considering an examination cost of the mechanism and derive some analogous results in the complete information setting.</p></details> |  |

The Internet of Agents (IoA) aims to interconnect heterogeneous agents through standardized communication protocols, enabling seamless collaboration and intelligent task execution. However, existing agent communication protocols such as MCP, A2A, and ANP remain fragmented and scenario-specific. To address this gap, we propose Agent Collaboration Protocols (ACPs), a comprehensive protocol suite for the IoA. ACPs include registration, discovery, interaction, and tooling protocols to support trustable access, capability orchestration, and workflow construction. We present the architecture, key technologies, and application workflows of ACPs, and demonstrate its effectiveness in a collaborative restaurant booking scenario. ACPs lay the foundation for building a secure, open, and scalable agent internet infrastructure.</p></details> | 7 pages, 8 figures |

These AI-powered systems function as autonomous teammates capable of planning and executing complex development tasks. Agents have become active participants in refactoring, a cornerstone of sustainable software development aimed at improving internal code quality without altering observable behavior. Despite their increasing adoption, there is a critical lack of empirical understanding regarding how agentic refactoring is utilized in practice, how it compares to human-driven refactoring, and what impact it has on code quality. To address this empirical gap, we present a large-scale study of AI agent-generated refactorings in real-world open-source Java projects, analyzing 15,451 refactoring instances across 12,256 pull requests and 14,988 commits derived from the AIDev dataset. Our empirical analysis shows that refactoring is a common and intentional activity in this development paradigm, with agents explicitly targeting refactoring in 26.1% of commits. Analysis of refactoring types reveals that agentic efforts are dominated by low-level, consistency-oriented edits, such as Change Variable Type (11.8%), Rename Parameter (10.4%), and Rename Variable (8.5%), reflecting a preference for localized improvements over the high-level design changes common in human refactoring. Additionally, the motivations behind agentic refactoring focus overwhelmingly on internal quality concerns, with maintainability (52.5%) and readability (28.1%). Furthermore, quantitative evaluation of code quality metrics shows that agentic refactoring yields small but statistically significant improvements in structural metrics, particularly for medium-level changes, reducing class size and complexity (e.g., Class LOC median $Δ$ = -15.25).</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 7 Tables, 5 Figuress, Submitted to ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology(TOSEM)</p></details> |
| **[Agentic Markets: Game Dynamics and Equilibrium in Markets with Learning Agents](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.18571v1)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous and learning agents increasingly participate in markets - setting prices, placing bids, ordering inventory. Such agents are not just aiming to optimize in an uncertain environment; they are making decisions in a game-theoretical environment where the decision of one agent influences the profit of other agents. While game theory usually predicts outcomes of strategic interaction as an equilibrium, it does not capture how repeated interaction of learning agents arrives at a certain outcome. This article surveys developments in modeling agent behavior as dynamical systems, with a focus on projected gradient and no-regret learning algorithms. In general, learning in games can lead to all types of dynamics, including convergence to equilibrium, but also cycles and chaotic behavior. It is important to understand when we can expect efficient equilibrium in automated markets and when this is not the case. Thus, we analyze when and how learning agents converge to an equilibrium of a market game, drawing on tools from variational inequalities and Lyapunov stability theory. Special attention is given to the stability of projected dynamics and the convergence to equilibrium sets as limiting outcomes. Overall, the paper provides mathematical foundations for analyzing stability and convergence in agentic markets driven by autonomous, learning agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[Transferable Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with Dynamic Participating Agents](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.02424v1)** | 2022-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) with centralized training and decentralized execution. During the training, new agents may join, and existing agents may unexpectedly leave the training. In such situations, a standard deep MARL model must be trained again from scratch, which is very time-consuming. To tackle this problem, we propose a special network architecture with a few-shot learning algorithm that allows the number of agents to vary during centralized training. In particular, when a new agent joins the centralized training, our few-shot learning algorithm trains its policy network and value network using a small number of samples; when an agent leaves the training, the training process of the remaining agents is not affected. Our experiments show that using the proposed network architecture and algorithm, model adaptation when new agents join can be 100+ times faster than the baseline. Our work is applicable to any setting, including cooperative, competitive, and mixed.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures |

Given the stochastic nature of generative AI-based agents, their effective and safe deployment in organizations requires robust governance, which can be facilitated by agentic business process management. However, given the nascence of this new-generation agent notion, it is not clear what BPM practitioners consider to be an agent, and what benefits, risks and governance challenges they associate with agent deployments. To investigate how organizations can effectively govern AI agents, we conducted a qualitative study involving semi-structured interviews with 22 BPM practitioners from diverse industries. They anticipate that agents will enhance efficiency, improve data quality, ensure better compliance, and boost scalability through automation, while also cautioning against risks such as bias, over-reliance, cybersecurity threats, job displacement, and ambiguous decision-making. To address these challenges, the study presents six key recommendations for the responsible adoption of AI agents: define clear business goals, set legal and ethical guardrails, establish human-agent collaboration, customize agent behavior, manage risks, and ensure safe integration with fallback options. Additionally, the paper outlines actions to align traditional BPM with agentic AI, including balancing human and agent roles, redefining human involvement, adapting process structures, and introducing performance metrics. These insights provide a practical foundation for integrating AI agents into business processes while preserving oversight, flexibility, and trust.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for Responsible BPM 2025, 15 pages including references</p></details> |

A previous theoretical study has argued that this remarkable performance is because the meta-training protocol incentivises agents to behave Bayes-optimally. We empirically investigate this claim on a number of prediction and bandit tasks. Inspired by ideas from theoretical computer science, we show that meta-learned and Bayes-optimal agents not only behave alike, but they even share a similar computational structure, in the sense that one agent system can approximately simulate the other. Furthermore, we show that Bayes-optimal agents are fixed points of the meta-learning dynamics. Our results suggest that memory-based meta-learning might serve as a general technique for numerically approximating Bayes-optimal agents - that is, even for task distributions for which we currently don't possess tractable models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at 34th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2020), Vancouver, Canada</p></details> |
| **[Malicious Agent Detection for Robust Multi-Agent Collaborative Perception](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.11901v2)** | 2024-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, multi-agent collaborative (MAC) perception has been proposed and outperformed the traditional single-agent perception in many applications, such as autonomous driving. However, MAC perception is more vulnerable to adversarial attacks than single-agent perception due to the information exchange. The attacker can easily degrade the performance of a victim agent by sending harmful information from a malicious agent nearby. In this paper, we extend adversarial attacks to an important perception task -- MAC object detection, where generic defenses such as adversarial training are no longer effective against these attacks. More importantly, we propose Malicious Agent Detection (MADE), a reactive defense specific to MAC perception that can be deployed by each agent to accurately detect and then remove any potential malicious agent in its local collaboration network. In particular, MADE inspects each agent in the network independently using a semi-supervised anomaly detector based on a double-hypothesis test with the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure to control the false positive rate of the inference. For the two hypothesis tests, we propose a match loss statistic and a collaborative reconstruction loss statistic, respectively, both based on the consistency between the agent to be inspected and the ego agent where our detector is deployed. We conduct comprehensive evaluations on a benchmark 3D dataset V2X-sim and a real-road dataset DAIR-V2X and show that with the protection of MADE, the drops in the average precision compared with the best-case "oracle" defender against our attack are merely 1.28% and 0.34%, respectively, much lower than 8.92% and 10.00% for adversarial training, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IROS 2024</p></details> |

But AI agent evaluations suffer from many challenges that undermine our understanding of how well agents really work. We introduce the Holistic Agent Leaderboard (HAL) to address these challenges. We make three main contributions. First, we provide a standardized evaluation harness that orchestrates parallel evaluations across hundreds of VMs, reducing evaluation time from weeks to hours while eliminating common implementation bugs. Second, we conduct three-dimensional analysis spanning models, scaffolds, and benchmarks. We validate the harness by conducting 21,730 agent rollouts across 9 models and 9 benchmarks in coding, web navigation, science, and customer service with a total cost of about $40,000. Our analysis reveals surprising insights, such as higher reasoning effort reducing accuracy in the majority of runs. Third, we use LLM-aided log inspection to uncover previously unreported behaviors, such as searching for the benchmark on HuggingFace instead of solving a task, or misusing credit cards in flight booking tasks. We share all agent logs, comprising 2.5B tokens of language model calls, to incentivize further research into agent behavior. By standardizing how the field evaluates agents and addressing common pitfalls in agent evaluation, we hope to shift the focus from agents that ace benchmarks to agents that work reliably in the real world.</p></details> |  |
| **[Subjective Knowledge and Reasoning about Agents in Multi-Agent Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.08016v1)** | 2020-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Though a lot of work in multi-agent systems is focused on reasoning about knowledge and beliefs of artificial agents, an explicit representation and reasoning about the presence/absence of agents, especially in the scenarios where agents may be unaware of other agents joining in or going offline in a multi-agent system, leading to partial knowledge/asymmetric knowledge of the agents is mostly overlooked by the MAS community. Such scenarios lay the foundations of cases where an agent can influence other agents' mental states by (mis)informing them about the presence/absence of collaborators or adversaries. In this paper, we investigate how Kripke structure-based epistemic models can be extended to express the above notion based on an agent's subjective knowledge and we discuss the challenges that come along.</p></details> |  |

It provides an example-based walk-through of how to implement abstractions for reasoning loop agents in vanilla JavaScript. The initial example is used as a stepping stone for explaining how to implement slightly more advanced agents and multi-agent systems using JS-son, a JavaScript library for agent-oriented programming.

| **[Are Agents Just Automata? On the Formal Equivalence Between Agentic AI and the Chomsky Hierarchy](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.23487v1)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper establishes a formal equivalence between the architectural classes of modern agentic AI systems and the abstract machines of the Chomsky hierarchy. We posit that the memory architecture of an AI agent is the definitive feature determining its computational power and that it directly maps it to a corresponding class of automaton. Specifically, we demonstrate that simple reflex agents are equivalent to Finite Automata, hierarchical task-decomposition agents are equivalent to Pushdown Automata, and agents employing readable/writable memory for reflection are equivalent to TMs. This Automata-Agent Framework provides a principled methodology for right-sizing agent architectures to optimize computational efficiency and cost. More critically, it creates a direct pathway to formal verification, enables the application of mature techniques from automata theory to guarantee agent safety and predictability. By classifying agents, we can formally delineate the boundary between verifiable systems and those whose behavior is fundamentally undecidable. We address the inherent probabilistic nature of LLM-based agents by extending the framework to probabilistic automata that allow quantitative risk analysis. The paper concludes by outlining an agenda for developing static analysis tools and grammars for agentic frameworks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Risk-Sensitive Agent Compositions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.04632v2)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>From software development to robot control, modern agentic systems decompose complex objectives into a sequence of subtasks and choose a set of specialized AI agents to complete them. We formalize agentic workflows as directed acyclic graphs, called agent graphs, where edges represent AI agents and paths correspond to feasible compositions of agents. Real-world deployment requires selecting agent compositions that not only maximize task success but also minimize violations of safety, fairness, and privacy requirements which demands a careful analysis of the low-probability (tail) behaviors of compositions of agents. In this work, we consider risk minimization over the set of feasible agent compositions and seek to minimize the value-at-risk of the loss distribution of the agent composition where the loss quantifies violations of these requirements. We introduce an efficient algorithm which traverses the agent graph and finds a near-optimal composition of agents. It uses a dynamic programming approach to approximate the value-at-risk of agent compositions by exploiting a union bound. Furthermore, we prove that the approximation is near-optimal asymptotically for a broad class of practical loss functions. To evaluate our framework, we consider a suite of video game-like control benchmarks that require composing several agents trained with reinforcement learning and demonstrate our algorithm's effectiveness in approximating the value-at-risk and identifying the optimal agent composition.</p></details> | 17 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Agent-OM: Leveraging LLM Agents for Ontology Matching](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.00326v20)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ontology matching (OM) enables semantic interoperability between different ontologies and resolves their conceptual heterogeneity by aligning related entities. OM systems currently have two prevailing design paradigms: conventional knowledge-based expert systems and newer machine learning-based predictive systems. While large language models (LLMs) and LLM agents have revolutionised data engineering and have been applied creatively in many domains, their potential for OM remains underexplored. This study introduces a novel agent-powered LLM-based design paradigm for OM systems. With consideration of several specific challenges in leveraging LLM agents for OM, we propose a generic framework, namely Agent-OM (Agent for Ontology Matching), consisting of two Siamese agents for retrieval and matching, with a set of OM tools. Our framework is implemented in a proof-of-concept system. Evaluations of three Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI) tracks over state-of-the-art OM systems show that our system can achieve results very close to the long-standing best performance on simple OM tasks and can significantly improve the performance on complex and few-shot OM tasks.</p></details> | 31 pages |
| **[Backpropagation Through Agents](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.12574v1)** | 2024-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A fundamental challenge in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is to learn the joint policy in an extremely large search space, which grows exponentially with the number of agents. Moreover, fully decentralized policy factorization significantly restricts the search space, which may lead to sub-optimal policies. In contrast, the auto-regressive joint policy can represent a much richer class of joint policies by factorizing the joint policy into the product of a series of conditional individual policies. While such factorization introduces the action dependency among agents explicitly in sequential execution, it does not take full advantage of the dependency during learning. In particular, the subsequent agents do not give the preceding agents feedback about their decisions. In this paper, we propose a new framework Back-Propagation Through Agents (BPTA) that directly accounts for both agents' own policy updates and the learning of their dependent counterparts. This is achieved by propagating the feedback through action chains. With the proposed framework, our Bidirectional Proximal Policy Optimisation (BPPO) outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. Extensive experiments on matrix games, StarCraftII v2, Multi-agent MuJoCo, and Google Research Football demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |
| **[A survey of agent interoperability protocols: Model Context Protocol (MCP), Agent Communication Protocol (ACP), Agent-to-Agent Protocol (A2A), and Agent Network Protocol (ANP)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.02279v2)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model powered autonomous agents demand robust, standardized protocols to integrate tools, share contextual data, and coordinate tasks across heterogeneous systems. Ad-hoc integrations are difficult to scale, secure, and generalize across domains. This survey examines four emerging agent communication protocols: Model Context Protocol (MCP), Agent Communication Protocol (ACP), Agent-to-Agent Protocol (A2A), and Agent Network Protocol (ANP), each addressing interoperability in deployment contexts. MCP provides a JSON-RPC client-server interface for secure tool invocation and typed data exchange. ACP defines a general-purpose communication protocol over RESTful HTTP, supporting MIME-typed multipart messages and synchronous and asynchronous interactions. Its lightweight and runtime-independent design enables scalable agent invocation, while features like session management, message routing, and integration with role-based and decentralized identifiers (DIDs). A2A enables peer-to-peer task delegation using capability-based Agent Cards, supporting secure and scalable collaboration across enterprise agent workflows. ANP supports open network agent discovery and secure collaboration using W3C decentralized identifiers DIDs and JSON-LD graphs. The protocols are compared across multiple dimensions, including interaction modes, discovery mechanisms, communication patterns, and security models. Based on the comparative analysis, a phased adoption roadmap is proposed: beginning with MCP for tool access, followed by ACP for structured, multimodal messaging session-aware interaction and both online and offline agent discovery across scalable, HTTP-based deployments A2A for collaborative task execution, and extending to ANP for decentralized agent marketplaces. This work provides a comprehensive foundation for designing secure, interoperable, and scalable ecosystems of LLM-powered agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[Security of AI Agents](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.08689v3)** | 2024-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI agents have been boosted by large language models. AI agents can function as intelligent assistants and complete tasks on behalf of their users with access to tools and the ability to execute commands in their environments. Through studying and experiencing the workflow of typical AI agents, we have raised several concerns regarding their security. These potential vulnerabilities are not addressed by the frameworks used to build the agents, nor by research aimed at improving the agents. In this paper, we identify and describe these vulnerabilities in detail from a system security perspective, emphasizing their causes and severe effects. Furthermore, we introduce defense mechanisms corresponding to each vulnerability with design and experiments to evaluate their viability. Altogether, this paper contextualizes the security issues in the current development of AI agents and delineates methods to make AI agents safer and more reliable.</p></details> | <details><summary>updat...</summary><p>updated version with figures</p></details> |
| **[DSDF: An approach to handle stochastic agents in collaborative multi-agent reinforcement learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.06609v1)** | 2021-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-Agent reinforcement learning has received lot of attention in recent years and have applications in many different areas. Existing methods involving Centralized Training and Decentralized execution, attempts to train the agents towards learning a pattern of coordinated actions to arrive at optimal joint policy. However if some agents are stochastic to varying degrees of stochasticity, the above methods often fail to converge and provides poor coordination among agents. In this paper we show how this stochasticity of agents, which could be a result of malfunction or aging of robots, can add to the uncertainty in coordination and there contribute to unsatisfactory global coordination. In this case, the deterministic agents have to understand the behavior and limitations of the stochastic agents while arriving at optimal joint policy. Our solution, DSDF which tunes the discounted factor for the agents according to uncertainty and use the values to update the utility networks of individual agents. DSDF also helps in imparting an extent of reliability in coordination thereby granting stochastic agents tasks which are immediate and of shorter trajectory with deterministic ones taking the tasks which involve longer planning. Such an method enables joint co-ordinations of agents some of which may be partially performing and thereby can reduce or delay the investment of agent/robot replacement in many circumstances. Results on benchmark environment for different scenarios shows the efficacy of the proposed approach when compared with existing approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[The FM Agent](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.26144v1)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are catalyzing the development of autonomous AI research agents for scientific and engineering discovery. We present FM Agent, a novel and general-purpose multi-agent framework that leverages a synergistic combination of LLM-based reasoning and large-scale evolutionary search to address complex real-world challenges. The core of FM Agent integrates several key innovations: 1) a cold-start initialization phase incorporating expert guidance, 2) a novel evolutionary sampling strategy for iterative optimization, 3) domain-specific evaluators that combine correctness, effectiveness, and LLM-supervised feedback, and 4) a distributed, asynchronous execution infrastructure built on Ray. Demonstrating broad applicability, our system has been evaluated across diverse domains, including operations research, machine learning, GPU kernel optimization, and classical mathematical problems. FM Agent reaches state-of-the-art results autonomously, without human interpretation or tuning -- 1976.3 on ALE-Bench (+5.2\%), 43.56\% on MLE-Bench (+4.0pp), up to 20x speedups on KernelBench, and establishes new state-of-the-art(SOTA) results on several classical mathematical problems. Beyond academic benchmarks, FM Agent shows considerable promise for both large-scale enterprise R\&D workflows and fundamental scientific research, where it can accelerate innovation, automate complex discovery processes, and deliver substantial engineering and scientific advances with broader societal impact.</p></details> |  |
| **[The OpenHands Software Agent SDK: A Composable and Extensible Foundation for Production Agents](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.03690v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agents are now used widely in the process of software development, but building production-ready software engineering agents is a complex task. Deploying software agents effectively requires flexibility in implementation and experimentation, reliable and secure execution, and interfaces for users to interact with agents. In this paper, we present the OpenHands Software Agent SDK, a toolkit for implementing software development agents that satisfy these desiderata. This toolkit is a complete architectural redesign of the agent components of the popular OpenHands framework for software development agents, which has 64k+ GitHub stars. To achieve flexibility, we design a simple interface for implementing agents that requires only a few lines of code in the default case, but is easily extensible to more complex, full-featured agents with features such as custom tools, memory management, and more. For security and reliability, it delivers seamless local-to-remote execution portability, integrated REST/WebSocket services. For interaction with human users, it can connect directly to a variety of interfaces, such as visual workspaces (VS Code, VNC, browser), command-line interfaces, and APIs. Compared with existing SDKs from OpenAI, Claude, and Google, OpenHands uniquely integrates native sandboxed execution, lifecycle control, model-agnostic multi-LLM routing, and built-in security analysis. Empirical results on SWE-Bench Verified and GAIA benchmarks demonstrate strong performance. Put together, these elements allow the OpenHands Software Agent SDK to provide a practical foundation for prototyping, unlocking new classes of custom applications, and reliably deploying agents at scale.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Agents are Social Groups: Investigating Social Influence of Multiple Agents in Human-Agent Interactions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.04578v2)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent systems - systems with multiple independent AI agents working together to achieve a common goal - are becoming increasingly prevalent in daily life. Drawing inspiration from the phenomenon of human group social influence, we investigate whether a group of AI agents can create social pressure on users to agree with them, potentially changing their stance on a topic. We conducted a study in which participants discussed social issues with either a single or multiple AI agents, and where the agents either agreed or disagreed with the user's stance on the topic. We found that conversing with multiple agents (holding conversation content constant) increased the social pressure felt by participants, and caused a greater shift in opinion towards the agents' stances on each topic. Our study shows the potential advantages of multi-agent systems over single-agent platforms in causing opinion change. We discuss design implications for possible multi-agent systems that promote social good, as well as the potential for malicious actors to use these systems to manipulate public opinion.</p></details> |  |

We propose Humanoid Agents, a system that guides Generative Agents to behave more like humans by introducing three elements of System 1 processing: Basic needs (e.g. hunger, health and energy), Emotion and Closeness in Relationships. Humanoid Agents are able to use these dynamic elements to adapt their daily activities and conversations with other agents, as supported with empirical experiments. Our system is designed to be extensible to various settings, three of which we demonstrate, as well as to other elements influencing human behavior (e.g. empathy, moral values and cultural background).

While promising greater efficiency and cognitive offloading, the growing complexity and open-endedness of agentic search have outpaced existing evaluation benchmarks and methodologies, which largely assume short search horizons and static answers. In this paper, we introduce Mind2Web 2, a benchmark of 130 realistic, high-quality, and long-horizon tasks that require real-time web browsing and extensive information synthesis, constructed with over 1000 hours of human labor. To address the challenge of evaluating time-varying and complex answers, we propose a novel Agent-as-a-Judge framework. Our method constructs task-specific judge agents based on a tree-structured rubric design to automatically assess both answer correctness and source attribution. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of ten frontier agentic search systems and human performance, along with a detailed error analysis to draw insights for future development. The best-performing system, OpenAI Deep Research, can already achieve 50-70% of human performance while spending half the time, highlighting its great potential. Altogether, Mind2Web 2 provides a rigorous foundation for developing and benchmarking the next generation of agentic search systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Homepage: https://osu-nlp-group.github.io/Mind2Web-2/</p></details> |
| **[A simple learning agent interacting with an agent-based market model](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.10434v4)** | 2023-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the learning dynamics of a single reinforcement learning optimal execution trading agent when it interacts with an event driven agent-based financial market model. Trading takes place asynchronously through a matching engine in event time. The optimal execution agent is considered at different levels of initial order-sizes and differently sized state spaces. The resulting impact on the agent-based model and market are considered using a calibration approach that explores changes in the empirical stylised facts and price impact curves. Convergence, volume trajectory and action trace plots are used to visualise the learning dynamics. Here the smaller state space agents had the number of states they visited converge much faster than the larger state space agents, and they were able to start learning to trade intuitively using the spread and volume states. We find that the moments of the model are robust to the impact of the learning agents except for the Hurst exponent, which was lowered by the introduction of strategic order-splitting. The introduction of the learning agent preserves the shape of the price impact curves but can reduce the trade-sign auto-correlations when their trading volumes increase.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 7 figures.

| **[Multi-Agent Path Finding For Large Agents Is Intractable](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.10387v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The multi-agent path finding (MAPF) problem asks to find a set of paths on a graph such that when synchronously following these paths the agents never encounter a conflict. In the most widespread MAPF formulation, the so-called Classical MAPF, the agents sizes are neglected and two types of conflicts are considered: occupying the same vertex or using the same edge at the same time step. Meanwhile in numerous practical applications, e.g. in robotics, taking into account the agents' sizes is vital to ensure that the MAPF solutions can be safely executed. Introducing large agents yields an additional type of conflict arising when one agent follows an edge and its body overlaps with the body of another agent that is actually not using this same edge (e.g. staying still at some distinct vertex of the graph). Until now it was not clear how harder the problem gets when such conflicts are to be considered while planning. Specifically, it was known that Classical MAPF problem on an undirected graph can be solved in polynomial time, however no complete polynomial-time algorithm was presented to solve MAPF with large agents. In this paper we, for the first time, establish that the latter problem is NP-hard and, thus, if P!=NP no polynomial algorithm for it can, unfortunately, be presented. Our proof is based on the prevalent in the field technique of reducing the seminal 3SAT problem (which is known to be an NP-complete problem) to the problem at hand. In particular, for an arbitrary 3SAT formula we procedurally construct a dedicated graph with specific start and goal vertices and show that the given 3SAT formula is satisfiable iff the corresponding path finding instance has a solution.</p></details> |  |
| **[Agentic Inequality](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.16853v2)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous AI agents, capable of complex planning and action, represent a significant technological evolution beyond current generative tools. As these systems become integrated into political and economic life, their distribution and capabilities will be highly consequential. This paper introduces and explores "agentic inequality" - the potential disparities in power, opportunity, and outcomes stemming from differential access to, and capabilities of, AI agents. We analyse the dual potential of this technology, exploring how agents could both exacerbate existing divides and, under the right conditions, serve as a powerful equalising force. To this end, the paper makes three primary contributions. First, it establishes an analytical framework by delineating the three core dimensions through which this inequality can manifest: disparities in the availability, quality, and quantity of agents. Second, it argues that agentic inequality is distinct from prior technological divides. Unlike tools that primarily augment human abilities, agents act as autonomous delegates, creating novel power asymmetries through scalable goal delegation and direct agent-to-agent competition that are poised to reshape outcomes across economic and socio-political spheres. Finally, it provides a systematic analysis of the technical and socioeconomic drivers - from model release strategies to market incentives - that will shape the distribution of agentic power, concluding with a research agenda for navigating the complex governance challenges ahead.</p></details> |  |

Just as humans benefit from powerful software applications, such as integrated development environments, for complex tasks like software engineering, we posit that LM agents represent a new category of end users with their own needs and abilities, and would benefit from specially-built interfaces to the software they use. We investigate how interface design affects the performance of language model agents. As a result of this exploration, we introduce SWE-agent: a system that facilitates LM agents to autonomously use computers to solve software engineering tasks. SWE-agent's custom agent-computer interface (ACI) significantly enhances an agent's ability to create and edit code files, navigate entire repositories, and execute tests and other programs. We evaluate SWE-agent on SWE-bench and HumanEvalFix, achieving state-of-the-art performance on both with a pass@1 rate of 12.5% and 87.7%, respectively, far exceeding the previous state-of-the-art achieved with non-interactive LMs. Finally, we provide insight on how the design of the ACI can impact agents' behavior and performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code,...</summary><p>Code, data, and demo available at https://swe-agent.com</p></details> |

However, most existing approaches rely heavily on manual prompt engineering, failing to adapt and optimize based on diverse experimental experiences. Focusing on this, for the first time, we explore the paradigm of learning-based agentic ML, where an LLM agent learns through interactive experimentation on ML tasks using online reinforcement learning (RL). To realize this, we propose a novel agentic ML training framework with three key components: (1) exploration-enriched fine-tuning, which enables LLM agents to generate diverse actions for enhanced RL exploration; (2) step-wise RL, which enables training on a single action step, accelerating experience collection and improving training efficiency; (3) an agentic ML-specific reward module, which unifies varied ML feedback signals into consistent rewards for RL optimization. Leveraging this framework, we train ML-Agent, driven by a 7B-sized Qwen-2.5 LLM for autonomous ML. Remarkably, despite being trained on merely 9 ML tasks, our 7B-sized ML-Agent outperforms the 671B-sized DeepSeek-R1 agent. Furthermore, it achieves continuous performance improvements and demonstrates exceptional cross-task generalization capabilities.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we study this Vulnerable Agent Identification (VAI) problem in large-scale multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). We frame VAI as a Hierarchical Adversarial Decentralized Mean Field Control (HAD-MFC), where the upper level involves an NP-hard combinatorial task of selecting the most vulnerable agents, and the lower level learns worst-case adversarial policies for these agents using mean-field MARL. The two problems are coupled together, making HAD-MFC difficult to solve. To solve this, we first decouple the hierarchical process by Fenchel-Rockafellar transform, resulting a regularized mean-field Bellman operator for upper level that enables independent learning at each level, thus reducing computational complexity. We then reformulate the upper-level combinatorial problem as a MDP with dense rewards from our regularized mean-field Bellman operator, enabling us to sequentially identify the most vulnerable agents by greedy and RL algorithms. This decomposition provably preserves the optimal solution of the original HAD-MFC. Experiments show our method effectively identifies more vulnerable agents in large-scale MARL and the rule-based system, fooling system into worse failures, and learns a value function that reveals the vulnerability of each agent.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to NIPS 2025</p></details> |

This paper describes the Fuzzy Decision Analysis used in the negotiation between the SoS agent and a System agent in the ABM of an Acknowledged SoS development. An Acknowledged SoS has by definition a limited influence on the development of the individual Systems. The individual Systems have their own priorities, pressures, and agenda which may or may not align with the goals of the SoS. The SoS has some funding and deadlines which can be used to negotiate with the individual System in order to illicit the required capability from that System. The Fuzzy Decision Analysis determines how the SoS agent will adjust the funding and deadlines for each of the Systems in order to achieve the desired SoS architecture quality. The Fuzzy Decision Analysis has inputs of performance, funding, and deadlines as well as weights for each capability. The performance, funding, and deadlines are crisp values which are fuzzified. The fuzzified values are then used with a Fuzzy Inference Engine to get the fuzzy outputs of funding adjustment and deadline adjustment which must then be defuzzified before being passed to the System agent. The first contribution of this paper is the fuzzy decision analysis that represents the negotiation between the SoS agent and the System agent. A second contribution of this paper is the method of implementing the fuzzy decision analysis which provides a generalized fuzzy decision analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables, International Journal of Soft Computing and Software Engineering [JSCSE], Vol. 3, No. 3, 2013</p></details> |

In this work, we challenge whether high SFT scores translate to improved performance after RL. We provide extensive counter-examples where this is not true. We find high SFT scores can be biased toward simpler or more homogeneous data and are not reliably predictive of subsequent RL gains or scaled-up post-training effectiveness. In some cases, RL training on models with improved SFT performance could lead to substantially worse outcome compared to RL on the base model without SFT. We study alternative metrics and identify generalization loss on held-out reasoning examples and Pass@large k performance to provide strong proxies for the RL outcome. We trained hundreds of models up to 12B-parameter with SFT and RLVR via GRPO and ran extensive evaluations on 7 math benchmarks with up to 256 repetitions, spending $>$1M GPU hours. Experiments include models from Llama3, Mistral-Nemo, Qwen3 and multiple state-of-the-art SFT/RL datasets. Compared to directly predicting from pre-RL performance, prediction based on generalization loss and Pass@large k achieves substantial higher precision, improving $R^2$ coefficient and Spearman's rank correlation coefficient by up to 0.5 (2x). This provides strong utility for broad use cases. For example, in most experiments, we find SFT training on unique examples for a one epoch underperforms training on half examples for two epochs, either after SFT or SFT-then-RL; With the same SFT budget, training only on short examples may lead to better SFT performance, though, it often leads to worse outcome after RL compared to training on examples with varying lengths.

| **[Debunk the Myth of SFT Generalization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.00237v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A prevailing view holds that supervised fine-tuning (SFT) memorizes training data and fails to generalize, whereas reinforcement learning (RL) attains broader robustness. We revisit this claim through a systematic evaluation on two decision-making benchmarks, Sokoban and General Points, and arrive at a different conclusion. We show that much of SFT's perceived failure stems from frozen-prompt artifacts: when trained on fixed instruction templates, SFT models cling to training semantics rather than adapting to new ones. Introducing prompt diversity during training breaks this shortcut and yields strong generalization to unseen instruction variants without harming in-distribution performance. Beyond instruction shifts, we ask whether SFT can generalize to strictly harder tasks. Here, chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision provides an algorithmic scaffold that markedly improves transfer to more difficult regimes, such as larger Sokoban grids with additional boxes and arithmetic with out-of-distribution values or five-card compositions that increase combinatorial complexity. Finally, combining prompt diversity with CoT achieves the best of both worlds: robust generalization across both instruction-variant and difficulty-variant settings, matching or surpassing RL baselines on our benchmarks while retaining SFT's simplicity and stability. These findings challenge the narrative that SFT is inherently inferior to RL and support a data-centric perspective: with appropriately curated demonstrations, vanilla SFT can generalize as strongly as RL.

In particular we prove that all generalized Baumslag-Solitar groups (GBS) admit a strongly aperiodic SFT. Our proof is based on a structural theorem by Whyte and on two constructions of strongly aperiodic SFTs on $\mathbb{F}_n\times \mathbb{Z}$ and $BS(m,n)$ of our own. Our two constructions rely on a path-folding technique that lifts an SFT on $\mathbb{Z}^2$ inside an SFT on $\mathbb{F}_n\times \mathbb{Z}$ or an SFT on the hyperbolic plane inside an SFT on $BS(m,n)$. In the case of $\mathbb{F}_n\times \mathbb{Z}$ the path folding technique also preserves minimality, so that we get minimal strongly aperiodic SFTs on unimodular GBS groups.</p></details> | 31 pages, 13 figures |

However, the evolution and mechanism behind the synergy of SFT and RL are still under-explored and inconclusive. In our study, we find the well-known claim "SFT memorizes, RL generalizes" is over-simplified, and discover that: (1) OOD performance peaks at the early stage of SFT and then declines (OOD forgetting), the best SFT checkpoint cannot be captured by training/test loss; (2) the subsequent RL stage does not generate fundamentally better OOD capability, instead it plays an \textbf{OOD restoration} role, recovering the lost reasoning ability during SFT; (3) The recovery ability has boundaries, \ie{} \textbf{if SFT trains for too short or too long, RL cannot recover the lost OOD ability;} (4) To uncover the underlying mechanisms behind the forgetting and restoration process, we employ SVD analysis on parameter matrices, manually edit them, and observe their impacts on model performance. Unlike the common belief that the shift of model capacity mainly results from the changes of singular values, we find that they are actually quite stable throughout fine-tuning. Instead, the OOD behavior strongly correlates with the \textbf{rotation of singular vectors}. Our findings re-identify the roles of SFT and RL in the two-stage fine-tuning and discover the rotation of singular vectors as the key mechanism. %reversing the rotations induced by SFT, which shows recovery from forgetting, whereas imposing the SFT parameter directions onto a RL-tuned model results in performance degradation.

To be more precise, we prove that given any \pizu subset $P$ of $\{0,1\}^\NN$ there is a SFT $X$ such that $P\times\ZZ^2$ is recursively homeomorphic to $X\setminus U$ where $U$ is a computable set of points. As a consequence, if $P$ contains a recursive member, $P$ and $X$ have the exact same set of Turing degrees. On the other hand, we prove that if $X$ contains only non-recursive members, some of its members always have different but comparable degrees. This gives a fairly complete study of Turing degrees of SFTs.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1102.1189</p></details> |

| **[RLSR: Reinforcement Learning with Supervised Reward Outperforms SFT in Instruction Following](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.14200v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>After the pretraining stage of LLMs, techniques such as SFT, RLHF, RLVR, and RFT are applied to enhance instruction-following ability, mitigate undesired responses, improve reasoning capability and enable efficient domain adaptation with minimal data. SFT relies on the next-token prediction objective to strengthen instruction following in a base model using a large corpus of human-labeled responses. In contrast, RFT employs a RL-based approach to adapt fine-tuned reasoning models to specific domains with limited supervision. Inspired by RFT, we propose replacing SFT with RLSR to leverage the extensive SFT dataset in an RL framework, thereby improving the base model's instruction-following ability. In RLSR, the base model generates multiple responses for each prompt, and reward scores are computed as the cosine similarity in the semantic embedding space between the generated and human-labeled responses. RLSR can be utilized in multiple ways. It can directly replace SFT, achieving superior performance on instruction-following benchmarks-for example, RLSR (SB) on Qwen-7B (INFINITY) achieved an AlpacaEval win rate of 26.34%, surpassing SFT's 21.01%. Furthermore, combining SFT and RLSR further enhances downstream task performance; Qwen-7B (INFINITY) achieved a win rate of 30.73% when trained with SFT + RLSR.</p></details> |  |

Through mathematical analysis, we reveal that standard SFT gradients implicitly encode a problematic reward structure that may severely restrict the generalization capabilities of model. To rectify this, we propose Dynamic Fine-Tuning (DFT), stabilizing gradient updates for each token by dynamically rescaling the objective function with the probability of this token. Remarkably, this single-line code change significantly outperforms standard SFT across multiple challenging benchmarks and base models, demonstrating greatly improved generalization. Additionally, our approach shows competitive results in offline RL settings, offering an effective yet simpler alternative. This work bridges theoretical insight and practical solutions, substantially advancing SFT performance.

| **[Crowd-SFT: Crowdsourcing for LLM Alignment](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.04063v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly rely on Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) to align model responses with human preferences. While RLHF employs a reinforcement learning approach with a separate reward model, SFT uses human-curated datasets for supervised learning. Both approaches traditionally depend on small, vetted groups of annotators, making them costly, prone to bias, and limited in scalability. We propose an open, crowd-sourced fine-tuning framework that addresses these limitations by enabling broader feedback collection for SFT without extensive annotator training. Our framework promotes incentive fairness via a point-based reward system correlated with Shapley values and guides model convergence through iterative model updates. Our multi-model selection framework demonstrates up to a 55% reduction in target distance over single-model selection, enabling subsequent experiments that validate our point-based reward mechanism's close alignment with Shapley values (a well-established method for attributing individual contributions) thereby supporting fair and scalable participation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Implicit Reward as the Bridge: A Unified View of SFT and DPO Connections](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.00018v2)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Post-training processes are essential phases in grounding pre-trained language models to real-world tasks, with learning from demonstrations or preference signals playing a crucial role in this adaptation. We present a unified theoretical framework bridging Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and preference learning in Large Language Model (LLM) post-training. Through rigorous mathematical derivation, we demonstrate that both SFT and preference learning methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) operate within the same optimal policy-reward subspace, with SFT representing a special case of implicit reward learning. Our analysis reveals a critical limitation in conventional SFT: the KL divergence term in distribution matching becomes constant with respect to the policy during optimization, failing to constrain model updates. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective learning rate reduction approach that yields significant performance improvements (up to \textbf{25\%} relative gain and \textbf{6\%} absolute win rate increase in instruction following tasks. Additionally, we derive alternative SFT objectives from various f-divergence functions that preserve the KL term during optimization, further enhancing post-DPO model performance. Finally, we extend the theoretical relationship between LLM logits and Q-functions from preference learning to the SFT context, providing mathematical derivations and experimental validation.</p></details> |  |

Utilizing the Anthropic Helpful-Harmless RLHF dataset, we train and evaluate four models: the base OPT350M, an SFT model, a DPO model, and a model trained with both SFT and DPO. We introduce three key evaluation metrics: Harmlessness Rate (HmR), Helpfulness Rate (HpR), and a Combined Alignment Score (CAS), all derived from reward model outputs. The results show that while SFT outperforms DPO, The combined SFT+DPO model outperforms all others across all metrics, demonstrating the complementary nature of these techniques. Our findings also highlight challenges posed by noisy data, limited GPU resources, and training constraints. This study offers a comprehensive view of how fine-tuning strategies affect model alignment and provides a foundation for more robust alignment pipelines in future work.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 3 figures.

However, how these methods shape reasoning capabilities remains largely elusive. Going beyond an accuracy-based investigation of how these two components sculpt the reasoning process, this paper introduces a novel analysis framework that quantifies reasoning paths and captures their qualitative changes under each training process (with models of 1.5B, 7B, and 14B parameters on mathematical domains). Specifically, we investigate the reasoning process at two levels of granularity: the trajectory-level, which examines complete reasoning outputs, and the step-level, which analyzes reasoning graphs whose nodes correspond to individual reasoning steps. Notably, clustering of unique reasoning trajectories shows complementary effects: RL compresses incorrect trajectories, whereas SFT expands correct ones. Step-level analysis reveals that RL steepens (about 2.5 times), while SFT flattens (reduced to about one-third), the decay rates of node visitation frequency, degree, and betweenness centrality distributions in the reasoning graph. This indicates that RL concentrates reasoning functionality into a small subset of steps, while SFT homogenizes it across many steps. Furthermore, by evaluating the reasoning graph topologies from multiple perspectives, we delineate the shared and distinct characteristics of RL and SFT. Our work presents a novel reasoning path perspective that explains why the current best practice of two-stage training, with SFT followed by RL, is successful, and offers practical implications for data construction and more efficient learning approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Empowering Lightweight MLLMs with Reasoning via Long CoT SFT](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.03321v2)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards has enhanced the reasoning of large-scale language models (LLMs), its efficacy for lightweight multimodal language models (MLLMs) with fewer than seven billion parameters remains underexplored. This paper investigates the role of long Chain-of-Thought (long CoT) data in enhancing the reasoning abilities of such MLLMs. Our findings demonstrate that Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with long CoT data significantly improves MLLM reasoning. Furthermore, we observe that after this initial SFT phase, MLLMs can achieve additional performance gains through a subsequent RL stage. We conclude that a SFT stage with long CoT data is a critical prerequisite for developing the reasoning capabilities of lightweight MLLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Two-Stage Training: Cooperative SFT and RL for LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.06948v2)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven effective in incentivizing the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), but suffers from severe efficiency challenges due to its trial-and-error nature. While the common practice employs supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a warm-up stage for RL, this decoupled two-stage approach suffers from catastrophic forgetting: second-stage RL gradually loses SFT-acquired behaviors and inefficiently explores new patterns. This study introduces a novel method for learning reasoning models that employs bilevel optimization to facilitate better cooperation between these training paradigms. By conditioning the SFT objective on the optimal RL policy, our approach enables SFT to meta-learn how to guide RL's optimization process. During training, the lower level performs RL updates while simultaneously receiving SFT supervision, and the upper level explicitly maximizes the cooperative gain-the performance advantage of joint SFT-RL training over RL alone. Empirical evaluations on five reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms baselines and achieves a better balance between effectiveness and efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Continual SFT Matches Multimodal RLHF with Negative Supervision](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.14797v1)** | 2024-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal RLHF usually happens after supervised finetuning (SFT) stage to continually improve vision-language models' (VLMs) comprehension. Conventional wisdom holds its superiority over continual SFT during this preference alignment stage. In this paper, we observe that the inherent value of multimodal RLHF lies in its negative supervision, the logit of the rejected responses. We thus propose a novel negative supervised finetuning (nSFT) approach that fully excavates these information resided. Our nSFT disentangles this negative supervision in RLHF paradigm, and continually aligns VLMs with a simple SFT loss. This is more memory efficient than multimodal RLHF where 2 (e.g., DPO) or 4 (e.g., PPO) large VLMs are strictly required. The effectiveness of nSFT is rigorously proved by comparing it with various multimodal RLHF approaches, across different dataset sources, base VLMs and evaluation metrics. Besides, fruitful of ablations are provided to support our hypothesis. We hope this paper will stimulate further research to properly align large vision language models.</p></details> |  |
| **[RL makes MLLMs see better than SFT](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.16333v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A dominant assumption in Multimodal Language Model (MLLM) research is that its performance is largely inherited from the LLM backbone, given its immense parameter scale and remarkable capabilities. This has created a void in the understanding of the vision encoder, which determines how MLLMs perceive images. The recent shift in MLLM training paradigms, from Supervised Finetuning (SFT) to Reinforcement Learning (RL), magnifies this oversight-namely, the significant lack of analysis on how such training reshapes the vision encoder as well as the MLLM. To address this, we first investigate the impact of training strategies on MLLMs, where RL shows a clear advantage over SFT in strongly vision-related VQA benchmarks. Motivated by this, we conduct a critical yet under-explored analysis of the vision encoder of MLLMs through diverse and in-depth experiments, ranging from ImageNet classification and segmentation to gradient visualization. Our results demonstrate that MLLM's post-training strategy (i.e., SFT or RL) not only leads to distinct outcomes on MLLM downstream tasks, but also fundamentally reshapes MLLM's underlying visual representations. Specifically, the key finding of our study is that RL produces stronger and precisely localized visual representations compared to SFT, boosting the ability of the vision encoder for MLLM. We then reframe our findings into a simple recipe for building strong vision encoders for MLLMs, Preference-Instructed Vision OpTimization (PIVOT). When integrated into MLLMs, a PIVOT-trained vision encoder outperforms even larger and more heavily-trained counterparts, despite requiring less than 1% of the computational cost of standard vision pretraining. This result opens an effective and efficient path for advancing the vision backbones of MLLMs. Project page available at https://june-page.github.io/pivot/</p></details> |  |

| **[Getting More Juice Out of the SFT Data: Reward Learning from Human Demonstration Improves SFT for LLM Alignment](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.17888v3)** | 2024-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aligning human preference and value is an important requirement for contemporary foundation models. State-of-the-art techniques such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) often consist of two stages: 1) supervised fine-tuning (SFT), where the model is fine-tuned by learning from human demonstration data; 2) Preference learning, where preference data is used to learn a reward model, which is in turn used by a reinforcement learning (RL) step to fine-tune the model. Such reward model serves as a proxy to human preference, and it is critical to guide the RL step towards improving the model quality. In this work, we argue that the SFT stage significantly benefits from learning a reward model as well. Instead of using the human demonstration data directly via supervised learning, we propose to leverage an Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) technique to simultaneously build an reward model and a policy model. This approach leads to new SFT algorithms that are not only efficient to implement, but are robust to the presence of low-quality supervised learning data. Moreover, we discover a connection between the proposed IRL based approach, and a recent line of works called Self-Play Fine-tune (SPIN). Theoretically, we show that the proposed algorithms converge to the stationary solutions of the IRL problem. Empirically, we align 1B and 7B models using proposed methods and evaluate them on a reward benchmark model and the HuggingFace Open LLM Leaderboard. The proposed methods show significant performance improvement over existing SFT approaches. Our results indicate that it is beneficial to leverage reward learning throughout the entire alignment process.</p></details> |  |
| **[SFT Memorizes, RL Generalizes: A Comparative Study of Foundation Model Post-training](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.17161v2)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) are widely used post-training techniques for foundation models. However, their roles in enhancing model generalization capabilities remain unclear. This paper studies the difference between SFT and RL on generalization and memorization, focusing on text-based rule variants and visual variants. We introduce GeneralPoints, an arithmetic reasoning card game, and adopt V-IRL, a real-world navigation environment, to assess how models trained with SFT and RL generalize to unseen variants in both textual and visual domains. We show that RL, especially when trained with an outcome-based reward, generalizes across both rule-based textual and visual variants. SFT, in contrast, tends to memorize training data and struggles to generalize out-of-distribution scenarios. Further analysis reveals that RL improves the model's underlying visual recognition capabilities, contributing to its enhanced generalization in the visual domain. Despite RL's superior generalization, we show that SFT remains essential for effective RL training; SFT stabilizes the model's output format, enabling subsequent RL to achieve its performance gains. These findings demonstrates the capability of RL for acquiring generalizable knowledge in complex, multi-modal tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website at https://tianzhechu.com/SFTvsRL</p></details> |

Two particularly popular approaches are reinforcement learning (RL) and supervised fine-tuning (SFT), but their training dynamics are poorly understood. We present a comparative analysis of RL and SFT on the same maths problems with the same model and similar hyperparameters. We find that RL yields minor in-domain gains on maths and slight degradation on knowledge-intensive benchmarks like MMLU, while both trends are more pronounced in SFT. We also analyse model parameters across checkpoints, observing that both algorithms modify query and key weights the most. Meanwhile, SFT exhibits greater updates and also affects mid-layer MLPs more, leading us to hypothesise that this may have caused the out-of-domain degradation. We therefore investigate whether freezing parts of the model during training can mitigate the reduced performance on knowledge-intensive benchmarks. However, our results are inconclusive, with benefits on GPQA:Diamond and degradation on other benchmarks. Taken together, our observations provide a preliminary indication for why RL amplifies existing capabilities, while SFT replaces old skills with new ones.</p></details> |  |

This is an important yet challenging problem due to the under-constrained nature of the monocular setting. Existing SfT techniques predominantly use geometric and simplified deformation models, which often limits their reconstruction abilities. In contrast to previous works, this paper proposes a new SfT approach explaining 2D observations through physical simulations accounting for forces and material properties. Our differentiable physics simulator regularises the surface evolution and optimises the material elastic properties such as bending coefficients, stretching stiffness and density. We use a differentiable renderer to minimise the dense reprojection error between the estimated 3D states and the input images and recover the deformation parameters using an adaptive gradient-based optimisation. For the evaluation, we record with an RGB-D camera challenging real surfaces exposed to physical forces with various material properties and textures. Our approach significantly reduces the 3D reconstruction error compared to multiple competing methods.

However, existing SFT methods typically treat each training instance as a uniform sequence, giving equal importance to all tokens regardless of their relevance. This overlooks the fact that only a subset of tokens often contains critical, task-specific information. To address this limitation, we introduce Supervised Fine-Tuning with Group Optimization (SFT-GO), a novel approach that treats groups of tokens differently based on their importance.SFT-GO groups tokens in each sample based on their importance values and optimizes the LLM using a weighted combination of the worst-group loss and the standard cross-entropy loss. This mechanism adaptively emphasizes the most challenging token groups and guides the model to better handle different group distributions, thereby improving overall learning dynamics. We provide a theoretical analysis of SFT-GO's convergence rate, demonstrating its efficiency. Empirically, we apply SFT-GO with three different token grouping strategies and show that models trained with SFT-GO consistently outperform baseline approaches across popular LLM benchmarks. These improvements hold across various datasets and base models, demonstrating the robustness and the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> |  |

We begin by curating the SFT training data through two scaling strategies: increasing the number of collected prompts and the number of generated responses per prompt. Both approaches yield notable improvements in reasoning performance, with scaling the number of prompts resulting in more substantial gains. We then explore the following questions regarding the synergy between SFT and RL: (i) Does a stronger SFT model consistently lead to better final performance after large-scale RL training? (ii) How can we determine an appropriate sampling temperature during RL training to effectively balance exploration and exploitation for a given SFT initialization? Our findings suggest that (i) holds true, provided effective RL training is conducted, particularly when the sampling temperature is carefully chosen to maintain the temperature-adjusted entropy around 0.3, a setting that strikes a good balance between exploration and exploitation. Notably, the performance gap between initial SFT models narrows significantly throughout the RL process. Leveraging a strong SFT foundation and insights into the synergistic interplay between SFT and RL, our AceReason-Nemotron-1.1 7B model significantly outperforms AceReason-Nemotron-1.0 and achieves new state-of-the-art performance among Qwen2.5-7B-based reasoning models on challenging math and code benchmarks, thereby demonstrating the effectiveness of our post-training recipe.

While text-based reasoning models (e.g., Deepseek R1) show promising results in text-only tasks, distilling their reasoning into LVLMs via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) often results in performance degradation due to imprecise visual grounding. Conversely, purely reinforcement learning (RL)-based methods face a large search space, hindering the emergence of reflective behaviors in smaller models (e.g., 7B LVLMs). Surprisingly, alternating between SFT and RL ultimately results in significant performance improvements after a few iterations. Our analysis reveals that the base model rarely exhibits reasoning behaviors initially, but SFT effectively surfaces these latent actions and narrows the RL search space, accelerating the development of reasoning capabilities. Each subsequent RL stage further refines the model's reasoning skills, producing higher-quality SFT data for continued self-improvement. OpenVLThinker-7B consistently advances performance across six benchmarks demanding mathematical and general reasoning, notably improving MathVista by 3.8%, EMMA by 2.4%, and HallusionBench by 1.6%.

| **[Bridging SFT and DPO for Diffusion Model Alignment with Self-Sampling Preference Optimization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.05255v2)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing post-training techniques are broadly categorized into supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) methods; the former is stable during training but suffers from limited generalization, while the latter, despite its stronger generalization capability, relies on additional preference data or reward models and carries the risk of reward exploitation. In order to preserve the advantages of both SFT and RL -- namely, eliminating the need for paired data and reward models while retaining the training stability of SFT and the generalization ability of RL -- a new alignment method, Self-Sampling Preference Optimization (SSPO), is proposed in this paper. SSPO introduces a Random Checkpoint Replay (RCR) strategy that utilizes historical checkpoints to construct paired data, thereby effectively mitigating overfitting. Simultaneously, a Self-Sampling Regularization (SSR) strategy is employed to dynamically evaluate the quality of generated samples; when the generated samples are more likely to be winning samples, the approach automatically switches from DPO (Direct Preference Optimization) to SFT, ensuring that the training process accurately reflects the quality of the samples. Experimental results demonstrate that SSPO not only outperforms existing methods on text-to-image benchmarks, but its effectiveness has also been validated in text-to-video tasks. We validate SSPO across both text-to-image and text-to-video benchmarks. SSPO surpasses all previous approaches on the text-to-image benchmarks and demonstrates outstanding performance on the text-to-video benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

Comparing to SFT, there are many efforts focused on RLHF and several algorithms being proposed, such as PPO, DPO, IPO, KTO, MinorDPO and etc. Meanwhile most efforts for SFT are focused on how to collect, filter and mix high quality data. In this article with insight from DPO and MinorDPO, we propose a training metric for SFT to measure the discrepancy between the optimized model and the original model, and a loss function MinorSFT that can increase the training effectiveness, and reduce the discrepancy between the optimized LLM and original LLM.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |
| **[BREAD: Branched Rollouts from Expert Anchors Bridge SFT & RL for Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.17211v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Small language models (SLMs) struggle to learn complex reasoning behaviors, especially when high-quality traces are scarce or difficult to learn from. The standard training approach combines a supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage, often to distill capabilities of a larger model, followed by a reinforcement learning (RL)stage such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). In this paper, we investigate the fundamental limitations of this SFT + RL paradigm and propose methods to overcome them. Under a suitable theoretical model, we demonstrate that the SFT + RL strategy can fail completely when (1) the expert's traces are too difficult for the small model to express, or (2) the small model's initialization has exponentially small likelihood of success. To address these, we introduce BREAD: a GRPO variant that unifies the SFT and RL stages via partial expert guidance and branched rollouts. When self-generated traces fail, BREAD adaptively inserts short expert prefixes/hints, allowing the small model to complete the rest of the reasoning path, and ensuring that each update includes at least one successful trace. This mechanism both densifies the reward signal and induces a natural learning curriculum. BREAD requires fewer than 40% of ground-truth traces, consistently outperforming standard GRPO while speeding up the training by about 3 times. Importantly, we demonstrate that BREAD helps the model solve problems that are otherwise unsolvable by the SFT + RL strategy, highlighting how branched rollouts and expert guidance can substantially boost SLM reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[UFT: Unifying Fine-Tuning of SFT and RLHF/DPO/UNA through a Generalized Implicit Reward Function](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.21438v2)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>By pretraining on trillions of tokens, an LLM gains the capability of text generation. However, to enhance its utility and reduce potential harm, SFT and alignment are applied sequentially to the pretrained model. Due to the differing nature and objective functions of SFT and alignment, catastrophic forgetting has become a significant issue. To address this, we introduce Unified Fine-Tuning (UFT), which integrates SFT and alignment into a single training stage using the same objective and loss functions through an implicit reward function. Our experimental results demonstrate that UFT outperforms SFT on instruction-tuning data alone. Moreover, when combining instruction-tuning data with alignment data, UFT effectively prevents catastrophic forgetting across these two stages and shows a clear advantage over sequentially applying SFT and alignment. This is evident in the significant improvements observed in the \textbf{ifeval} task for instruction-following and the \textbf{truthful-qa} task for factuality. The proposed general fine-tuning framework UFT establishes an effective and efficient pretraining-UFT paradigm for LLM training.</p></details> |  |
| **[Breaking the SFT Plateau: Multimodal Structured Reinforcement Learning for Chart-to-Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.13587v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While reinforcement learning (RL) has proven highly effective for general reasoning in vision-language models, its application to tasks requiring in-depth understanding of information-rich images and generation of structured outputs remains underexplored. Chart-to-code generation exemplifies this challenge, demanding complex reasoning over visual charts to generate structured code. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) alone is often insufficient, highlighting the need for effective RL strategies that appropriately reward structured outputs. We systematically investigate the performance plateau in SFT through large-scale experiments and propose Multimodal Structured Reinforcement Learning (MSRL) for chart-to-code generation, which substantially breaks through this plateau. We construct the largest training corpus to date, containing 3 million chart-code pairs from real-world arXiv tables to mitigate simplistic patterns of prior synthetic data. Despite reaching state-of-the-art performance, our experiments show that scaling SFT data eventually hits a plateau where further increases yield negligible improvements. Our MSRL method leverages a multi-granularity structured reward system using multimodal textual and visual feedback. At the textual level, rule-based rewards validate fine-grained code details. At the visual level, model-based rewards assess structural similarity by rendering generated code into images and employing an evaluator model. We implement this within a two-stage curriculum for training stability. Results demonstrate that MSRL significantly breaks the SFT plateau, improving high-level metrics by 6.2% and 9.9% on ChartMimic and ReachQA benchmarks respectively, achieving competitive performance with advanced closed-source models.</p></details> | technical report |
| **[Blockwise SFT for Diffusion Language Models: Reconciling Bidirectional Attention and Autoregressive Decoding](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.19529v2)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Discrete diffusion language models have shown strong potential for text generation, yet standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT) misaligns with their semi-autoregressive inference: training randomly masks tokens across the entire response, while inference generates fixed-size blocks sequentially. This mismatch introduces noisy prefixes and leaky suffixes, biasing gradients away from the desired blockwise likelihood. We propose Blockwise SFT, which partitions responses into fixed-size blocks, selects one active block per step for stochastic masking, freezes all preceding tokens, and fully hides future ones. Loss is computed only over the active block, directly mirroring the blockwise decoding process. Experiments on GSM8K, MATH, and MetaMathQA show consistent gains over classical SFT under equal compute or token budgets. Block size consistency studies and ablations confirm that improvements stem from faithful training-inference alignment rather than incidental masking effects. Our results highlight the importance of matching supervision granularity to the decoding procedure in diffusion-based language models.</p></details> |  |
| **[SFT or RL? An Early Investigation into Training R1-Like Reasoning Large Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.11468v1)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work revisits the dominant supervised fine-tuning (SFT) then reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm for training Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), and reveals a key finding: SFT can significantly undermine subsequent RL by inducing ``pseudo reasoning paths'' imitated from expert models. While these paths may resemble the native reasoning paths of RL models, they often involve prolonged, hesitant, less informative steps, and incorrect reasoning. To systematically study this effect, we introduce VLAA-Thinking, a new multimodal dataset designed to support reasoning in LVLMs. Constructed via a six-step pipeline involving captioning, reasoning distillation, answer rewrite and verification, VLAA-Thinking comprises high-quality, step-by-step visual reasoning traces for SFT, along with a more challenging RL split from the same data source. Using this dataset, we conduct extensive experiments comparing SFT, RL and their combinations. Results show that while SFT helps models learn reasoning formats, it often locks aligned models into imitative, rigid reasoning modes that impede further learning. In contrast, building on the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a novel mixed reward module integrating both perception and cognition signals, our RL approach fosters more genuine, adaptive reasoning behavior. Notably, our model VLAA-Thinker, based on Qwen2.5VL 3B, achieves top-1 performance on Open LMM Reasoning Leaderboard (https://huggingface.co/spaces/opencompass/Open_LMM_Reasoning_Leaderboard) among 4B scale LVLMs, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art by 1.8%. We hope our findings provide valuable insights in developing reasoning-capable LVLMs and can inform future research in this area.</p></details> |  |

However, RLHF has been continuously challenged by its high complexity in implementation and computation consumption. Even with recent simplifications, such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Advantage Leftover Lunch (A-LoL), the problems of over-fitting and training instability remain hindering the alignment process from the expected optimal performance. To address the existing challenges, we propose a novel simplification of RLHF from the perspective of variational inference, called $\textbf{V}$ariational $\textbf{A}$lignment with $\textbf{R}$e-weighting ($\textbf{VAR}$). More specifically, by directly minimizing the distribution gap between the learning LLM policy and the optimal solution of RLHF, we transform the alignment objective into a reward-driven re-weighted supervised fine-tuning (SFT) form, which only requires minor adjustment on the SFT loss to obtain noticeable improvement on training stability and effectiveness. On comprehensive alignment and generation benchmarks, our VAR method has numerically achieved competitive performance in LLM alignment helpfulness and harmlessness.</p></details> |  |

However, manual thematic analysis is time-consuming and limits scalability. Recent advances in LLMs offer a pathway to automate thematic analysis, but alignment with human results remains limited. To address these limitations, we propose SFT-TA, an automated thematic analysis framework that embeds supervised fine-tuned (SFT) agents within a multi-agent system. Our framework outperforms existing frameworks and the gpt-4o baseline in alignment with human reference themes. We observed that SFT agents alone may underperform, but achieve better results than the baseline when embedded within a multi-agent system. Our results highlight that embedding SFT agents in specific roles within a multi-agent system is a promising pathway to improve alignment with desired outputs for thematic analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Synergy Dilemma of Long-CoT SFT and RL: Investigating Post-Training Techniques for Reasoning VLMs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.07562v1)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large vision-language models (VLMs) increasingly adopt post-training techniques such as long chain-of-thought (CoT) supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) to elicit sophisticated reasoning. While these methods exhibit synergy in language-only models, their joint effectiveness in VLMs remains uncertain. We present a systematic investigation into the distinct roles and interplay of long-CoT SFT and RL across multiple multimodal reasoning benchmarks. We find that SFT improves performance on difficult questions by in-depth, structured reasoning, but introduces verbosity and degrades performance on simpler ones. In contrast, RL promotes generalization and brevity, yielding consistent improvements across all difficulty levels, though the improvements on the hardest questions are less prominent compared to SFT. Surprisingly, combining them through two-staged, interleaved, or progressive training strategies, as well as data mixing and model merging, all fails to produce additive benefits, instead leading to trade-offs in accuracy, reasoning style, and response length. This ``synergy dilemma'' highlights the need for more seamless and adaptive approaches to unlock the full potential of combined post-training techniques for reasoning VLMs.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing models focus on the abilities of generating correct code, but often struggle with bug repair. We introduce a suit of methods to enhance LLM's SQL bug-fixing abilities. The methods are mainly consisted of two parts: A Progressive Dataset Construction (PDC) from scratch and Dynamic Mask Supervised Fine-tuning (DM-SFT). PDC proposes two data expansion methods from the perspectives of breadth first and depth first respectively. DM-SFT introduces an efficient bug-fixing supervised learning approach, which effectively reduce the total training steps and mitigate the "disorientation" in SQL code bug-fixing training. In our evaluation, the code LLM models trained with two methods have exceeds all current best performing model which size is much larger.</p></details> | <details><summary>COLIN...</summary><p>COLING-Industry 2025 accepted</p></details> |

With the rapid scaling of Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly through reinforcement learning (RL), there is a growing need for more capable discriminators. Consequently, advances in classification are becoming increasingly vital for enhancing the overall capabilities of LLMs. Traditional discriminative methods map text to labels but overlook LLMs' intrinsic generative strengths. Generative classification addresses this by prompting the model to directly output labels. However, existing studies still rely on simple SFT alone, seldom probing the interplay between training and inference prompts, and no work has systematically leveraged RL for generative text classifiers and unified SFT, RL, and inference-time prompting in one framework. We bridge this gap with GenCLS++, a framework that jointly optimizes SFT and RL while systematically exploring five high-level strategy dimensions-in-context learning variants, category definitions, explicit uncertainty labels, semantically irrelevant numeric labels, and perplexity-based decoding-during both training and inference. After an SFT "policy warm-up," we apply RL with a simple rule-based reward, yielding sizable extra gains. Across seven datasets, GenCLS++ achieves an average accuracy improvement of 3.46% relative to the naive SFT baseline; on public datasets, this improvement rises to 4.00%. Notably, unlike reasoning-intensive tasks that benefit from explicit thinking processes, we find that classification tasks perform better without such reasoning steps. These insights into the role of explicit reasoning provide valuable guidance for future LLM applications.</p></details> |  |

While Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) are the dominant training paradigms, a systematic methodology for combining them to maximize both accuracy and efficiency remains largely unexplored. This paper introduces a practical and effective training recipe that strategically integrates extended SFT with RL from online inference (GRPO). We posit that these methods play complementary, not competing, roles: a prolonged SFT phase first pushes the model's accuracy to its limits, after which a GRPO phase dramatically improves token efficiency while preserving this peak performance. Our experiments reveal that extending SFT for as many as 10 epochs is crucial for performance breakthroughs, and that the primary role of GRPO in this framework is to optimize solution length. The efficacy of our recipe is rigorously validated through top-tier performance on challenging benchmarks, including a high rank among over 2,200 teams in the strictly leak-free AI Mathematical Olympiad (AIMO). This work provides the community with a battle-tested blueprint for developing state-of-the-art mathematical reasoners that are both exceptionally accurate and practically efficient. To ensure full reproducibility and empower future research, we will open-source our entire framework, including all code, model checkpoints, and training configurations at https://github.com/analokmaus/kaggle-aimo2-fast-math-r1.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at ICML 2025 Workshop on The second AI for MATH</p></details> |
| **[Metis-RISE: RL Incentivizes and SFT Enhances Multimodal Reasoning Model Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.13056v2)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have witnessed a surge in the development of advanced reasoning paradigms, which are now being integrated into multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However, existing approaches often fall short: methods solely employing reinforcement learning (RL) can struggle with sample inefficiency and activating entirely absent reasoning capabilities, while conventional pipelines that initiate with a cold-start supervised fine-tuning (SFT) phase before RL may restrict the model's exploratory capacity and face suboptimal convergence. In this work, we introduce \textbf{Metis-RISE} (\textbf{R}L \textbf{I}ncentivizes and \textbf{S}FT \textbf{E}nhances) for multimodal reasoning model learning. Unlike conventional approaches, Metis-RISE distinctively omits an initial SFT stage, beginning instead with an RL phase (e.g., using a Group Relative Policy Optimization variant) to incentivize and activate the model's latent reasoning capacity. Subsequently, the targeted SFT stage addresses two key challenges identified during RL: (1) \textit{inefficient trajectory sampling} for tasks where the model possesses but inconsistently applies correct reasoning, which we tackle using self-distilled reasoning trajectories from the RL model itself; and (2) \textit{fundamental capability absence}, which we address by injecting expert-augmented knowledge for prompts where the model entirely fails. This strategic application of RL for incentivization followed by SFT for enhancement forms the core of Metis-RISE, leading to two versions of our MLLMs (7B and 72B parameters). Evaluations on the OpenCompass Multimodal Reasoning Leaderboard demonstrate that both models achieve state-of-the-art performance among similar-sized models, with the 72B version ranking fourth overall.

We investigate the existence of countable covers for gap width shifts, where the number of nonzero symbols in a configuration is bounded by a function of the minimum distance between two such symbols. As our main results, we characterize those one-dimensional gap width shifts whose two-dimensional lift is a countably covered sofic shift, and show that a large class of two-dimensional gap width shifts are countably covered.</p></details> | 38 pages, 9 figures |
| **[How Much Backtracking is Enough? Exploring the Interplay of SFT and RL in Enhancing LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.24273v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs) have effectively improved their reasoning abilities, particularly on mathematical and logical problems that have verifiable answers, through techniques such as supervised finetuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL). Prior research indicates that RL effectively internalizes search strategies, enabling long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, with backtracking emerging naturally as a learned capability. However, the precise benefits of backtracking, specifically, how significantly it contributes to reasoning improvements and the optimal extent of its use, remain poorly understood. In this work, we systematically investigate the dynamics between SFT and RL on eight reasoning tasks: Countdown, Sudoku, Arc 1D, Geometry, Color Cube Rotation, List Functions, Zebra Puzzles, and Self Reference. Our findings highlight that short CoT sequences used in SFT as a warm-up do have moderate contribution to RL training, compared with cold-start RL; however such contribution diminishes when tasks become increasingly difficult. Motivated by this observation, we construct synthetic datasets varying systematically in the number of backtracking steps and conduct controlled experiments to isolate the influence of either the correctness (content) or the structure (i.e., backtrack frequency). We find that (1) longer CoT with backtracks generally induce better and more stable RL training, (2) more challenging problems with larger search space tend to need higher numbers of backtracks during the SFT stage. Additionally, we demonstrate through experiments on distilled data that RL training is largely unaffected by the correctness of long CoT sequences, suggesting that RL prioritizes structural patterns over content correctness. Collectively, our results offer practical insights into designing optimal training strategies to effectively scale reasoning in LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automatically Generating Numerous Context-Driven SFT Data for LLMs across Diverse Granularity](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.16579v1)** | 2024-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Constructing high-quality query-response pairs from custom corpus is crucial for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) large language models (LLMs) in many applications, like creating domain-specific AI assistants or roleplaying agents. However, sourcing this data through human annotation is costly, and existing automated methods often fail to capture the diverse range of contextual granularity and tend to produce homogeneous data. To tackle these issues, we introduce a novel method named AugCon, capable of automatically generating context-driven SFT data across multiple levels of granularity with high diversity, quality and fidelity. AugCon begins by generating queries using the Context-Split-Tree (CST), an innovative approach for recursively deriving queries and splitting context to cover full granularity. Then, we train a scorer through contrastive learning to collaborate with CST to rank and refine queries. Finally, a synergistic integration of self-alignment and self-improving is introduced to obtain high-fidelity responses. Extensive experiments are conducted incorporating both human and automatic evaluations, encompassing a test scenario and four widely-used benchmarks in English and Chinese. The results highlight the significant advantages of AugCon in producing high diversity, quality, and fidelity SFT data against several state-of-the-art methods. All of our code, dataset, and fine-tuned model will be available at: https://github.com/quanshr/AugCon.</p></details> |  |
| **[TEMPLE:Temporal Preference Learning of Video LLMs via Difficulty Scheduling and Pre-SFT Alignment](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.16929v2)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Large Language Models (Video LLMs) have achieved significant success by leveraging a two-stage paradigm: pretraining on large-scale video-text data for vision-language alignment, followed by supervised fine-tuning (SFT) for task-specific capabilities. However, existing approaches struggle with temporal reasoning due to weak temporal correspondence in the data and reliance on the next-token prediction paradigm during training. To address these limitations, we propose TEMPLE (TEMporal Preference Learning), a systematic framework that enhances Video LLMs' temporal reasoning capabilities through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). To facilitate this, we introduce an automated preference data generation pipeline that systematically constructs preference pairs by selecting videos that are rich in temporal information, designing video-specific perturbation strategies, and finally evaluating model responses on clean and perturbed video inputs. Our temporal alignment features two key innovations: curriculum learning which that progressively increases perturbation difficulty to improve model robustness and adaptability; and "Pre-SFT Alignment'', applying preference optimization before instruction tuning to prioritize fine-grained temporal comprehension. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently improves Video LLM performance across multiple benchmarks with a relatively small set of self-generated DPO data. We further analyze the transferability of DPO data across architectures and the role of difficulty scheduling in optimization. Our findings highlight our TEMPLE as a scalable and efficient complement to SFT-based methods, paving the way for developing reliable Video LLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/lscpku/TEMPLE.</p></details> |  |

While full fine-tuning is a powerful adaptation method, it is computationally expensive and can lead to a degradation of general reasoning abilities, a phenomenon known as catastrophic forgetting. A range of alternative techniques exists, each with its own trade-offs. In-Context Learning (ICL) is fast but limited by context length, while Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) offer a middle ground by minimizing parameter changes. However, the challenge of catastrophic forgetting persists, raising questions about the best adaptation strategy for a given task. This paper presents a comparative analysis of Supervised Finetuning (SFT), LoRA, and ICL in data-scarce scenarios. We find that LoRA provides the most effective balance, successfully instilling new skills with minimal impact on the base model's general knowledge. In contrast, while SFT excels at skill acquisition, it is highly susceptible to catastrophic forgetting. ICL is effective for incorporating factual knowledge but struggles with complex skills. Our findings offer a practical framework for selecting an LLM adaptation strategy. We highlight the critical distinction between skill acquisition and knowledge integration, clarify the trade-offs between task-specific performance and the preservation of general capabilities.</p></details> |  |

However, attempts to extend this success to multimodal reasoning often failed to reproduce these key characteristics. In this report, we present the first successful replication of these emergent characteristics for multimodal reasoning on only a non-SFT 2B model. Starting with Qwen2-VL-2B and applying reinforcement learning directly on the SAT dataset, our model achieves 59.47% accuracy on CVBench, outperforming the base model by approximately ~30% and exceeding both SFT setting by ~2%. In addition, we share our failed attempts and insights in attempting to achieve R1-like reasoning using RL with instruct models. aiming to shed light on the challenges involved. Our key observations include: (1) applying RL on instruct model often results in trivial reasoning trajectories, and (2) naive length reward are ineffective in eliciting reasoning capabilities.

| **[SFT Doesn't Always Hurt General Capabilities: Revisiting Domain-Specific Fine-Tuning in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.20758v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on domain-specific datasets is a common approach to adapt Large Language Models (LLMs) to specialized tasks but is often believed to degrade their general capabilities. In this work, we revisit this trade-off and present both empirical and theoretical insights. First, we show that SFT does not always hurt: using a smaller learning rate can substantially mitigate general performance degradation while preserving comparable target-domain performance. We then provide a theoretical analysis that explains these phenomena and further motivates a new method, Token-Adaptive Loss Reweighting (TALR). Building on this, and recognizing that smaller learning rates alone do not fully eliminate general-performance degradation in all cases, we evaluate a range of strategies for reducing general capability loss, including L2 regularization, LoRA, model averaging, FLOW, and our proposed TALR. Experimental results demonstrate that while no method completely eliminates the trade-off, TALR consistently outperforms these baselines in balancing domain-specific gains and general capabilities. Finally, we distill our findings into practical guidelines for adapting LLMs to new domains: (i) using a small learning rate to achieve a favorable trade-off, and (ii) when a stronger balance is further desired, adopt TALR as an effective strategy.</p></details> |  |

However, the specific capabilities enhanced through such fine-tuning remain poorly understood. In this paper, we conduct a detailed analysis of model performance on the AIME24 dataset to understand how reasoning capabilities evolve. We discover a ladder-like structure in problem difficulty, categorize questions into four tiers (Easy, Medium, Hard, and Extremely Hard (Exh)), and identify the specific requirements for advancing between tiers. We find that progression from Easy to Medium tier requires adopting an R1 reasoning style with minimal SFT (500-1K instances), while Hard-level questions suffer from frequent model's errors at each step of the reasoning chain, with accuracy plateauing at around 65% despite logarithmic scaling. Exh-level questions present a fundamentally different challenge; they require unconventional problem-solving skills that current models uniformly struggle with. Additional findings reveal that carefully curated small-scale datasets offer limited advantage-scaling dataset size proves far more effective. Our analysis provides a clearer roadmap for advancing language model capabilities in mathematical reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Provably Mitigating Overoptimization in RLHF: Your SFT Loss is Implicitly an Adversarial Regularizer](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.16436v3)** | 2024-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aligning generative models with human preference via RLHF typically suffers from overoptimization, where an imperfectly learned reward model can misguide the generative model to output undesired responses. We investigate this problem in a principled manner by identifying the source of the misalignment as a form of distributional shift and uncertainty in learning human preferences. To mitigate overoptimization, we first propose a theoretical algorithm that chooses the best policy for an adversarially chosen reward model; one that simultaneously minimizes the maximum likelihood estimation of the loss and a reward penalty term. Here, the reward penalty term is introduced to prevent the policy from choosing actions with spurious high proxy rewards, resulting in provable sample efficiency of the algorithm under a partial coverage style condition. Moving from theory to practice, the proposed algorithm further enjoys an equivalent but surprisingly easy-to-implement reformulation. Using the equivalence between reward models and the corresponding optimal policy, the algorithm features a simple objective that combines: (i) a preference optimization loss that directly aligns the policy with human preference, and (ii) a supervised learning loss that explicitly imitates the policy with a (suitable) baseline distribution. In the context of aligning large language models (LLM), this objective fuses the direct preference optimization (DPO) loss with the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) loss to help mitigate the overoptimization towards undesired responses, for which we name the algorithm Regularized Preference Optimization (RPO). Experiments of aligning LLMs demonstrate the improved performance of RPO compared with DPO baselines. Our work sheds light on the interplay between preference optimization and SFT in tuning LLMs with both theoretical guarantees and empirical evidence.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by The Thirty-Eighth Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems. 31 pages, 7 figures</p></details> |

This remains one of the most used clinical tests to this day. Despite the swinging flashlight test's straightforward approach, a number of factors can add variability into the clinical methodology and reduce the measurement's validity and reliability. This includes small and poorly responsive pupils, dark iris, anisocoria, uneven illumination in both eyes. Due to these limitations, the true condition of relative afferent asymmetry may create confusion and various observers may quantify the relative afferent pupillary defect differently. Consequently, the results of the swinging flashlight test are subjective and ambiguous. In order to eliminate the limitations of traditional swinging flashlight test and introduce objectivity, we propose a novel approach to the swinging flashlight exam, VR-SFT, by making use of virtual reality (VR). We suggest that the clinical records of the subjects and the results of VR-SFT are comparable. In this paper, we describe how we exploit the features of immersive VR experience to create a reliable and objective swinging flashlight test.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inter...</summary><p>International Symposium on Visual Computing</p></details> |

However, despite the widespread use of policy gradient methods to train large language models for single turn tasks (e.g., question answering), value-based methods for multi-turn RL in an off-policy or offline setting have proven particularly challenging to scale to the setting of large language models. This setting requires effectively leveraging pretraining, scaling to large architectures with billions of parameters, and training on large datasets, all of which represent major challenges for current value-based RL methods. In this work, we propose a novel offline RL algorithm that addresses these drawbacks, casting Q-learning as a modified supervised fine-tuning (SFT) problem where the probabilities of tokens directly translate to Q-values. In this way we obtain an algorithm that smoothly transitions from maximizing the likelihood of the data during pretraining to learning a near-optimal Q-function during finetuning. Our algorithm has strong theoretical foundations, enjoying performance bounds similar to state-of-the-art Q-learning methods, while in practice utilizing an objective that closely resembles SFT. Because of this, our approach can enjoy the full benefits of the pretraining of language models, without the need to reinitialize any weights before RL finetuning, and without the need to initialize new heads for predicting values or advantages. Empirically, we evaluate our method on both pretrained LLMs and VLMs, on a variety of tasks including both natural language dialogue and robotic manipulation and navigation from images.</p></details> | 17 pages, 4 figures |

This limitation has motivated a growing interest in unsupervised paradigms as a third stage of post-training after SFT and RL. While recent efforts have explored this direction, their methods are complex and difficult to iterate. To address this, we propose MM-UPT, a simple yet effective framework for unsupervised post-training of MLLMs, enabling continual self-improvement without any external supervision. The training method of MM-UPT builds upon GRPO, replacing traditional reward signals with a self-rewarding mechanism based on majority voting over multiple sampled responses. Our experiments demonstrate that such training method effectively improves the reasoning ability of Qwen2.5-VL-7B (e.g., 66.3\%$\rightarrow$72.9\% on MathVista, 62.9\%$\rightarrow$68.7\% on We-Math), using standard dataset without ground truth labels. To further explore scalability, we extend our framework to a data self-generation setting, designing two strategies that prompt the MLLM to synthesize new training samples on its own. Additional experiments show that combining these synthetic data with the unsupervised training method can also boost performance, highlighting a promising approach for scalable self-improvement. Overall, MM-UPT offers a new paradigm for autonomous enhancement of MLLMs, serving as a critical third step after initial SFT and RL in the absence of external supervision.

However, existing quality-first paradigms often overlook valuable signals in discarded low-quality data and rely on imperfect quality filters. We introduce ENTP (Enhancing low-quality SFT data via Neural-symbolic Text Purge-Mix), a framework that revitalizes low-quality corpora through symbolic purification and neural reconstruction. The symbolic module identifies and prunes noisy samples based on statistical priors, while the neural component synthesizes enriched instruction-response pairs by leveraging latent representations and model knowledge. This neural-symbolic synergy enhances data informativeness and diversity. Experiments show that ENTP-augmented datasets, constructed exclusively from low-quality data, outperform 13 established data-selection baselines across five instruction-following benchmarks, and even surpass fine-tuning on the full original dataset (approximately 300K examples). Our results highlight the untapped potential of low-quality data and underscore the importance of intelligent purification and synthesis for efficient instruction alignment.</p></details> |  |

To account for the ill-posed nature of the setting, existing methods use deformation models with statistical, neural, or physical priors. They also predominantly rely on nonadaptive discrete surface representations (e.g. polygonal meshes), perform frame-by-frame optimisation leading to error propagation, and suffer from poor gradients of the mesh-based differentiable renderers. Consequently, fine surface details such as cloth wrinkles are often not recovered with the desired accuracy. In response to these limitations, we propose ThinShell-SfT, a new method for non-rigid 3D tracking that represents a surface as an implicit and continuous spatiotemporal neural field. We incorporate continuous thin shell physics prior based on the Kirchhoff-Love model for spatial regularisation, which starkly contrasts the discretised alternatives of earlier works. Lastly, we leverage 3D Gaussian splatting to differentiably render the surface into image space and optimise the deformations based on analysis-bysynthesis principles. Our Thin-Shell-SfT outperforms prior works qualitatively and quantitatively thanks to our continuous surface formulation in conjunction with a specially tailored simulation prior and surface-induced 3D Gaussians.

Through careful exploration of training and inference optimization, we demonstrate that: 1) with only 0.5B parameters, our model can generate 1024x1024 resolution images with high fidelity, and achieve competitive results on challenging text-to-image benchmarks, e.g., 0.59 on GenEval and 79.66 on DPG; 2) both supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) training could lead to significant improvements on generation aesthectics and prompt alignment; and 3) when optimized with inference acceleraton techniques like vLLM, the time for SimpleAR to generate an 1024x1024 image could be reduced to around 14 seconds. By sharing these findings and open-sourcing the code, we hope to reveal the potential of autoregressive visual generation and encourage more participation in this research field.

However, as the number of cascades increases, the improvements in reconstruction tend to become marginal, indicating possible excess model capacity. Knowledge distillation (KD) is an emerging technique to compress these models, in which a trained deep teacher network is used to distill knowledge to a smaller student network such that the student learns to mimic the behavior of the teacher. Most KD methods focus on effectively training the student with a pre-trained teacher unaware of the student model. We propose SFT-KD-Recon, a student-friendly teacher training approach along with the student as a prior step to KD to make the teacher aware of the structure and capacity of the student and enable aligning the representations of the teacher with the student. In SFT, the teacher is jointly trained with the unfolded branch configurations of the student blocks using three loss terms - teacher-reconstruction loss, student-reconstruction loss, and teacher-student imitation loss, followed by KD of the student. We perform extensive experiments for MRI acceleration in 4x and 5x under-sampling on the brain and cardiac datasets on five KD methods using the proposed approach as a prior step. We consider the DC-CNN architecture and setup teacher as D5C5 (141765 parameters), and student as D3C5 (49285 parameters), denoting a compression of 2.87:1. Results show that (i) our approach consistently improves the KD methods with improved reconstruction performance and image quality, and (ii) the student distilled using our approach is competitive with the teacher, with the performance gap reduced from 0.53 dB to 0.03 dB.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 8 figures.

It typically consists of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) stages. However, RLHF faces inherent limitations stemming from a complex training setup and its tendency to align the model with implicit values that end users cannot control at run-time. Moreover, reward models in RLHF stage commonly rely on single-dimensional feedback as opposed to explicit, multifaceted signals that indicate attributes such as helpfulness, humor, and toxicity. To address these limitations, we propose SteerLM, a supervised fine-tuning method that empowers end-users to control responses during inference. SteerLM conditions responses to conform to an explicitly defined multi-dimensional set of attributes, thereby empowering a steerable AI capable of generating helpful and high-quality responses while maintaining customizability. Experiments show that SteerLM trained on open source datasets generates responses that are preferred by human and automatic evaluators to many state-of-the-art baselines trained with RLHF while being much easier to train.

Prompt-as-Policy over Knowledge Graphs for Cold-start Next POI Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.08012v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Next point-of-interest (POI) recommendation is crucial for smart urban services such as tourism, dining, and transportation, yet most approaches struggle under cold-start conditions where user-POI interactions are sparse. Recent efforts leveraging large language models (LLMs) address this challenge through either supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or in-context learning (ICL). However, SFT demands costly annotations and fails to generalize to inactive users, while static prompts in ICL cannot adapt to diverse user contexts. To overcome these limitations, we propose Prompt-as-Policy over knowledge graphs, a reinforcement-guided prompting framework that learns to construct prompts dynamically through contextual bandit optimization. Our method treats prompt construction as a learnable policy that adaptively determines (i) which relational evidences to include, (ii) the number of evidence per candidate, and (iii) their organization and ordering within prompts. More specifically, we construct a knowledge graph (KG) to discover candidates and mine relational paths, which are transformed into evidence cards that summarize rationales for each candidate POI. The frozen LLM then acts as a reasoning engine, generating recommendations from the KG-discovered candidate set based on the policy-optimized prompts. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that Prompt-as-Policy consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving average 7.7\% relative improvements in Acc@1 for inactive users, while maintaining competitive performance on active users, without requiring model fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose SOAEsV2-7B/72B, a specialized LLM series developed via a three-phase framework: 1) continual pre-training integrates domain knowledge while retaining base capabilities; 2) domain-progressive SFT employs curriculum-based learning strategy, transitioning from weakly relevant conversational data to expert-annotated SOAEs datasets to optimize domain-specific tasks; 3) distillation-enhanced speculative decoding accelerates inference via logit distillation between 72B target and 7B draft models, achieving 1.39-1.52$\times$ speedup without quality loss. Experimental results demonstrate that our domain-specific pre-training phase maintains 99.8% of original general language capabilities while significantly improving domain performance, resulting in a 1.08$\times$ improvement in Rouge-1 score and a 1.17$\times$ enhancement in BLEU-4 score. Ablation studies further show that domain-progressive SFT outperforms single-stage training, achieving 1.02$\times$ improvement in Rouge-1 and 1.06$\times$ in BLEU-4. Our work introduces a comprehensive, full-pipeline approach for optimizing SOAEs LLMs, bridging the gap between general language capabilities and domain-specific expertise.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods largely follow image-domain paradigms and are mainly developed on small-scale models (approximately 2B parameters), limiting their ability to address the unique challenges of video tasks, such as costly data construction, unstable training, and heavy memory consumption. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a GT-Pair that automatically builds high-quality preference pairs by using real videos as positives and model-generated videos as negatives, eliminating the need for any external annotation. We further present Reg-DPO, which incorporates the SFT loss as a regularization term into the DPO loss to enhance training stability and generation fidelity. Additionally, by combining the FSDP framework with multiple memory optimization techniques, our approach achieves nearly three times higher training capacity than using FSDP alone. Extensive experiments on both I2V and T2V tasks across multiple datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing approaches, delivering superior video generation quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper is withdrawn due to the need for further revision and verification of experimental results.

Composing this vector with a target language model yields a Target Guard Model (TGM). We then adapt TGM with a streaming-aware approach that combines prefix-based training and evaluation with a classifier that produces a single-token output. With this composition alone, TGM improves classification quality over established Guard Models across standard safety suites and enables language extensibility to Chinese, Japanese, and Korean, requiring neither additional training nor target language labels. It also demonstrates model portability across two widely used public guardrail backbones, Llama and Gemma. With prefix SFT (supervised fine-tuning), TGM preserves classification quality under streaming by aligning the behavior between prefix inputs and full-text inputs. The single-token output design increases throughput and reduces latency. Together, these components reduce data and compute requirements while promoting streaming-aware evaluation practices, thereby contributing to a more responsible AI ecosystem.</p></details> |  |

While existing KV cache optimizations improve memory efficiency, they often fail to reduce time to first token (TTFT) and may degrade performance through token pruning. Alternative sequence modeling architectures address some of these limitations, but typically require full retraining and lack infrastructure support. EdgeInfinite offers an efficient solution by fine-tuning only a small subset of parameters, maintaining quality while reducing both computational and memory costs, including improved TTFT. However, its instruction-following ability is limited, and it lacks mobile-specific optimizations. To address these issues, we propose EdgeInfinite-Instruct, which introduces a Segmented Supervised Fine-Tuning (S-SFT) strategy tailored to long-sequence tasks such as summarization and question answering. We further optimized EdgeInfinite-Instruct for efficient deployment on edge NPUs by employing fine-grained post-training quantization (PTQ) to reduce computational demands while maintaining accuracy, and by implementing a fixed-shape computation graph that balances memory usage and on-device efficiency through scenario-specific customization of input token and cache sizes.

However, due to the substantial differences between remote sensing images and conventional optical images, these models face considerable challenges in comprehension, especially in detection tasks. Directly prompting VLMs with detection instructions often leads to unsatisfactory results. To address this issue, this letter explores the application of VLMs for object detection in remote sensing images. Specifically, we constructed supervised fine-tuning (SFT) datasets using publicly available remote sensing object detection datasets, including SSDD, HRSID, and NWPU-VHR-10. In these new datasets, we converted annotation information into JSON-compliant natural language descriptions, facilitating more effective understanding and training for the VLM. We then evaluate the detection performance of various fine-tuning strategies for VLMs and derive optimized model weights for object detection in remote sensing images. Finally, we evaluate the model's prior knowledge capabilities using natural language queries. Experimental results demonstrate that, without modifying the model architecture, remote sensing object detection can be effectively achieved using natural language alone. Additionally, the model exhibits the ability to perform certain vision question answering (VQA) tasks. Our datasets and related code will be released soon.</p></details> |  |

We address this practical reliability gap by creating PureTC-1B, a three-stage stabilization pipeline for Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct (an open-weight, instruction-tuned model released by Meta) using parameter-efficient LoRA adapters. Our method combines Continual Pre-Training (CPT) on TC-centric corpora, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with instruction data, and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) using TC-adherence preferences to improve monolingual robustness without full-model retraining. On a benchmark designed to simulate real-world usage, PureTC-1B achieves a 51.3% relative reduction (micro-average) in non-TC output tokens versus the base model. On a Named Entity Translation (NET) task, PureTC-1B further reduces incorrect-language tokens by 77.2% relative to Llama-3B and 57.2% relative to Qwen-1.5B, indicating that robust TC adherence is attainable even at the 1B scale.

The state-of-the-art, MaxMin-RLHF, addresses this by learning group-specific reward models, and by optimizing for the group receiving the minimum reward, thereby promoting fairness. However, we identify that a key limitation of MaxMin-RLHF is its poor performance when the minimum-reward group is a minority. To mitigate this drawback, we introduce a novel framework, termed {\em SharedRep-RLHF}. At its core, SharedRep-RLHF learns and leverages {\em shared traits} in annotations among various groups, in contrast to learning separate reward models across groups. We first show that MaxMin-RLHF is provably suboptimal in learning shared traits, and then quantify the sample complexity of SharedRep-RLHF. Experiments across diverse natural language tasks showcase the effectiveness of SharedRep-RLHF compared to MaxMin-RLHF with a gain of up to 20% in win rate.</p></details> |  |

However, existing open-source RLHF projects are still largely confined to the offline learning setting. In this technical report, we aim to fill in this gap and provide a detailed recipe that is easy to reproduce for online iterative RLHF. In particular, since online human feedback is usually infeasible for open-source communities with limited resources, we start by constructing preference models using a diverse set of open-source datasets and use the constructed proxy preference model to approximate human feedback. Then, we discuss the theoretical insights and algorithmic principles behind online iterative RLHF, followed by a detailed practical implementation. Our trained LLM achieves impressive performance on LLM chatbot benchmarks, including AlpacaEval-2, Arena-Hard, and MT-Bench, as well as other academic benchmarks such as HumanEval and TruthfulQA. We have shown that supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and iterative RLHF can obtain state-of-the-art performance with fully open-source datasets. Further, we have made our models, curated datasets, and comprehensive step-by-step code guidebooks publicly available.

Social choice theory's analysis of settings such as voting mechanisms provides technical infrastructure that can inform how to aggregate human preferences amid disagreement.

| **[Measuring memorization in RLHF for code completion](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.11715v2)** | 2024-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) has become the dominant method to align large models to user preferences. Unlike fine-tuning, for which there are many studies regarding training data memorization, it is not clear how memorization is affected by or introduced in the RLHF alignment process. Understanding this relationship is important as real user data may be collected and used to align large models; if user data is memorized during RLHF and later regurgitated, this could raise privacy concerns. In addition to RLHF, other methods such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and $Ψ$PO have gained popularity for learning directly from human preferences, removing the need for optimizing intermediary reward models with reinforcement learning. In this work, we analyze how training data memorization can surface and propagate through each phase of RLHF and direct preference learning. We focus our study on code completion models, as code completion is one of the most popular use cases for large language models. We find that RLHF significantly decreases the chance that data used for reward modeling and reinforcement learning is memorized in comparison to directly fine-tuning on this data, but that examples already memorized during the fine-tuning stage of RLHF, will, in the majority of cases, remain memorized after RLHF. In contrast, we find that aligning by learning directly from human preference data via a special case of $Ψ$PO, Identity Preference Optimization (IPO), increases the likelihood that training data is regurgitated compared to RLHF. Our work suggests that RLHF, as opposed to direct preference learning, is a safer way to mitigate the risk of regurgitating sensitive preference data when aligning large language models. We find our conclusions are robust across multiple code completion datasets, tasks, and model scales.</p></details> |  |
| **[HybridFlow: A Flexible and Efficient RLHF Framework](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.19256v2)** | 2024-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is widely used in Large Language Model (LLM) alignment. Traditional RL can be modeled as a dataflow, where each node represents computation of a neural network (NN) and each edge denotes data dependencies between the NNs. RLHF complicates the dataflow by expanding each node into a distributed LLM training or generation program, and each edge into a many-to-many multicast. Traditional RL frameworks execute the dataflow using a single controller to instruct both intra-node computation and inter-node communication, which can be inefficient in RLHF due to large control dispatch overhead for distributed intra-node computation. Existing RLHF systems adopt a multi-controller paradigm, which can be inflexible due to nesting distributed computation and data communication. We propose HybridFlow, which combines single-controller and multi-controller paradigms in a hybrid manner to enable flexible representation and efficient execution of the RLHF dataflow. We carefully design a set of hierarchical APIs that decouple and encapsulate computation and data dependencies in the complex RLHF dataflow, allowing efficient operation orchestration to implement RLHF algorithms and flexible mapping of the computation onto various devices. We further design a 3D-HybridEngine for efficient actor model resharding between training and generation phases, with zero memory redundancy and significantly reduced communication overhead. Our experimental results demonstrate 1.53$\times$~20.57$\times$ throughput improvement when running various RLHF algorithms using HybridFlow, as compared with state-of-the-art baselines.

| **[Reward Model Overoptimisation in Iterated RLHF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.18126v2)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is a widely used method for aligning large language models with human preferences. However, RLHF often suffers from reward model overoptimisation, in which models overfit to the reward function, resulting in non-generalisable policies that exploit the idiosyncrasies and peculiarities of the reward function. A common mitigation is iterated RLHF, in which reward models are repeatedly retrained with updated human feedback and policies are re-optimised. Despite its increasing adoption, the dynamics of overoptimisation in this setting remain poorly understood. In this work, we present the first comprehensive study of overoptimisation in iterated RLHF. We systematically analyse key design choices - how reward model training data is transferred across iterations, which reward function is used for optimisation, and how policies are initialised. Using the controlled AlpacaFarm benchmark, we observe that overoptimisation tends to decrease over successive iterations, as reward models increasingly approximate ground-truth preferences. However, performance gains diminish over time, and while reinitialising from the base policy is robust, it limits optimisation flexibility. Other initialisation strategies often fail to recover from early overoptimisation. These findings offer actionable insights for building more stable and generalisable RLHF pipelines.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 17 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

These platforms enable users to fine-tune models without requiring any expertise in developing complex machine learning algorithms. While these platforms offer useful features such as reward modeling and RLHF fine-tuning, their security and reliability remain largely unexplored. Given the growing adoption of RLHF and open-source RLHF frameworks, we investigate the trustworthiness of these systems and their potential impact on behavior of LLMs. In this paper, we present an attack targeting publicly available RLHF tools. In our proposed attack, an adversarial RLHF platform corrupts the LLM alignment process by selectively manipulating data samples in the preference dataset. In this scenario, when a user's task aligns with the attacker's objective, the platform manipulates a subset of the preference dataset that contains samples related to the attacker's target. This manipulation results in a corrupted reward model, which ultimately leads to the misalignment of the language model. Our results demonstrate that such an attack can effectively steer LLMs toward undesirable behaviors within the targeted domains. Our work highlights the critical need to explore the vulnerabilities of RLHF platforms and their potential to cause misalignment in LLMs during the RLHF fine-tuning process.</p></details> |  |

We explore two approaches that leverage human gaze modeling to enhance RLHF: (1) gaze-aware reward models and (2) gaze-based distribution of sparse rewards at token level. Our experiments demonstate that gaze-informed RLHF achieves faster convergence while maintaining or slightly improving performance, thus, reducing computational costs during policy optimization. These results show that human gaze provides a valuable and underused signal for policy optimization, pointing to a promising direction for improving RLHF efficiency.</p></details> |  |

However, RLHF often encounters significant memory challenges.

| **[Accelerating RLHF Training with Reward Variance Increase](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.23247v2)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is an essential technique for ensuring that large language models (LLMs) are aligned with human values and preferences during the post-training phase. As an effective RLHF approach, group relative policy optimization (GRPO) has demonstrated success in many LLM-based applications. However, efficient GRPO-based RLHF training remains a challenge. Recent studies reveal that a higher reward variance of the initial policy model leads to faster RLHF training. Inspired by this finding, we propose a practical reward adjustment model to accelerate RLHF training by provably increasing the reward variance and preserving the relative preferences and reward expectation. Our reward adjustment method inherently poses a nonconvex optimization problem, which is NP-hard to solve in general. To overcome the computational challenges, we design a novel $O(n \log n)$ algorithm to find a global solution of the nonconvex reward adjustment model by explicitly characterizing the extreme points of the feasible set. As an important application, we naturally integrate this reward adjustment model into the GRPO algorithm, leading to a more efficient GRPO with reward variance increase (GRPOVI) algorithm for RLHF training. As an interesting byproduct, we provide an indirect explanation for the empirical effectiveness of GRPO with rule-based reward for RLHF training, as demonstrated in DeepSeek-R1. Experiment results demonstrate that the GRPOVI algorithm can significantly improve the RLHF training efficiency compared to the original GRPO algorithm.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Adaptive Placement and Parallelism Framework for Accelerating RLHF Training](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.11819v3)** | 2024-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, ChatGPT or InstructGPT like large language models (LLM) has made a significant impact in the AI world. Many works have attempted to reproduce the complex InstructGPT's training pipeline, namely Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF). However, the mainstream distributed RLHF training methods typically adopt a fixed model placement strategy, referred to as the Co-located strategy. This strategy treats all four interdependent models involved in RLHF as a single entity, distributing them across all devices and applying parallelism techniques designed for a single model, regardless of the workload heterogeneity inherent to each model. As a result, this strategy exacerbates the generation bottlenecks in the RLHF training and degrades the overall training efficiency. To address these issues, we propose a flexible model placement framework that offers two general and agile model placement strategies. The Interleaving strategy helps reduce memory redundancy and communication costs of RLHF training by placing models without dependencies on exclusive devices with careful orchestration. On the other hand, the Disaggregated strategy improves the throughput of model training by separating the training and inference runtime of the RLHF pipeline with additional shadow models. Furthermore, our framework provides a simple user interface and guidelines to easily and flexibly configure these strategies in various training scenarios. Our experiments have shown that our strategy can achieve notable improvements up to 11x, compared to the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches. The results highlight the effectiveness and adaptability of our methods in accelerating the training of distributed RLHF.</p></details> |  |

We establish a close theoretical connection between reinforcement learning from human feedback RLHF and imitation learning (IL), revealing that RLHF implicitly performs imitation learning on the preference data distribution. Building on this connection, we propose DIL, a principled framework that directly optimizes the imitation learning objective. DIL provides a unified imitation learning perspective on alignment, encompassing existing alignment algorithms as special cases while naturally introducing new variants. By bridging IL and RLHF, DIL offers new insights into alignment with RLHF. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DIL outperforms existing methods on various challenging benchmarks.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

While existing RLHF training systems have enabled significant progress, they often face challenges in scaling to multi-modal and diffusion workflows and adapting to dynamic workloads. In particular, current approaches may encounter limitations in controller scalability, flexible resource placement, and efficient orchestration when handling complex RLHF pipelines, especially in scenarios involving dynamic sampling or generative reward modeling. In this paper, we present \textbf{G-Core}, a simple, scalable, and balanced RLHF training framework designed to address these challenges. G-Core introduces a parallel controller programming model, enabling flexible and efficient orchestration of complex RLHF workflows without the bottlenecks of a single centralized controller. Furthermore, we propose a dynamic placement schema that adaptively partitions resources and schedules workloads, significantly reducing hardware idle time and improving utilization, even under highly variable training conditions. G-Core has successfully trained models that support WeChat product features serving a large-scale user base, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness in real-world scenarios. Our results show that G-Core advances the state of the art in RLHF training, providing a solid foundation for future research and deployment of large-scale, human-aligned models.</p></details> | <details><summary>I hav...</summary><p>I haven't received company approval yet, and I uploaded it by mistake</p></details> |
| **[How to Evaluate Reward Models for RLHF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.14872v2)** | 2024-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a new benchmark for reward models that quantifies their ability to produce strong language models through RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback). The gold-standard approach is to run a full RLHF training pipeline and directly probe downstream LLM performance. However, this process is prohibitively expensive. To address this, we build a predictive model of downstream LLM performance by evaluating the reward model on proxy tasks. These proxy tasks consist of a large-scale human preference and a verifiable correctness preference dataset, in which we measure 12 metrics across 12 domains. To investigate which reward model metrics are most correlated to gold-standard RLHF outcomes, we launch an end-to-end RLHF experiment on a large-scale crowdsourced human preference platform to view real reward model downstream performance as ground truth. Ultimately, we compile our data and findings into Preference Proxy Evaluations (PPE), the first reward model benchmark explicitly linked to post-RLHF real-world human preference performance, which we open-source for public use and further development. Our code and evaluations can be found at https://github.com/lmarena/PPE .</p></details> |  |
| **[Does RLHF Scale? Exploring the Impacts From Data, Model, and Method](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.06000v1)** | 2024-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study explores the scaling properties of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) in Large Language Models (LLMs). Although RLHF is considered an important step in post-training of LLMs, its scaling potential is still largely unknown. We systematically analyze key components in the RLHF framework--model size, data composition, and inference budget--and their impacts on performance. Our findings show that increasing data diversity and volume improves reward model performance, helping process-supervision models scale better. For policy training, more response samples per prompt boost performance initially but quickly plateau. And larger reward models offer modest gains in policy training. In addition, larger policy models benefit less from RLHF with a fixed reward model. Overall, RLHF scales less efficiently than pretraining, with diminishing returns from additional computational resources. Based on these observations, we propose strategies to optimize RLHF performance within computational limits.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploration-Driven Policy Optimization in RLHF: Theoretical Insights on Efficient Data Utilization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10342v2)** | 2024-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has achieved impressive empirical successes while relying on a small amount of human feedback. However, there is limited theoretical justification for this phenomenon. Additionally, most recent studies focus on value-based algorithms despite the recent empirical successes of policy-based algorithms. In this work, we consider an RLHF algorithm based on policy optimization (PO-RLHF). The algorithm is based on the popular Policy Cover-Policy Gradient (PC-PG) algorithm, which assumes knowledge of the reward function. In PO-RLHF, knowledge of the reward function is not assumed, and the algorithm uses trajectory-based comparison feedback to infer the reward function. We provide performance bounds for PO-RLHF with low query complexity, which provides insight into why a small amount of human feedback may be sufficient to achieve good performance with RLHF. A key novelty is a trajectory-level elliptical potential analysis, which bounds the reward estimation error when comparison feedback (rather than numerical reward observation) is given. We provide and analyze algorithms PG-RLHF and NN-PG-RLHF for two settings: linear and neural function approximation, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Aligning to What? Limits to RLHF Based Alignment](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.09025v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is increasingly used to align large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. However, the effectiveness of RLHF in addressing underlying biases remains unclear. This study investigates the relationship between RLHF and both covert and overt biases in LLMs, particularly focusing on biases against African Americans. We applied various RLHF techniques (DPO, ORPO, and RLOO) to Llama 3 8B and evaluated the covert and overt biases of the resulting models using matched-guise probing and explicit bias testing. We performed additional tests with DPO on different base models and datasets; among several implications, we found that SFT before RLHF calcifies model biases. Additionally, we extend the tools for measuring biases to multi-modal models. Through our experiments we collect evidence that indicates that current alignment techniques are inadequate for nebulous tasks such as mitigating covert biases, highlighting the need for capable datasets, data curating techniques, or alignment tools.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sharp Analysis for KL-Regularized Contextual Bandits and RLHF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.04625v2)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reverse-Kullback-Leibler (KL) regularization has emerged to be a predominant technique used to enhance policy optimization in reinforcement learning (RL) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), which forces the learned policy to stay close to a reference policy. While the effectiveness and necessity of KL-regularization have been empirically demonstrated in various practical scenarios, current theoretical analysis of KL-regularized RLHF still obtains the same $\mathcal{O}(1 / ε^2)$ sample complexity as problems without KL-regularization. To understand the fundamental distinction between policy learning objectives with KL-regularization and ones without KL-regularization, we are the first to theoretically demonstrate the power of KL-regularization by providing a sharp analysis for KL-regularized contextual bandits and RLHF, revealing an $\mathcal{O}(1 / ε)$ sample complexity when $ε$ is sufficiently small. We further explore the role of data coverage in contextual bandits and RLHF. While the coverage assumption is commonly employed in offline RLHF to link the samples from the reference policy to the optimal policy, often at the cost of a multiplicative dependence on the coverage coefficient, its impact on the sample complexity of online RLHF remains unclear. Previous theoretical analyses of online RLHF typically require explicit exploration and additional structural assumptions on the reward function class. In contrast, we show that with sufficient coverage from the reference policy, a simple two-stage mixed sampling strategy can achieve a sample complexity with only an additive dependence on the coverage coefficient. Our results provide a comprehensive understanding of the roles of KL-regularization and data coverage in RLHF, shedding light on the design of more efficient RLHF algorithms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reward Difference Optimization For Sample Reweighting In Offline RLHF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.09385v2)** | 2024-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), aligning LLMs with human preferences become increasingly important. Although Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) proves effective, it is complicated and highly resource-intensive. As such, offline RLHF has been introduced as an alternative solution, which directly optimizes LLMs with ranking losses on a fixed preference dataset. Current offline RLHF only captures the "ordinal relationship" between responses, overlooking the crucial aspect of how much one is preferred over the others. To address this issue, we propose a simple yet effective solution called Reward Difference Optimization, shorted as RDO. Specifically, we introduce reward difference coefficients to reweigh sample pairs in offline RLHF. We then develop a difference model which captures rich interactions between a pair of responses for predicting these difference coefficients. Experiments with 7B LLMs on the HH and TL;DR datasets substantiate the effectiveness of our method in both automatic metrics and human evaluation, thereby highlighting its potential for aligning LLMs with human intent and values</p></details> | EMNLP 2024 findings |
| **[Mitigating the Alignment Tax of RLHF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.06256v4)** | 2024-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs acquire a wide range of abilities during pre-training, but aligning LLMs under Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) can lead to forgetting pretrained abilities, which is also known as the alignment tax. To investigate alignment tax, we conducted experiments with existing RLHF algorithms using OpenLLaMA-3B, which revealed a pronounced alignment tax in NLP tasks. Whereas, despite various techniques to mitigate forgetting, they are often at odds with the RLHF performance, leading to a trade-off between alignment performance and forgetting mitigation, leading to an alignment-forgetting trade-off. In this paper we show that model averaging, which simply interpolates between pre and post RLHF model weights, surprisingly achieves the most strongest alignment-forgetting Pareto front among a wide range of competing methods. To understand its effectiveness, we offer theoretical insights into model averaging, revealing that it enhances performance Pareto front by increasing feature diversity on the layers where tasks share overlapped feature spaces. Empirical evidence corroborates our analysis by showing the benefits of averaging low-level transformer layers. Building on the analysis and the observation that averaging different layers of the transformer leads to significantly different alignment-forgetting trade-offs, we propose Heterogeneous Model Averaging (HMA) to Heterogeneously find various combination ratios of model layers. HMA seeks to maximize the alignment performance while incurring minimal alignment tax. Moreover, we validate HMA's performance across a range of RLHF algorithms over OpenLLaMA-3B and further extend our findings to Mistral-7B which is evaluated by open-sourced preference model and GPT4.

| **[Continual SFT Matches Multimodal RLHF with Negative Supervision](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.14797v1)** | 2024-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal RLHF usually happens after supervised finetuning (SFT) stage to continually improve vision-language models' (VLMs) comprehension. Conventional wisdom holds its superiority over continual SFT during this preference alignment stage. In this paper, we observe that the inherent value of multimodal RLHF lies in its negative supervision, the logit of the rejected responses. We thus propose a novel negative supervised finetuning (nSFT) approach that fully excavates these information resided. Our nSFT disentangles this negative supervision in RLHF paradigm, and continually aligns VLMs with a simple SFT loss. This is more memory efficient than multimodal RLHF where 2 (e.g., DPO) or 4 (e.g., PPO) large VLMs are strictly required. The effectiveness of nSFT is rigorously proved by comparing it with various multimodal RLHF approaches, across different dataset sources, base VLMs and evaluation metrics. Besides, fruitful of ablations are provided to support our hypothesis. We hope this paper will stimulate further research to properly align large vision language models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient RLHF: Reducing the Memory Usage of PPO](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.00754v1)** | 2023-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) has revolutionized language modeling by aligning models with human preferences. However, the RL stage, Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), requires over 3x the memory of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), making it infeasible to use for most practitioners. To address this issue, we present a comprehensive analysis the memory usage, performance, and training time of memory-savings techniques for PPO. We introduce Hydra-RLHF by first integrating the SFT and Reward models and then dynamically turning LoRA "off" during training. Our experiments show: 1. Using LoRA during PPO reduces its memory usage to be smaller than SFT while improving alignment across four public benchmarks, and 2. Hydra-PPO reduces the latency per sample of LoRA-PPO by up to 65% while maintaining its performance. Our results demonstrate that Hydra-PPO is a simple and promising solution for enabling more widespread usage of RLHF.</p></details> |  |
| **[Understanding the Effects of RLHF on LLM Generalisation and Diversity](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.06452v3)** | 2024-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) fine-tuned with reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) have been used in some of the most widely deployed AI models to date, such as OpenAI's ChatGPT or Anthropic's Claude. While there has been significant work developing these methods, our understanding of the benefits and downsides of each stage in RLHF is still limited. To fill this gap, we present an extensive analysis of how each stage of the process (i.e. supervised fine-tuning (SFT), reward modelling, and RLHF) affects two key properties: out-of-distribution (OOD) generalisation and output diversity. OOD generalisation is crucial given the wide range of real-world scenarios in which these models are being used, while output diversity refers to the model's ability to generate varied outputs and is important for a variety of use cases. We perform our analysis across two base models on both summarisation and instruction following tasks, the latter being highly relevant for current LLM use cases. We find that RLHF generalises better than SFT to new inputs, particularly as the distribution shift between train and test becomes larger. However, RLHF significantly reduces output diversity compared to SFT across a variety of measures, implying a tradeoff in current LLM fine-tuning methods between generalisation and diversity. Our results provide guidance on which fine-tuning method should be used depending on the application, and show that more research is needed to improve the tradeoff between generalisation and diversity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available here: https://github.com/facebookresearch/rlfh-gen-div</p></details> |
| **[Policy-labeled Preference Learning: Is Preference Enough for RLHF?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.06273v2)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To design rewards that align with human goals, Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a prominent technique for learning reward functions from human preferences and optimizing policies via reinforcement learning algorithms. However, existing RLHF methods often misinterpret trajectories as being generated by an optimal policy, causing inaccurate likelihood estimation and suboptimal learning. Inspired by Direct Preference Optimization framework which directly learns optimal policy without explicit reward, we propose policy-labeled preference learning (PPL), to resolve likelihood mismatch issues by modeling human preferences with regret, which reflects behavior policy information. We also provide a contrastive KL regularization, derived from regret-based principles, to enhance RLHF in sequential decision making. Experiments in high-dimensional continuous control tasks demonstrate PPL's significant improvements in offline RLHF performance and its effectiveness in online settings.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we present the ChatGLM-RLHF pipeline -- a reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) system -- designed to enhance ChatGLM's alignment with human preferences. ChatGLM-RLHF encompasses three major components: the collection of human preference data, the training of the reward model, and the optimization of policies. Throughout the process of integrating ChatGLM-RLHF into production, we encountered and addressed several unprecedented challenges. We introduce the strategies to mitigate reward variance for stabilized large-scale training, implement model parallelism with fused gradient-descent, and design regularization constraints to avoid catastrophic forgetting in LLMs. Experiments show that ChatGLM-RLHF brings significant improvements in alignment tasks compared to the supervised fine-tuned (SFT) version of ChatGLM. For instance, it achieves on average 15\% more wins against ChatGLM-SFT in Chinese alignment tasks. The work presents our practices of aligning LLMs with human preferences, offering insights into the challenges and solutions in RLHF implementations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reward-Robust RLHF in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.15360v3)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to progress toward more advanced forms of intelligence, Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is increasingly seen as a key pathway toward achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). However, the reliance on reward-model-based (RM-based) alignment methods introduces significant challenges due to the inherent instability and imperfections of Reward Models (RMs), which can lead to critical issues such as reward hacking and misalignment with human intentions. In this paper, we introduce a reward-robust RLHF framework aimed at addressing these fundamental challenges, paving the way for more reliable and resilient learning in LLMs. Our approach introduces a novel optimization objective that carefully balances performance and robustness by incorporating Bayesian Reward Model Ensembles (BRME) to model the uncertainty set of reward functions. This allows the framework to integrate both nominal performance and minimum reward signals, ensuring more stable learning even with imperfect RMs. Empirical results demonstrate that our framework consistently outperforms baselines across diverse benchmarks, showing improved accuracy and long-term stability. We also provide a theoretical analysis, demonstrating that reward-robust RLHF approaches the stability of constant reward settings, which proves to be acceptable even in a stochastic-case analysis. Together, these contributions highlight the framework potential to enhance both the performance and stability of LLM alignment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reward Generalization in RLHF: A Topological Perspective](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10184v7)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing alignment methods share a common topology of information flow, where reward information is collected from humans, modeled with preference learning, and used to tune language models. However, this shared topology has not been systematically characterized, nor have its alternatives been thoroughly explored, leaving the problems of low data efficiency and unreliable generalization unaddressed. As a solution, we introduce a theory of reward generalization in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), focusing on the topology of information flow at both macro and micro levels. At the macro level, we portray the RLHF information flow as an autoencoding process over behavior distributions, formalizing the RLHF objective of distributional consistency between human preference and model behavior. At the micro level, we present induced Bayesian networks to model the impact of dataset topologies on reward generalization. Combining analysis on both levels, we propose reward modeling from tree-structured preference information. It is shown to reduce reward uncertainty by up to $Θ(\log n/\log\log n)$ times compared to baselines, where $n$ is the dataset size. Validation on three NLP tasks shows that it achieves an average win rate of 65% against baselines, thus improving reward generalization for free via topology design, while reducing the amount of data requiring annotation.</p></details> | <details><summary>46 pa...</summary><p>46 pages, ACL 2025 (Findings)</p></details> |
| **[Value Imprint: A Technique for Auditing the Human Values Embedded in RLHF Datasets](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.11937v1)** | 2024-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs are increasingly fine-tuned using RLHF datasets to align them with human preferences and values. However, very limited research has investigated which specific human values are operationalized through these datasets. In this paper, we introduce Value Imprint, a framework for auditing and classifying the human values embedded within RLHF datasets. To investigate the viability of this framework, we conducted three case study experiments by auditing the Anthropic/hh-rlhf, OpenAI WebGPT Comparisons, and Alpaca GPT-4-LLM datasets to examine the human values embedded within them. Our analysis involved a two-phase process. During the first phase, we developed a taxonomy of human values through an integrated review of prior works from philosophy, axiology, and ethics. Then, we applied this taxonomy to annotate 6,501 RLHF preferences. During the second phase, we employed the labels generated from the annotation as ground truth data for training a transformer-based machine learning model to audit and classify the three RLHF datasets. Through this approach, we discovered that information-utility values, including Wisdom/Knowledge and Information Seeking, were the most dominant human values within all three RLHF datasets. In contrast, prosocial and democratic values, including Well-being, Justice, and Human/Animal Rights, were the least represented human values. These findings have significant implications for developing language models that align with societal values and norms. We contribute our datasets to support further research in this area.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Hidden Link Between RLHF and Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.22578v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human values has recently garnered significant attention, with prominent examples including the canonical yet costly Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and the simple Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). In this work, we demonstrate that both RLHF and DPO can be interpreted from the perspective of mutual information (MI) maximization, uncovering a profound connection to contrastive learning. Within this framework, both RLHF and DPO can be interpreted as methods that performing contrastive learning based on the positive and negative samples derived from base model, leveraging the Donsker-Varadhan (DV) lower bound on MI (equivalently, the MINE estimator). Such paradigm further illuminates why RLHF may not intrinsically incentivize reasoning capacities in LLMs beyond what is already present in the base model. Building on the perspective, we replace the DV/MINE bound with the Jensen-Shannon (JS) MI estimator and propose the Mutual Information Optimization (MIO). Comprehensive theoretical analysis and extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that MIO mitigates the late-stage decline in chosen-likelihood observed in DPO, achieving competitive or superior performance across various challenging reasoning and mathematical benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Language Models Learn to Mislead Humans via RLHF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.12822v3)** | 2024-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language models (LMs) can produce errors that are hard to detect for humans, especially when the task is complex. RLHF, the most popular post-training method, may exacerbate this problem: to achieve higher rewards, LMs might get better at convincing humans that they are right even when they are wrong. We study this phenomenon under a standard RLHF pipeline, calling it "U-SOPHISTRY" since it is Unintended by model developers. Specifically, we ask time-constrained (e.g., 3-10 minutes) human subjects to evaluate the correctness of model outputs and calculate humans' accuracy against gold labels. On a question-answering task (QuALITY) and programming task (APPS), RLHF makes LMs better at convincing our subjects but not at completing the task correctly. RLHF also makes the model harder to evaluate: our subjects' false positive rate increases by 24.1% on QuALITY and 18.3% on APPS. Finally, we show that probing, a state-of-the-art approach for detecting Intended Sophistry (e.g. backdoored LMs), does not generalize to U-SOPHISTRY. Our results highlight an important failure mode of RLHF and call for more research in assisting humans to align them.</p></details> |  |
| **[ROCM: RLHF on consistency models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06171v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have revolutionized generative modeling in continuous domains like image, audio, and video synthesis. However, their iterative sampling process leads to slow generation and inefficient training, challenges that are further exacerbated when incorporating Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) due to sparse rewards and long time horizons. Consistency models address these issues by enabling single-step or efficient multi-step generation, significantly reducing computational costs. In this work, we propose a direct reward optimization framework for applying RLHF to consistency models, incorporating distributional regularization to enhance training stability and prevent reward hacking. We investigate various $f$-divergences as regularization strategies, striking a balance between reward maximization and model consistency. Unlike policy gradient methods, our approach leverages first-order gradients, making it more efficient and less sensitive to hyperparameter tuning. Empirical results show that our method achieves competitive or superior performance compared to policy gradient based RLHF methods, across various automatic metrics and human evaluation. Additionally, our analysis demonstrates the impact of different regularization techniques in improving model generalization and preventing overfitting.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Long Way to Go: Investigating Length Correlations in RLHF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.03716v2)** | 2024-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Great success has been reported using Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) to align large language models, with open preference datasets enabling wider experimentation, particularly for "helpfulness" in tasks like dialogue and web question answering. Alongside these improvements, however, RLHF also often drives models to produce longer outputs. This paper demonstrates, on three diverse settings, that optimizing for response length is, much more than previously thought, a significant factor behind RLHF. Studying the strategies RL optimization uses to maximize reward, we find improvements in reward to largely be driven by increasing response length, instead of other features. Indeed, we find that even a purely length-based reward reproduces most downstream RLHF improvements over supervised fine-tuned models. Testing a comprehensive set of length-countering interventions, we identify the dominant source of these biases to be reward models, which, by studying training dynamics, we find are non-robust and easily influenced by length biases in preference data.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 13 figures, Accepted to COLM 2024</p></details> |
| **[The Trickle-down Impact of Reward (In-)consistency on RLHF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.16155v1)** | 2023-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Standard practice within Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) involves optimizing against a Reward Model (RM), which itself is trained to reflect human preferences for desirable generations. A notable subject that is understudied is the (in-)consistency of RMs -- whether they can recognize the semantic changes to different prompts and appropriately adapt their reward assignments -- and their impact on the downstream RLHF model. In this paper, we visit a series of research questions relevant to RM inconsistency: (1) How can we measure the consistency of reward models? (2) How consistent are the existing RMs and how can we improve them? (3) In what ways does reward inconsistency influence the chatbots resulting from the RLHF model training? We propose Contrast Instructions -- a benchmarking strategy for the consistency of RM. Each example in Contrast Instructions features a pair of lexically similar instructions with different ground truth responses. A consistent RM is expected to rank the corresponding instruction and response higher than other combinations. We observe that current RMs trained with the standard ranking objective fail miserably on Contrast Instructions compared to average humans. To show that RM consistency can be improved efficiently without using extra training budget, we propose two techniques ConvexDA and RewardFusion, which enhance reward consistency through extrapolation during the RM training and inference stage, respectively. We show that RLHF models trained with a more consistent RM yield more useful responses, suggesting that reward inconsistency exhibits a trickle-down effect on the downstream RLHF process.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Perfect Blend: Redefining RLHF with Mixture of Judges](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.20370v1)** | 2024-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has become the leading approach for fine-tuning large language models (LLM). However, RLHF has limitations in multi-task learning (MTL) due to challenges of reward hacking and extreme multi-objective optimization (i.e., trade-off of multiple and/or sometimes conflicting objectives). Applying RLHF for MTL currently requires careful tuning of the weights for reward model and data combinations. This is often done via human intuition and does not generalize. In this work, we introduce a novel post-training paradigm which we called Constrained Generative Policy Optimization (CGPO). The core of CGPO is Mixture of Judges (MoJ) with cost-efficient constrained policy optimization with stratification, which can identify the perfect blend in RLHF in a principled manner. It shows strong empirical results with theoretical guarantees, does not require extensive hyper-parameter tuning, and is plug-and-play in common post-training pipelines. Together, this can detect and mitigate reward hacking behaviors while reaching a pareto-optimal point across an extremely large number of objectives. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that CGPO significantly outperforms standard RLHF algorithms like PPO and DPO across various tasks including general chat, STEM questions, instruction following, and coding. Specifically, CGPO shows improvements of 7.4% in AlpacaEval-2 (general chat), 12.5% in Arena-Hard (STEM & reasoning), and consistent gains in other domains like math and coding. Notably, PPO, while commonly used, is prone to severe reward hacking in popular coding benchmarks, which CGPO successfully addresses. This breakthrough in RLHF not only tackles reward hacking and extreme multi-objective optimization challenges but also advances the state-of-the-art in aligning general-purpose LLMs for diverse applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to conference</p></details> |
| **[RLHF Deciphered: A Critical Analysis of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback for LLMs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.08555v2)** | 2024-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) have become indispensable tools for various tasks. However, training LLMs to serve as effective assistants for humans requires careful consideration. A promising approach is reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), which leverages human feedback to update the model in accordance with human preferences and mitigate issues like toxicity and hallucinations. Yet, an understanding of RLHF for LLMs is largely entangled with initial design choices that popularized the method and current research focuses on augmenting those choices rather than fundamentally improving the framework. In this paper, we analyze RLHF through the lens of reinforcement learning principles to develop an understanding of its fundamentals, dedicating substantial focus to the core component of RLHF -- the reward model. Our study investigates modeling choices, caveats of function approximation, and their implications on RLHF training algorithms, highlighting the underlying assumptions made about the expressivity of reward. Our analysis improves the understanding of the role of reward models and methods for their training, concurrently revealing limitations of the current methodology. We characterize these limitations, including incorrect generalization, model misspecification, and the sparsity of feedback, along with their impact on the performance of a language model. The discussion and analysis are substantiated by a categorical review of current literature, serving as a reference for researchers and practitioners to understand the challenges of RLHF and build upon existing efforts.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Shared Low-Rank Adaptation Approach to Personalized RLHF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19201v1)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a pivotal technique for aligning artificial intelligence systems with human values, achieving remarkable success in fine-tuning large language models. However, existing RLHF frameworks often assume that human preferences are relatively homogeneous and can be captured by a single, unified reward model. This assumption overlooks the inherent diversity and heterogeneity across individuals, limiting the adaptability of RLHF to personalized scenarios and risking misalignments that can diminish user satisfaction and trust in AI systems. In this paper, we address these challenges by introducing Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) into the personalized RLHF framework. We apply LoRA in the the aggregated parameter space of all personalized reward functions, thereby enabling efficient learning of personalized reward models from potentially limited local datasets. Our approach exploits potential shared structures among the local ground-truth reward models while allowing for individual adaptation, without relying on restrictive assumptions about shared representations as in prior works. We further establish sample complexity guarantees for our method. Theoretical analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach in capturing both shared and individual-specific structures within heterogeneous human preferences, addressing the dual challenge of personalization requirements and practical data constraints. Experimental results on real-world datasets corroborate the efficiency of our algorithm in the personalized RLHF setting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at AISTATS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Greedy Sampling Is Provably Efficient for RLHF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.24700v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a key technique for post-training large language models. Despite its empirical success, the theoretical understanding of RLHF is still limited, as learning the KL-regularized target with only preference feedback poses additional challenges compared with canonical RL. Existing works mostly study the reward-based Bradley-Terry (BT) preference model, and extend classical designs utilizing optimism or pessimism. This work, instead, considers the general preference model (whose practical relevance has been observed recently) and obtains performance guarantees with major, order-wise improvements over existing ones. Surprisingly, these results are derived from algorithms that directly use the empirical estimates (i.e., greedy sampling), as opposed to constructing optimistic or pessimistic estimates in previous works. This insight has a deep root in the unique structural property of the optimal policy class under the KL-regularized target, and we further specialize it to the BT model, highlighting the surprising sufficiency of greedy sampling in RLHF.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |
| **[MA-RLHF: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback with Macro Actions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.02743v2)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has demonstrated effectiveness in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. However, token-level RLHF suffers from the credit assignment problem over long sequences, where delayed rewards make it challenging for the model to discern which actions contributed to preferred outcomes. This hinders learning efficiency and slows convergence.In this paper, we propose MA-RLHF, a simple yet effective RLHF framework that incorporates macro actions -- sequences of tokens or higher-level language constructs -- into the learning process. By operating at higher level of abstraction, our approach reduces the temporal distance between actions and rewards, facilitating faster and more accurate credit assignment. This results in more stable policy gradient estimates and enhances learning efficiency within each episode, all without increasing computational complexity during training or inference. We validate our approach through extensive experiments across various model sizes and tasks, including text summarization, dialogue generation, question answering, and program synthesis. Our method achieves substantial performance improvements over standard RLHF, with performance gains of up to 30% in text summarization and code generation, 18% in dialogue, and 8% in question answering tasks. Notably, our approach reaches parity with vanilla RLHF 1.7 ~ 2 times faster in terms of training time and continues to outperform it with further training. We make our code and data publicly available at https://github.com/ernie-research/MA-RLHF.</p></details> |  |
| **[Aligning Large Multimodal Models with Factually Augmented RLHF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.14525v1)** | 2023-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Multimodal Models (LMM) are built across modalities and the misalignment between two modalities can result in "hallucination", generating textual outputs that are not grounded by the multimodal information in context. To address the multimodal misalignment issue, we adapt the Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) from the text domain to the task of vision-language alignment, where human annotators are asked to compare two responses and pinpoint the more hallucinated one, and the vision-language model is trained to maximize the simulated human rewards. We propose a new alignment algorithm called Factually Augmented RLHF that augments the reward model with additional factual information such as image captions and ground-truth multi-choice options, which alleviates the reward hacking phenomenon in RLHF and further improves the performance. We also enhance the GPT-4-generated training data (for vision instruction tuning) with previously available human-written image-text pairs to improve the general capabilities of our model. To evaluate the proposed approach in real-world scenarios, we develop a new evaluation benchmark MMHAL-BENCH with a special focus on penalizing hallucinations. As the first LMM trained with RLHF, our approach achieves remarkable improvement on the LLaVA-Bench dataset with the 94% performance level of the text-only GPT-4 (while previous best methods can only achieve the 87% level), and an improvement by 60% on MMHAL-BENCH over other baselines. We opensource our code, model, data at https://llava-rlhf.github.io.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Simplify RLHF as Reward-Weighted SFT: A Variational Method](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.11026v2)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is crucial for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human values. However, RLHF has been continuously challenged by its high complexity in implementation and computation consumption. Even with recent simplifications, such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Advantage Leftover Lunch (A-LoL), the problems of over-fitting and training instability remain hindering the alignment process from the expected optimal performance. To address the existing challenges, we propose a novel simplification of RLHF from the perspective of variational inference, called $\textbf{V}$ariational $\textbf{A}$lignment with $\textbf{R}$e-weighting ($\textbf{VAR}$). More specifically, by directly minimizing the distribution gap between the learning LLM policy and the optimal solution of RLHF, we transform the alignment objective into a reward-driven re-weighted supervised fine-tuning (SFT) form, which only requires minor adjustment on the SFT loss to obtain noticeable improvement on training stability and effectiveness. On comprehensive alignment and generation benchmarks, our VAR method has numerically achieved competitive performance in LLM alignment helpfulness and harmlessness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Proxy-RLHF: Decoupling Generation and Alignment in Large Language Model with Proxy](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.04283v1)** | 2024-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is the prevailing approach to ensure Large Language Models (LLMs) align with human values. However, existing RLHF methods require a high computational cost, one main reason being that RLHF assigns both the generation and alignment tasks to the LLM simultaneously. In this paper, we introduce Proxy-RLHF, which decouples the generation and alignment processes of LLMs, achieving alignment with human values at a much lower computational cost. We start with a novel Markov Decision Process (MDP) designed for the alignment process and employ Reinforcement Learning (RL) to train a streamlined proxy model that oversees the token generation of the LLM, without altering the LLM itself. Experiments show that our method achieves a comparable level of alignment with only 1\% of the training parameters of other methods.</p></details> |  |

| **[Thompson Sampling in Online RLHF with General Function Approximation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.23927v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has achieved great empirical success in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preference, and it is of great importance to study the statistical efficiency of RLHF algorithms from a theoretical perspective. In this work, we consider the online RLHF setting where the preference data is revealed during the learning process and study action value function approximation. We design a model-free posterior sampling algorithm for online RLHF inspired by Thompson sampling and provide its theoretical guarantee. Specifically, we adopt Bellman eluder (BE) dimension as the complexity measure of the function class and establish $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret bound for the proposed algorithm with other multiplicative factor depending on the horizon, BE dimension and the $log$-bracketing number of the function class. Further, in the analysis, we first establish the concentration-type inequality of the squared Bellman error bound based on the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) generalization bound, which plays the crucial rules in obtaining the eluder-type regret bound and may be of independent interest.</p></details> |  |
| **[BadReward: Clean-Label Poisoning of Reward Models in Text-to-Image RLHF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.03234v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is crucial for aligning text-to-image (T2I) models with human preferences. However, RLHF's feedback mechanism also opens new pathways for adversaries. This paper demonstrates the feasibility of hijacking T2I models by poisoning a small fraction of preference data with natural-appearing examples. Specifically, we propose BadReward, a stealthy clean-label poisoning attack targeting the reward model in multi-modal RLHF. BadReward operates by inducing feature collisions between visually contradicted preference data instances, thereby corrupting the reward model and indirectly compromising the T2I model's integrity. Unlike existing alignment poisoning techniques focused on single (text) modality, BadReward is independent of the preference annotation process, enhancing its stealth and practical threat. Extensive experiments on popular T2I models show that BadReward can consistently guide the generation towards improper outputs, such as biased or violent imagery, for targeted concepts. Our findings underscore the amplified threat landscape for RLHF in multi-modal systems, highlighting the urgent need for robust defenses. Disclaimer.

To solve this problem, alignment techniques such as RLHF, DPO and KTO are proposed. However, these alignment techniques have limitations. For example, RLHF requires training the reward model and policy separately, which is complex, time-consuming, memory intensive and unstable during training processes. DPO proposes a mapping between an optimal policy and a reward, greatly simplifying the training process of RLHF. However, it can not take full advantages of a reward model and it is limited to pairwise preference data. In this paper, we propose \textbf{UN}ified \textbf{A}lignment (UNA) which unifies RLHF/PPO, DPO and KTO. Firstly, we mathematically prove that given the classical RLHF objective, the optimal policy is induced by a generalize implicit reward function. With this novel mapping between a reward model and an optimal policy, UNA can 1. unify RLHF/PPO, DPO and KTO into a supervised learning of minimizing the difference between an implicit reward and an explicit reward; 2. outperform RLHF/PPO while simplify, stabilize, speed up and reduce memory burden of RL fine-tuning process; 3. accommodate different feedback types including pairwise, binary and scalar feedback. Downstream experiments show UNA outperforms DPO, KTO and RLHF.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Federated RLHF with Aggregated Client Preference for LLMs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.03038v3)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) fine-tunes a pretrained large language model (LLM) using user preference data, enabling it to generate content aligned with human preferences. However, due to privacy concerns, users may be reluctant to share sensitive preference data. To address this, we propose utilizing Federated Learning (FL) techniques, allowing large-scale preference collection from diverse real-world users without requiring them to transmit data to a central server. Our federated RLHF methods (i.e., FedBis and FedBiscuit) encode each client's preferences into binary selectors and aggregate them to capture common preferences. In particular, FedBiscuit overcomes key challenges, such as preference heterogeneity and reward hacking, through innovative solutions like grouping clients with similar preferences to reduce heterogeneity and using multiple binary selectors to enhance LLM output quality. To evaluate the performance of the proposed methods, we establish the first federated RLHF benchmark with a heterogeneous human preference dataset. Experimental results show that by integrating the LLM with aggregated client preferences, FedBis and FedBiscuit significantly enhance the professionalism and readability of the generated content.</p></details> | ICLR'25 |

Our study decomposes this gap into two sources: an explicit representation gap under exact optimization and an implicit representation gap under finite samples. In the exact optimization setting, we characterize how the relative capacities of the reward and policy model classes influence the final policy qualities. We show that RLHF, DPO, or online DPO can outperform one another depending on type of model mis-specifications. Notably, online DPO can outperform both RLHF and standard DPO when the reward and policy model classes are isomorphic and both mis-specified. In the approximate optimization setting, we provide a concrete construction where the ground-truth reward is implicitly sparse and show that RLHF requires significantly fewer samples than DPO to recover an effective reward model -- highlighting a statistical advantage of two-stage learning. Together, these results provide a comprehensive understanding of the performance gap between RLHF and DPO under various settings, and offer practical insights into when each method is preferred.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 5 figures.

However, the inherent tension between the objectives of helpfulness and harmlessness presents a significant challenge during LLM training. To address this issue, we propose Safe Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (Safe RLHF), a novel algorithm for human value alignment. Safe RLHF explicitly decouples human preferences regarding helpfulness and harmlessness, effectively avoiding the crowdworkers' confusion about the tension and allowing us to train separate reward and cost models. We formalize the safety concern of LLMs as an optimization task of maximizing the reward function while satisfying specified cost constraints. Leveraging the Lagrangian method to solve this constrained problem, Safe RLHF dynamically adjusts the balance between the two objectives during fine-tuning. Through a three-round fine-tuning using Safe RLHF, we demonstrate a superior ability to mitigate harmful responses while enhancing model performance compared to existing value-aligned algorithms. Experimentally, we fine-tuned the Alpaca-7B using Safe RLHF and aligned it with collected human preferences, significantly improving its helpfulness and harmlessness according to human evaluations.</p></details> |  |

This challenge is characterized by various instabilities, such as reward hacking and catastrophic forgetting. In this technical report, we propose two innovations to stabilize RLHF training: 1) Advantage Model, which directly models advantage score i.e., extra reward compared to the expected rewards and regulates score distributions across tasks to prevent reward hacking. 2) Selective Rehearsal, which mitigates catastrophic forgetting by strategically selecting data for PPO training and knowledge rehearsing. Our experimental analysis on public and proprietary datasets reveals that the proposed methods not only increase stability in RLHF training but also achieve higher reward scores and win rates.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, working in progress</p></details> |

It is crucial to consider diverse human feedback types and various learning methods in different environments. However, quantifying progress in RLHF with diverse feedback is challenging due to the lack of standardized annotation platforms and widely used unified benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we introduce Uni-RLHF, a comprehensive system implementation tailored for RLHF. It aims to provide a complete workflow from real human feedback, fostering progress in the development of practical problems. Uni-RLHF contains three packages: 1) a universal multi-feedback annotation platform, 2) large-scale crowdsourced feedback datasets, and 3) modular offline RLHF baseline implementations. Uni-RLHF develops a user-friendly annotation interface tailored to various feedback types, compatible with a wide range of mainstream RL environments. We then establish a systematic pipeline of crowdsourced annotations, resulting in large-scale annotated datasets comprising more than 15 million steps across 30+ popular tasks. Through extensive experiments, the results in the collected datasets demonstrate competitive performance compared to those from well-designed manual rewards. We evaluate various design choices and offer insights into their strengths and potential areas of improvement.

| **[Solving the Inverse Alignment Problem for Efficient RLHF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.10529v1)** | 2024-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Collecting high-quality preference datasets for reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is resource-intensive and challenging. As a result, researchers often train reward models on extensive offline datasets which aggregate diverse generation sources and scoring/alignment policies. We hypothesize that this aggregation has an averaging effect on reward model scores, which limits signal and impairs the alignment process. Inspired by the field of inverse RL, we define the 'inverse alignment problem' in language model training, where our objective is to optimize the critic's reward for a fixed actor and a fixed offline preference dataset. We hypothesize that solving the inverse alignment problem will improve reward model quality by providing clearer feedback on the policy's current behavior. To that end, we investigate whether repeatedly fine-tuning a reward model on subsets of the offline preference dataset aligned with a periodically frozen policy during RLHF improves upon vanilla RLHF. Our empirical results demonstrate that this approach facilitates superior alignment and faster convergence compared to using an unaligned or out-of-distribution reward model relative to the LLM policy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sequence to Sequence Reward Modeling: Improving RLHF by Language Feedback](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.00162v1)** | 2024-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aligning the behavior of Large language models (LLMs) with human intentions and values remains a critical challenge. Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) aligns LLMs by training a reward model (RM) on human preferences and fine-tuning the LLMs to maximize RM feedback. Despite its effectiveness and popularity, RLHF is prone to biased local optimization. It means RM fails to provide feedback that accurately aligns with human preference, causing LLMs to explore unexpected generalizations, and failing to achieve alignment objectives. To mitigate this issue, we propose a novel \textit{sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) reward modeling} method. Its key insight is that learning from language feedback rather than scalar feedback improves RLHF without additional annotations. We replaced the reward modeling target from binary maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) with sequence MLE. This method enables richer and fine-grained language feedback without additional annotations, models, or training stages. Our experiments demonstrated its effectiveness, specifically, reducing the refusal-to-response paradigm in single-turn safety dialogues and the long-response bias in text summarization tasks. We provide further analysis that seq2seq RM improves RLHF performance across 2B and 7B LLMs on 3 NLP tasks, achieving an average win rate of 76.9\%. We further show that seq2seq RM can still improve the performance of RLHF under out-of-distribution prompts.</p></details> | 7 pages |

Traditional RLHF methods rely on a fixed dataset, which often suffers from limited coverage. To this end, online RLHF has emerged as a promising direction, enabling iterative data collection and refinement. Despite its potential, this paradigm faces a key bottleneck: the requirement to continuously integrate new data into the dataset and re-optimize the model from scratch at each iteration, resulting in computational and storage costs that grow linearly with the number of iterations. In this work, we address this challenge by proposing a one-pass reward modeling method that eliminates the need to store historical data and achieves constant-time updates per iteration. Specifically, we first formalize RLHF as a contextual preference bandit and develop a new algorithm based on online mirror descent with a tailored local norm, replacing the standard maximum likelihood estimation for reward modeling. We then apply it to various online RLHF settings, including passive data collection, active data collection, and deployment-time adaptation. We provide theoretical guarantees showing that our method enhances both statistical and computational efficiency. Finally, we design practical algorithms for LLMs and conduct experiments with the Llama-3-8B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct models on Ultrafeedback and Mixture2 datasets, validating the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025; The first two authors contributed equally</p></details> |

Depending on the availability of preference data, both online and offline RLHF are active areas of investigation. A key bottleneck is understanding how to incorporate uncertainty estimation in the reward function learned from the preference data for RLHF, regardless of how the preference data is collected. While the principles of optimism or pessimism under uncertainty are well-established in standard reinforcement learning (RL), a practically-implementable and theoretically-grounded form amenable to large language models is not yet available, as standard techniques for constructing confidence intervals become intractable under arbitrary policy parameterizations. In this paper, we introduce a unified approach to online and offline RLHF -- value-incentivized preference optimization (VPO) -- which regularizes the maximum-likelihood estimate of the reward function with the corresponding value function, modulated by a $\textit{sign}$ to indicate whether the optimism or pessimism is chosen. VPO also directly optimizes the policy with implicit reward modeling, and therefore shares a simpler RLHF pipeline similar to direct preference optimization. Theoretical guarantees of VPO are provided for both online and offline settings, matching the rates of their standard RL counterparts. Moreover, experiments on text summarization and dialog verify the practicality and effectiveness of VPO.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |
| **[A Unified Pairwise Framework for RLHF: Bridging Generative Reward Modeling and Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.04950v1)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a important paradigm for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences during post-training. This framework typically involves two stages: first, training a reward model on human preference data, followed by optimizing the language model using reinforcement learning algorithms. However, current RLHF approaches may constrained by two limitations. First, existing RLHF frameworks often rely on Bradley-Terry models to assign scalar rewards based on pairwise comparisons of individual responses. However, this approach imposes significant challenges on reward model (RM), as the inherent variability in prompt-response pairs across different contexts demands robust calibration capabilities from the RM. Second, reward models are typically initialized from generative foundation models, such as pre-trained or supervised fine-tuned models, despite the fact that reward models perform discriminative tasks, creating a mismatch. This paper introduces Pairwise-RL, a RLHF framework that addresses these challenges through a combination of generative reward modeling and a pairwise proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm. Pairwise-RL unifies reward model training and its application during reinforcement learning within a consistent pairwise paradigm, leveraging generative modeling techniques to enhance reward model performance and score calibration. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that Pairwise-RL outperforms traditional RLHF frameworks across both internal evaluation datasets and standard public benchmarks, underscoring its effectiveness in improving alignment and model behavior.</p></details> | 11oages,2 figures |

In the offline setting, we design an algorithm based on the principle of pessimism and derive a new suboptimality gap of $\tilde{O}(1/[(e^ε-1)^2 n])$ on the KL-regularized objective under single-policy concentrability. We also prove its optimality by providing a matching lower bound where $n$ is the sample size. In the online setting, we are the first one to theoretically investigate the problem of KL-regularized RLHF with LDP. We design an optimism-based algorithm and derive a logarithmic regret bound of $O(d_{\mathcal{F}}\log (N_{\mathcal{F}}\cdot T) /(e^ε-1)^2 )$, where $T$ is the total time step, $N_{\mathcal{F}}$ is cardinality of the reward function space $\mathcal{F}$ and $d_{\mathcal{F}}$ is a variant of eluder dimension for RLHF. As a by-product of our analysis, our results also imply the first analysis for online KL-regularized RLHF without privacy. We implement our algorithm in the offline setting to verify our theoretical results and release our open source code at: https://github.com/rushil-thareja/PPKL-RLHF-Official.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Descriptive and Normative Theory of Human Beliefs in RLHF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.01692v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human preferences in RLHF are typically modeled as a function of the human's reward function or corresponding optimal state-action values. In this work, we propose that human beliefs about the capabilities of the agent being trained also play a key role in preference generation. We examine two questions related to this hypothesis, one descriptive and one normative, respectively: Do human labelers' beliefs about agent capabilities affect the preferences that they provide? And what is the ideal set of beliefs about an agent -- and resulting preferences -- for humans to have? We propose a new preference model that incorporates human beliefs and provide a normative theory that bounds the error on the final learned policy based on the \textit{mismatch} between the human's beliefs and an idealized set of beliefs. We then confirm via a human study that beliefs about agent capabilities do, in fact, significantly affect preferences and can be influenced through simple interventions. Additionally, we empirically show through synthetic experiments that it is often suboptimal for human preference labelers to assume agent optimality. Collectively, these results theoretically and empirically demonstrate how reducing the mismatch between human beliefs and agent capabilities can lead to more performant RLHF and point toward new best practices for RLHF practitioners.</p></details> |  |
| **[On The Global Convergence Of Online RLHF With Neural Parametrization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.15610v2)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The importance of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values cannot be overstated. RLHF is a three-stage process that includes supervised fine-tuning (SFT), reward learning, and policy learning. Although there are several offline and online approaches to aligning LLMs, they often suffer from distribution shift issues. These issues arise from the inability to accurately capture the distributional interdependence between the reward learning and policy learning stages. Consequently, this has led to various approximated approaches, but the theoretical insights and motivations remain largely limited to tabular settings, which do not hold in practice. This gap between theoretical insights and practical implementations is critical. It is challenging to address this gap as it requires analyzing the performance of AI alignment algorithms in neural network-parameterized settings. Although bi-level formulations have shown promise in addressing distribution shift issues, they suffer from the hyper-gradient problem, and current approaches lack efficient algorithms to solve this. In this work, we tackle these challenges employing the bi-level formulation laid out in Kwon et al. (2024) along with the assumption \emph{Weak Gradient Domination} to demonstrate convergence in an RLHF setup, obtaining a sample complexity of $ε^{-\frac{7}{2}}$ . Our key contributions are twofold: (i) We propose a bi-level formulation for AI alignment in parameterized settings and introduce a first-order approach to solve this problem. (ii) We analyze the theoretical convergence rates of the proposed algorithm and derive state-of-the-art bounds. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to establish convergence rate bounds and global optimality for the RLHF framework in neural network-parameterized settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>The u...</summary><p>The updated version of this paper is arXiv:2503.17644</p></details> |

To reduce harmful outputs, produces and vendors of LLMs have used reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF). In tandem, LLM vendors have been increasingly enabling fine-tuning of their most powerful models. However, concurrent work has shown that fine-tuning can remove RLHF protections. We may expect that the most powerful models currently available (GPT-4) are less susceptible to fine-tuning attacks. In this work, we show the contrary: fine-tuning allows attackers to remove RLHF protections with as few as 340 examples and a 95% success rate. These training examples can be automatically generated with weaker models. We further show that removing RLHF protections does not decrease usefulness on non-censored outputs, providing evidence that our fine-tuning strategy does not decrease usefulness despite using weaker models to generate training data. Our results show the need for further research on protections on LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NAACL 2024. (7 pages)</p></details> |
| **[It Takes Two: On the Seamlessness between Reward and Policy Model in RLHF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.07971v2)** | 2024-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) involves training policy models (PMs) and reward models (RMs) to align language models with human preferences. Instead of focusing solely on PMs and RMs independently, we propose to examine their interactions during fine-tuning, introducing the concept of seamlessness. Our study starts with observing the saturation phenomenon, where continual improvements in RM and PM do not translate into RLHF progress. Our analysis shows that RMs fail to assign proper scores to PM responses, resulting in a 35% mismatch rate with human preferences, highlighting a significant discrepancy between PM and RM. To measure seamlessness between PM and RM without human effort, we propose an automatic metric, SEAM. SEAM quantifies the discrepancies between PM and RM judgments induced by data samples. We validate the effectiveness of SEAM in data selection and model augmentation. Our experiments demonstrate that (1) using SEAM-filtered data for RL training improves RLHF performance by 4.5%, and (2) SEAM-guided model augmentation results in a 4% performance improvement over standard augmentation methods.</p></details> |  |

However, existing frameworks commonly face challenges such as inference bottlenecks and complexity barriers, which restrict their accessibility to newcomers. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{OpenRLHF}, a user-friendly, scalable, and easy-to-learn open-source RLHF framework built upon Ray, vLLM, DeepSpeed, and HuggingFace Transformers, featuring a simplified design, clear code structure, and comprehensive documentation to facilitate entry for researchers and practitioners. Experimental results show that OpenRLHF achieves superior training efficiency, with speedups ranging from 1.22x to 1.68x across different model sizes, compared to state-of-the-art frameworks. Additionally, it requires significantly fewer lines of code for implementation. OpenRLHF is publicly available at https://github.com/OpenRLHF/OpenRLHF, and has already been adopted by leading institutions to accelerate RLHF research and learning.</p></details> | update template |
| **[A Theoretical Framework for Partially Observed Reward-States in RLHF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.03282v3)** | 2024-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing deployment of reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) calls for a deeper theoretical investigation of its underlying models. The prevalent models of RLHF do not account for neuroscience-backed, partially-observed "internal states" that can affect human feedback, nor do they accommodate intermediate feedback during an interaction. Both of these can be instrumental in speeding up learning and improving alignment. To address these limitations, we model RLHF as reinforcement learning with partially observed reward-states (PORRL). We accommodate two kinds of feedback $-$ cardinal and dueling feedback. We first demonstrate that PORRL subsumes a wide class of RL problems, including traditional RL, RLHF, and reward machines. For cardinal feedback, we present two model-based methods (POR-UCRL, POR-UCBVI). We give both cardinal regret and sample complexity guarantees for the methods, showing that they improve over naive history-summarization. We then discuss the benefits of a model-free method like GOLF with naive history-summarization in settings with recursive internal states and dense intermediate feedback. For this purpose, we define a new history aware version of the Bellman-eluder dimension and give a new guarantee for GOLF in our setting, which can be exponentially sharper in illustrative examples. For dueling feedback, we show that a naive reduction to cardinal feedback fails to achieve sublinear dueling regret. We then present the first explicit reduction that converts guarantees for cardinal regret to dueling regret. In both feedback settings, we show that our models and guarantees generalize and extend existing ones.</p></details> | <details><summary>64 pa...</summary><p>64 pages. 14 pages for main paper, 50 pages for references + appendix</p></details> |
| **[Asynchronous RLHF: Faster and More Efficient Off-Policy RL for Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.18252v3)** | 2025-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The dominant paradigm for RLHF is online and on-policy RL: synchronously generating from the large language model (LLM) policy, labelling with a reward model, and learning using feedback on the LLM's own outputs. While performant, this paradigm is computationally inefficient. Inspired by classical deep RL literature, we propose separating generation and learning in RLHF. This enables asynchronous generation of new samples while simultaneously training on old samples, leading to faster training and more compute-optimal scaling. However, asynchronous training relies on an underexplored regime, online but off-policy RLHF: learning on samples from previous iterations of our model which give a worse training signal. We tackle the fundamental challenge in this regime: how much off-policyness can we tolerate for asynchronous training to speed up learning but maintain performance? Among several RLHF algorithms we test, online DPO is found to be most robust to off-policy data, and robustness increases with the scale of the policy model. We study further compute optimizations for asynchronous RLHF but find that they come at a performance cost, giving rise to a trade-off. We verify the scalability of asynchronous RLHF by training a general-purpose chatbot from LLaMA 3.1 8B on an instruction-following task ~40% faster than a synchronous run while matching final performance. Finally, we extend our results to math and reasoning to demonstrate asynchronous RL can finetune Rho 1B on GSM8k ~70% faster while matching synchronous accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted at ICLR 2025, code at https://github.com/mnoukhov/async_rlhf, integrated into the open-instruct library https://github.com/allenai/open-instruct</p></details> |
| **[Theoretical Tensions in RLHF: Reconciling Empirical Success with Inconsistencies in Social Choice Theory](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.12350v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite its empirical success, Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has been shown to violate almost all the fundamental axioms in social choice theory -- such as majority consistency, pairwise majority consistency, and Condorcet consistency. This raises a foundational question: why does RLHF perform so well in practice if it fails these seemingly essential properties? In this paper, we resolve this paradox by showing that under mild and empirically plausible assumptions on the preference profile, RLHF does satisfy pairwise majority and Condorcet consistency. These assumptions are frequently satisfied in real-world alignment tasks, offering a theoretical explanation for RLHF's strong practical performance. Furthermore, we show that a slight modification to the reward modeling objective can ensure pairwise majority or Condorcet consistency even under general preference profiles, thereby improving the alignment process. Finally, we go beyond classical axioms in economic and social choice theory and introduce new alignment criteria -- preference matching, preference equivalence, and group preference matching -- that better reflect the goal of learning distributions over responses. We show that while RLHF satisfies the first two properties, it fails to satisfy the third. We conclude by discussing how future alignment methods may be designed to satisfy all three.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reward Shaping to Mitigate Reward Hacking in RLHF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.18770v3)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is essential for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values. However, RLHF is susceptible to \emph{reward hacking}, where the agent exploits flaws in the reward function rather than learning the intended behavior, thus degrading alignment. Although reward shaping helps stabilize RLHF and partially mitigate reward hacking, a systematic investigation into shaping techniques and their underlying principles remains lacking. To bridge this gap, we present a comprehensive study of the prevalent reward shaping methods. Our analysis suggests two key design principles: (1) the RL reward should be bounded, and (2) the RL reward benefits from rapid initial growth followed by gradual convergence. Guided by these insights, we propose Preference As Reward (PAR), a novel approach that leverages the latent preferences embedded within the reward model as the signal for reinforcement learning. We evaluated PAR on two base models, Gemma2-2B, and Llama3-8B, using two datasets, Ultrafeedback-Binarized and HH-RLHF. Experimental results demonstrate PAR's superior performance over other reward shaping methods. On the AlpacaEval 2.0 benchmark, PAR achieves a win rate of at least 5 percentage points higher than competing approaches. Furthermore, PAR exhibits remarkable data efficiency, requiring only a single reference reward for optimal performance, and maintains robustness against reward hacking even after two full epochs of training. The code is available at https://github.com/PorUna-byte/PAR, and the Work done during the internship at StepFun by Jiayi Fu.</p></details> | 24 pages |

However, the systematic study of learning from diverse types of feedback is held back by limited standardized tooling available to researchers. To bridge this gap, we propose RLHF-Blender, a configurable, interactive interface for learning from human feedback. RLHF-Blender provides a modular experimentation framework and implementation that enables researchers to systematically investigate the properties and qualities of human feedback for reward learning. The system facilitates the exploration of various feedback types, including demonstrations, rankings, comparisons, and natural language instructions, as well as studies considering the impact of human factors on their effectiveness. We discuss a set of concrete research opportunities enabled by RLHF-Blender. More information is available at https://rlhfblender.info/.</p></details> | 14 pages, 3 figures |
| **[ReaL: Efficient RLHF Training of Large Language Models with Parameter Reallocation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.14088v2)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is a pivotal technique for empowering large language model (LLM) applications. Compared with the supervised training process of LLMs, the RLHF training process is much more sophisticated, requiring a diverse range of computation workloads with intricate dependencies between multiple LLM instances. Therefore, simply adopting the fixed parallelization strategies from supervised training for LLMs can be insufficient for RLHF and result in low training efficiency. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel technique named parameter ReaLlocation, which dynamically adapts the parallelization strategies for different workloads during training by redistributing LLM parameters across the training cluster. Building upon this idea, we introduce ReaL, a pioneering system for efficient RLHF training. ReaL introduces the concept of an execution plan, which defines a fine-grained resource allocation and parallelization strategy particularly designed for RLHF training. Based on this concept, ReaL employs a tailored search algorithm with a lightweight run-time estimator to automatically discover an efficient execution plan for an instance of RLHF experiment. Subsequently, the runtime engine deploys the selected plan by effectively parallelizing computations and redistributing parameters. We evaluate ReaL on the LLaMA models with up to 70 billion parameters and 128 GPUs. The experimental results demonstrate that ReaL achieves speedups of up to $3.58\times$ compared to baseline methods. Furthermore, the execution plans generated by ReaL exhibit an average of $81\%$ performance improvement over heuristic approaches based on Megatron-LM in the long-context scenario. The source code of ReaL is publicly available at https://github.com/openpsi-project/ReaLHF .</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages (20 pages with references and the appendix), 17 figures.

Due to the intrinsic nature of RLHF training, i.e., the data skewness in the generation stage and the pipeline bubbles in the training stage, existing RLHF systems suffer from low GPU utilization. RLHFuse breaks the traditional view of RLHF workflow as a composition of individual tasks, splitting each task into finer-grained subtasks, and performing stage fusion to improve GPU utilization. RLHFuse contains two key ideas. First, for generation and inference tasks, RLHFuse splits them into sample-level subtasks, enabling efficient inter-stage fusion to overlap the execution of generation and inference stages, thus mitigating the original generation bottleneck dominated by long-tailed samples. Second, for training tasks, RLHFuse breaks them into subtasks of micro-batches and performs intra-stage fusion to concurrently execute these subtasks in the training stage with a fused pipeline schedule, effectively mitigating the pipeline bubbles. The experiments show that RLHFuse increases the training throughput by up to $3.7\times$, compared to existing systems.</p></details> |  |

We introduce Federated Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (FedRLHF), a novel framework that decentralizes the RLHF process. FedRLHF enables collaborative policy learning across multiple clients without necessitating the sharing of raw data or human feedback, thereby ensuring robust privacy preservation. Leveraging federated reinforcement learning, each client integrates human feedback locally into their reward functions and updates their policies through personalized RLHF processes. We establish rigorous theoretical foundations for FedRLHF, providing convergence guarantees, and deriving sample complexity bounds that scale efficiently with the number of clients. Empirical evaluations on the MovieLens and IMDb datasets demonstrate that FedRLHF not only preserves user privacy but also achieves performance on par with centralized RLHF, while enhancing personalization across diverse client environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Updated for AAMAS 2025 camera-ready.

Prior RLHF works typically take a bandit formulation, which, though intuitive, ignores the sequential nature of LM generation and can suffer from the sparse reward issue. While recent works propose dense token-level RLHF, treating each token as an action may be oversubtle to proper reward assignment. In this paper, we seek to get the best of both by training and utilizing a segment-level reward model, which assigns a reward to each semantically complete text segment that spans over a short sequence of tokens. For reward learning, our method allows dynamic text segmentation and compatibility with standard sequence-preference datasets. For effective RL-based LM training against segment reward, we generalize the classical scalar bandit reward normalizers into location-aware normalizer functions and interpolate the segment reward for further densification. With these designs, our method performs competitively on three popular RLHF benchmarks for LM policy: AlpacaEval 2.0, Arena-Hard, and MT-Bench. Ablation studies are conducted to further demonstrate our method.</p></details> |  |

Traditional score-only reward models for alignment suffer from low accuracy, weak generalization, and poor interpretability, blocking the progress of alignment methods, e.g., reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Generative reward models (GRMs) leverage MLLMs' intrinsic reasoning capabilities to discriminate pair-wise responses, but their pair-wise paradigm makes it hard to generalize to learnable rewards. We introduce Generative RLHF-V, a novel alignment framework that integrates GRMs with multi-modal RLHF. We propose a two-stage pipeline: $\textbf{multi-modal generative reward modeling from RL}$, where RL guides GRMs to actively capture human intention, then predict the correct pair-wise scores; and $\textbf{RL optimization from grouped comparison}$, which enhances multi-modal RL scoring precision by grouped responses comparison. Experimental results demonstrate that, besides out-of-distribution generalization of RM discrimination, our framework improves 4 MLLMs' performance across 7 benchmarks by $18.1\%$, while the baseline RLHF is only $5.3\%$. We further validate that Generative RLHF-V achieves a near-linear improvement with an increasing number of candidate responses. Our code and models can be found at https://generative-rlhf-v.github.io.</p></details> | 9 pages, 8 figures |

RLHF requires a large number of preference pairs as training data, which are often used in both the Supervised Fine-Tuning and Reward Model training and therefore publicly available datasets are commonly used. In this work, we study to what extent a malicious actor can manipulate the LMs generations by poisoning the preferences, i.e., injecting poisonous preference pairs into these datasets and the RLHF training process. We propose strategies to build poisonous preference pairs and test their performance by poisoning two widely used preference datasets. Our results show that preference poisoning is highly effective: injecting a small amount of poisonous data (1-5\% of the original dataset), we can effectively manipulate the LM to generate a target entity in a target sentiment (positive or negative). The findings from our experiments also shed light on strategies to defend against the preference poisoning attack.</p></details> |  |

We observe that expressions of satisfaction and dissatisfaction follow stable linguistic patterns across users, indicating that more informative supervisory signals can be extracted from free-form feedback. Building on this insight, we introduce Adaptive Reward-Following (ARF), which converts natural feedback into continuous preference trajectories and optimizes them using the novel TraceBias algorithm. Across diverse LLMs and preference domains, ARF consistently outperforms PPO and DPO, improving alignment by up to 7.6%. Our results demonstrate that continuous reward modeling provides a scalable path toward personalized and theoretically grounded RLHF.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This version fixes some minor typographical errors and adds more explanations to ensure clarity in presentation</p></details> |

Traditional reward modeling techniques in RLHF train an imperfect reward model, on which a KL regularization plays a pivotal role in mitigating reward hacking when optimizing a policy. Such an intuition-based method still suffers from reward hacking, and the policies with large KL divergence from the dataset distribution are excluded during learning. In contrast, we show that when optimizing a policy on a pessimistic reward model fine-tuned through PET, reward hacking can be prevented without relying on any regularization. We test our methods on the standard TL;DR summarization dataset. We find that one can learn a high-quality policy on our pessimistic reward without using any regularization. Such a policy has a high KL divergence from the dataset distribution while having high performance in practice. In summary, our work shows the feasibility of learning a pessimistic reward model against reward hacking. The agent can greedily search for the policy with a high pessimistic reward without suffering from reward hacking.</p></details> |  |

It typically consists of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) stages. However, RLHF faces inherent limitations stemming from a complex training setup and its tendency to align the model with implicit values that end users cannot control at run-time. Moreover, reward models in RLHF stage commonly rely on single-dimensional feedback as opposed to explicit, multifaceted signals that indicate attributes such as helpfulness, humor, and toxicity. To address these limitations, we propose SteerLM, a supervised fine-tuning method that empowers end-users to control responses during inference. SteerLM conditions responses to conform to an explicitly defined multi-dimensional set of attributes, thereby empowering a steerable AI capable of generating helpful and high-quality responses while maintaining customizability. Experiments show that SteerLM trained on open source datasets generates responses that are preferred by human and automatic evaluators to many state-of-the-art baselines trained with RLHF while being much easier to train.

This paper studies the setting of online RLHF and focus on improving sample efficiency. All existing algorithms in online RLHF, whether doing passive exploration or active exploration, suffer from a sample complexity that scales exponentially with the scale of the reward function. This fundamental limitation hinders their effectiveness in scenarios with heavily skewed preferences, e.g. questions with a unique correct solution. To address this, we introduce Self-Exploring Preference-Incentive Online Preference Optimization (SE-POPO), an online RLHF algorithm that for the first time achieves a sample complexity that scales polynomially with the reward scale, answering an open problem raised by Xie et al. (2024).. Theoretically, we demonstrate that the sample complexity of SE-POPO dominates that of existing exploration algorithms. Empirically, our systematic evaluation confirms that SE-POPO is more sample-efficient than both exploratory and non-exploratory baselines, in two primary application scenarios of RLHF as well as on public benchmarks, marking a significant step forward in RLHF algorithm design. The code is available at https://github.com/MYC000801/SE-POPO.</p></details> |  |
| **[SCAR: Shapley Credit Assignment for More Efficient RLHF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.20417v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is a widely used technique for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences, yet it often suffers from sparse reward signals, making effective credit assignment challenging. In typical setups, the reward model provides a single scalar score for an entire generated sequence, offering little insight into which token or span-level decisions were responsible for the outcome. To address this, we propose Shapley Credit Assignment Rewards (SCAR), a novel method that leverages Shapley values in cooperative game theory. SCAR distributes the total sequence-level reward among constituent tokens or text spans based on their principled marginal contributions. This creates dense reward signals, crucially, without necessitating the training of auxiliary critique models or recourse to fine-grained human annotations at intermediate generation stages. Unlike prior dense reward methods, SCAR offers a game-theoretic foundation for fair credit attribution. Theoretically, we demonstrate that SCAR preserves the original optimal policy, and empirically, across diverse tasks including sentiment control, text summarization, and instruction tuning, we show that SCAR converges significantly faster and achieves higher final reward scores compared to standard RLHF and attention-based dense reward baselines. Our findings suggest that SCAR provides a more effective and theoretically sound method for credit assignment in RLHF, leading to more efficient alignment of LLMs.</p></details> |  |

We hypothesize that this stems from evaluator feedback depending on downstream outcome predictions (foresight) that can be influenced by the AI's output, inducing Goodhart's law dynamics. We present a theoretical analysis showing that conditioning evaluator feedback on downstream observations (hindsight) inhibits this effect by decoupling the alignment signal from potentially compromised predictions--crucially, the result holds even if the observed outcomes are sampled from the AI's own world model. Building on this insight, we introduce Reinforcement Learning from Hindsight Simulation (RLHS), which presents plausible simulated outcomes to evaluators before eliciting feedback. We validate RLHS across three consultancy settings--marketplace interactions, restaurant recommendations, and online course advising--using both online (PPO) and offline (DPO) fine-tuning methods, and show that it substantially improves alignment over RLHF in experiments and human evaluations. We perform post-hoc benchmark evaluations on TruthfulQA, HaluEval, and TrustLLM, finding that even after single-task fine-tuning, RLHF misalignment persists, whereas RLHS consistently outperforms baselines and demonstrates robust alignment generalization.

However, the current landscape lacks an accessible, efficient, and cost-effective end-to-end RLHF (Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback) training pipeline for these powerful models, particularly when training at the scale of billions of parameters. This paper introduces DeepSpeed-Chat, a novel system that democratizes RLHF training, making it accessible to the AI community. DeepSpeed-Chat offers three key capabilities: an easy-to-use training and inference experience for ChatGPT-like models, a DeepSpeed-RLHF pipeline that replicates the training pipeline from InstructGPT, and a robust DeepSpeed-RLHF system that combines various optimizations for training and inference in a unified way. The system delivers unparalleled efficiency and scalability, enabling training of models with hundreds of billions of parameters in record time and at a fraction of the cost. With this development, DeepSpeed-Chat paves the way for broader access to advanced RLHF training, even for data scientists with limited resources, thereby fostering innovation and further development in the field of AI.</p></details> | 14 pages, 7 figures |
| **[One Framework to Rule Them All: Unifying RL-Based and RL-Free Methods in RLHF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19523v2)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this article, we primarily examine a variety of RL-based and RL-free methods designed to address Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Large Reasoning Models (LRMs). We begin with a concise overview of the typical steps involved in RLHF and LRMs. Next, we reinterpret several RL-based and RL-free algorithms through the perspective of neural structured bandit prediction, providing a clear conceptual framework that uncovers a deeper connection between these seemingly distinct approaches. Following this, we briefly review some core principles of reinforcement learning, drawing attention to an often-overlooked aspect in existing RLHF studies. This leads to a detailed derivation of the standard RLHF objective within a full RL context, demonstrating its equivalence to neural structured bandit prediction. Finally, by reinvestigating the principles behind Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), we pinpoint areas needing adjustment, which culminates in the introduction of the Generalized Reinforce Optimization (GRO) framework, seamlessly integrating RL-based and RL-free methods in RLHF. We look forward to the community's efforts to empirically validate GRO and invite constructive feedback.</p></details> |  |

However, the quality of RLHF and DPO training is seriously compromised by \textit{\textbf{C}orrupted} preference, reward \textit{\textbf{O}veroptimization}, and bias towards \textit{\textbf{V}erbosity}. To our knowledge, most existing works tackle only one of these important issues, and the few other works require much computation to estimate multiple reward models and lack theoretical guarantee of generalization ability. In this work, we propose RLHF-\textbf{COV} and DPO-\textbf{COV} algorithms that can simultaneously mitigate these three issues, in both offline and online settings. This ability is theoretically demonstrated by obtaining length-regularized generalization error rates for our DPO-COV algorithms trained on corrupted data, which match the best-known rates for simpler cases with clean data and without length regularization. Moreover, our DPO-COV algorithm is simple to implement without reward estimation, and is proved to be equivalent to our RLHF-COV algorithm, which directly implies the equivalence between the vanilla RLHF and DPO algorithms. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our DPO-COV algorithms under both offline and online settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Opal: An Operator Algebra View of RLHF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.11298v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Opal, an operator view of reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Objectives are expressed as ladders of two primitives on a base utility: additive penalties and multiplicative pairwise weights. We describe a simple reduction law with if-and-only-if conditions: such ladders collapse to a normal form on pairwise margins when the reference is fixed, penalties are additive, and weights are independent of intermediate margins. When these assumptions do not hold (reference shift, non-additive gates, score-dependent weights), small examples demonstrate non-reducibility. Building on this view, we introduce GKPO (Generalized Kernel Preference Object), a canonical schema in which many RLHF methods can be represented and, when reducible, mapped back from. GKPO provides a standard JSON serialization, canonicalization and hashing rules, and explicit flags with finite witnesses when assumptions fail. We illustrate these ideas with GKPO examples for DPO, RRHF, and ORPO, along with cross-method conversions (where assumptions permit) and minimal stress tests (SHIFT/GATE/SCORE) that highlight non-reducibility. A lightweight Python reference library accompanies the schema, implementing canonical hashing and adapters for DPO and RRHF.</p></details> | 11 pages main |

We create an RLHF pipeline from scratch, enumerate over 20 key implementation details, and share key insights during the reproduction. Our RLHF-trained Pythia models demonstrate significant gains in response quality that scale with model size, with our 2.8B, 6.9B models outperforming OpenAI's released 1.3B checkpoint.

| **[KL-Regularised Q-Learning: A Token-level Action-Value perspective on Online RLHF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.17000v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) is an established and effective policy gradient algorithm used for Language Model Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (LM-RLHF). PPO performs well empirically but has a heuristic motivation and handles the KL-divergence constraint used in LM-RLHF in an ad-hoc manner. In this paper, we develop a a new action-value RL method for the LM-RLHF setting, KL-regularised Q-Learning (KLQ). We then show that our method is equivalent to a version of PPO in a certain specific sense, despite its very different motivation. Finally, we benchmark KLQ on two key language generation tasks -- summarisation and single-turn dialogue. We demonstrate that KLQ performs on-par with PPO at optimising the LM-RLHF objective, and achieves a consistently higher win-rate against PPO on LLM-as-a-judge evaluations.</p></details> |  |
| **[RLHF-V: Towards Trustworthy MLLMs via Behavior Alignment from Fine-grained Correctional Human Feedback](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.00849v2)** | 2024-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have recently demonstrated impressive capabilities in multimodal understanding, reasoning, and interaction. However, existing MLLMs prevalently suffer from serious hallucination problems, generating text that is not factually grounded in associated images. The problem makes existing MLLMs untrustworthy and thus impractical in real-world (especially high-stakes) applications. To address the challenge, we present RLHF-V, which enhances MLLM trustworthiness via behavior alignment from fine-grained correctional human feedback. Specifically, RLHF-V collects human preference in the form of segment-level corrections on hallucinations, and performs dense direct preference optimization over the human feedback. Comprehensive experiments on five benchmarks in both automatic and human evaluation show that, RLHF-V can enable substantially more trustworthy MLLM behaviors with promising data and computation efficiency. Remarkably, using 1.4k annotated data samples, RLHF-V significantly reduces the hallucination rate of the base MLLM by 34.8%, outperforming the concurrent LLaVA-RLHF trained on 10k annotated data. The final model achieves state-of-the-art performance in trustworthiness among open-source MLLMs, and shows better robustness than GPT-4V in preventing hallucinations aroused from over-generalization. We open-source our code, model, and data at https://github.com/RLHF-V/RLHF-V.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2024</p></details> |

However, such an approach overlooks the rich diversity of human preferences inherent in data collected from multiple users. In this work, we first derive an impossibility result of alignment with single reward RLHF, thereby highlighting its insufficiency in representing diverse human preferences. To provide an equitable solution to the problem, we learn a mixture of preference distributions via an expectation-maximization algorithm and propose a MaxMin alignment objective for policy learning inspired by the Egalitarian principle in social choice theory to better represent diverse human preferences. We elucidate the connection of our proposed approach to distributionally robust optimization and general utility RL, thereby highlighting the generality and robustness of our proposed solution. We present comprehensive experimental results on small-scale (GPT-2) and large-scale language models (with Tulu2-7B) and show the efficacy of the proposed approach in the presence of diversity among human preferences. Our algorithm achieves an average improvement of more than 16% in win-rates over conventional RLHF algorithms and improves the win-rate (accuracy) for minority groups by over 33% without compromising the performance of majority groups, showcasing the robustness and fairness of our approach. We remark that our findings in this work are not only limited to language models but also extend to reinforcement learning in general.</p></details> |  |
| **[Secrets of RLHF in Large Language Models Part I: PPO](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.04964v2)** | 2023-07-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have formulated a blueprint for the advancement of artificial general intelligence. Its primary objective is to function as a human-centric (helpful, honest, and harmless) assistant. Alignment with humans assumes paramount significance, and reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) emerges as the pivotal technological paradigm underpinning this pursuit. Current technical routes usually include \textbf{reward models} to measure human preferences, \textbf{Proximal Policy Optimization} (PPO) to optimize policy model outputs, and \textbf{process supervision} to improve step-by-step reasoning capabilities. However, due to the challenges of reward design, environment interaction, and agent training, coupled with huge trial and error cost of large language models, there is a significant barrier for AI researchers to motivate the development of technical alignment and safe landing of LLMs. The stable training of RLHF has still been a puzzle. In the first report, we dissect the framework of RLHF, re-evaluate the inner workings of PPO, and explore how the parts comprising PPO algorithms impact policy agent training. We identify policy constraints being the key factor for the effective implementation of the PPO algorithm. Therefore, we explore the PPO-max, an advanced version of PPO algorithm, to efficiently improve the training stability of the policy model. Based on our main results, we perform a comprehensive analysis of RLHF abilities compared with SFT models and ChatGPT. The absence of open-source implementations has posed significant challenges to the investigation of LLMs alignment. Therefore, we are eager to release technical reports, reward models and PPO codes, aiming to make modest contributions to the advancement of LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[More RLHF, More Trust? On The Impact of Preference Alignment On Trustworthiness](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.18870v2)** | 2024-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The trustworthiness of Large Language Models (LLMs) refers to the extent to which their outputs are reliable, safe, and ethically aligned, and it has become a crucial consideration alongside their cognitive performance. In practice, Reinforcement Learning From Human Feedback (RLHF) has been widely used to align LLMs with labeled human preferences, but its assumed effect on model trustworthiness hasn't been rigorously evaluated. To bridge this knowledge gap, this study investigates how models aligned with general-purpose preference data perform across five trustworthiness verticals: toxicity, stereotypical bias, machine ethics, truthfulness, and privacy. Our results demonstrate that RLHF on human preferences doesn't automatically guarantee trustworthiness, and reverse effects are often observed. Furthermore, we propose to adapt efficient influence function based data attribution methods to the RLHF setting to better understand the influence of fine-tuning data on individual trustworthiness benchmarks, and show its feasibility by providing our estimated attribution scores. Together, our results underscore the need for more nuanced approaches for model alignment from both the data and framework perspectives, and we hope this research will guide the community towards developing language models that are increasingly capable without sacrificing trustworthiness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploratory Preference Optimization: Harnessing Implicit Q*-Approximation for Sample-Efficient RLHF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.21046v1)** | 2024-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a central tool for language model alignment. We consider online exploration in RLHF, which exploits interactive access to human or AI feedback by deliberately encouraging the model to produce diverse, maximally informative responses. By allowing RLHF to confidently stray from the pre-trained model, online exploration offers the possibility of novel, potentially super-human capabilities, but its full potential as a paradigm for language model training has yet to be realized, owing to computational and statistical bottlenecks in directly adapting existing reinforcement learning techniques. We propose a new algorithm for online exploration in RLHF, Exploratory Preference Optimization (XPO), which is simple and practical -- a one-line change to (online) Direct Preference Optimization (DPO; Rafailov et al., 2023) -- yet enjoys the strongest known provable guarantees and promising empirical performance. XPO augments the DPO objective with a novel and principled exploration bonus, empowering the algorithm to explore outside the support of the initial model and human feedback data. In theory, we show that XPO is provably sample-efficient and converges to a near-optimal language model policy under natural exploration conditions, irrespective of whether the initial model has good coverage. Our analysis, which builds on the observation that DPO implicitly performs a form of $Q^{\star}$-approximation (or, Bellman error minimization), combines previously disparate techniques from language modeling and theoretical reinforcement learning in a serendipitous fashion through the perspective of KL-regularized Markov decision processes. Empirically, we find that XPO is more sample-efficient than non-exploratory DPO variants in a preliminary evaluation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Balanced Actor Initialization: Stable RLHF Training of Distillation-Based Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.00309v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of alignment and reasoning capabilities in large language models has seen remarkable progress through two paradigms: instruction tuning and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) alignment paradigm, and distillation-based reasoning fine-tuning paradigm. While both approaches prove effective independently, the third paradigm of applying RLHF to distillation-trained models presents significant challenges. Our investigation reveals two critical phenomena that emerge in this paradigm: Sequence Length Collapse, where language generation dramatically reduces during early RLHF training, and the Reward Hockey Stick Curve, featuring severe reward score drops followed by gradual recovery. These instabilities fundamentally compromise the model's alignment and reasoning capabilities. To address these challenges, we propose Balanced Actor Initialization (BAI), a two-stage weighted model merging approach. BAI first merges instruction-following and distillation-based reasoning fine-tuned models, then further combines this intermediate model with the pretrained model to preserve foundational knowledge. Through comprehensive experiments across diverse benchmarks and detailed analysis of training experiments, we demonstrate that BAI resolves Sequence Length Collapse, mitigates the Reward Hockey Stick Curve, and enables continuous sequence length improvement during training. Additionally, our analysis reveals that balanced merging ratios achieve optimal trade-offs between training stability and reasoning capability preservation. Our work provides the effective solution for stable training in this third paradigm, enabling more capable reasoning models that combine distillation efficiency with RLHF alignment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimal Design for Reward Modeling in RLHF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.17055v2)** | 2024-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has become a popular approach to align language models (LMs) with human preferences. This method involves collecting a large dataset of human pairwise preferences across various text generations and using it to infer (implicitly or explicitly) a reward model. Numerous methods have been proposed to learn the reward model and align a LM with it. However, the costly process of collecting human preferences has received little attention and could benefit from theoretical insights. This paper addresses this issue and aims to formalize the reward training model in RLHF. We frame the selection of an effective dataset as a simple regret minimization task, using a linear contextual dueling bandit method. Given the potentially large number of arms, this approach is more coherent than the best-arm identification setting. We then propose an offline framework for solving this problem. Under appropriate assumptions - linearity of the reward model in the embedding space, and boundedness of the reward parameter - we derive bounds on the simple regret. Finally, we provide a lower bound that matches our upper bound up to constant and logarithmic terms. To our knowledge, this is the first theoretical contribution in this area to provide an offline approach as well as worst-case guarantees.</p></details> |  |

We first identify the primary challenges of existing popular methods like offline PPO and offline DPO as lacking in strategical exploration of the environment. Then, to understand the mathematical principle of RLHF, we consider a standard mathematical formulation, the reverse-KL regularized contextual bandit for RLHF. Despite its widespread practical application, a rigorous theoretical analysis of this formulation remains open. We investigate its behavior in three distinct settings -- offline, online, and hybrid -- and propose efficient algorithms with finite-sample theoretical guarantees. Moving towards practical applications, our framework, with a robust approximation of the information-theoretical policy improvement oracle, naturally gives rise to several novel RLHF algorithms. This includes an iterative version of the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) algorithm for online settings, and a multi-step rejection sampling strategy for offline scenarios. Our empirical evaluations on real-world alignment experiment of large language model demonstrate that these proposed methods significantly surpass existing strong baselines, such as DPO and Rejection Sampling Optimization (RSO), showcasing the connections between solid theoretical foundations and their potent practical implementations.</p></details> | <details><summary>53 pa...</summary><p>53 pages; theoretical study and algorithmic design of iterative RLHF and DPO</p></details> |

However, we argue that the predominant approach for aligning LLMs with human preferences through a reward model -- reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) -- suffers from an inherent algorithmic bias due to its Kullback--Leibler-based regularization in optimization. In extreme cases, this bias could lead to a phenomenon we term preference collapse, where minority preferences are virtually disregarded. To mitigate this algorithmic bias, we introduce preference matching (PM) RLHF, a novel approach that provably aligns LLMs with the preference distribution of the reward model under the Bradley--Terry--Luce/Plackett--Luce model. Central to our approach is a PM regularizer that takes the form of the negative logarithm of the LLM's policy probability distribution over responses, which helps the LLM balance response diversification and reward maximization. Notably, we obtain this regularizer by solving an ordinary differential equation that is necessary for the PM property. For practical implementation, we introduce a conditional variant of PM RLHF that is tailored to natural language generation. Finally, we empirically validate the effectiveness of conditional PM RLHF through experiments on the OPT and Llama-family models, demonstrating a 29% to 41% improvement in alignment with human preferences, as measured by a certain metric, compared to standard RLHF.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the Journal of the American Statistical Association</p></details> |

An RL Perspective on RLHF, Prompting, and Beyond](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.06147v1)** | 2023-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have garnered wide attention and led to successful products such as ChatGPT and GPT-4. Their proficiency in adhering to instructions and delivering harmless, helpful, and honest (3H) responses can largely be attributed to the technique of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). In this paper, we aim to link the research in conventional RL to RL techniques used in LLM research. Demystify this technique by discussing why, when, and how RL excels. Furthermore, we explore potential future avenues that could either benefit from or contribute to RLHF research. Highlighted Takeaways: 1. RLHF is Online Inverse RL with Offline Demonstration Data. 2. RLHF $>$ SFT because Imitation Learning (and Inverse RL) $>$ Behavior Cloning (BC) by alleviating the problem of compounding error. 3. The RM step in RLHF generates a proxy of the expensive human feedback, such an insight can be generalized to other LLM tasks such as prompting evaluation and optimization where feedback is also expensive. 4. The policy learning in RLHF is more challenging than conventional problems studied in IRL due to their high action dimensionality and feedback sparsity. 5. The main superiority of PPO over off-policy value-based methods is its stability gained from (almost) on-policy data and conservative policy updates.</p></details> |  |

Notably, collecting human feedback for RLHF can be resource-intensive and lead to scalability issues for LLMs and complex tasks. Our proposed framework Proto-RM leverages prototypical networks to enhance reward models under limited human feedback. By enabling stable and reliable structural learning from fewer samples, Proto-RM significantly enhances LLMs' adaptability and accuracy in interpreting human preferences. Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate that Proto-RM significantly improves the performance of reward models and LLMs in human feedback tasks, achieving comparable and usually better results than traditional methods, while requiring significantly less data. in data-limited scenarios.

RL from AI Feedback (RLAIF), introduced in Bai et al., offers a promising alternative that trains the reward model (RM) on preferences generated by an off-the-shelf LLM. Across the tasks of summarization, helpful dialogue generation, and harmless dialogue generation, we show that RLAIF achieves comparable performance to RLHF. Furthermore, we take a step towards "self-improvement" by demonstrating that RLAIF can outperform a supervised fine-tuned baseline even when the AI labeler is the same size as the policy, or even the exact same checkpoint as the initial policy. Finally, we introduce direct-RLAIF (d-RLAIF) - a technique that circumvents RM training by obtaining rewards directly from an off-the-shelf LLM during RL, which achieves superior performance to canonical RLAIF. Our results suggest that RLAIF can achieve performance on-par with using human feedback, offering a potential solution to the scalability limitations of RLHF.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at ICML 2024</p></details> |

However, existing methods often rely on static, rare-token-based triggers, limiting their effectiveness in realistic scenarios. In this paper, we develop GREAT, a novel framework for crafting generalizable backdoors in RLHF through emotion-aware trigger synthesis. Specifically, GREAT targets harmful response generation for a vulnerable user subgroup characterized by both semantically violent requests and emotionally angry triggers. At the core of GREAT is a trigger identification pipeline that operates in the latent embedding space, leveraging principal component analysis and clustering techniques to identify the most representative triggers. To enable this, we present Erinyes, a high-quality dataset of over $5000$ angry triggers curated from GPT-4.1 using a principled, hierarchical, and diversity-promoting approach. Experiments on benchmark RLHF datasets demonstrate that GREAT significantly outperforms baseline methods in attack success rates, especially for unseen trigger scenarios, while largely preserving the response quality on benign inputs.</p></details> |  |

The initial phase of RLHF involves learning human values using a reward model from ranking data. It is observed that the performance of the reward model degrades after one epoch of training, and optimizing too much against the learned reward model eventually hinders the true objective. This paper delves into these issues, leveraging the theoretical insights to design improved reward learning algorithm termed 'Iterative Data Smoothing' (IDS). The core idea is that during each training epoch, we not only update the model with the data, but also update the date using the model, replacing hard labels with soft labels. Our empirical findings highlight the superior performance of this approach over the traditional methods.</p></details> |  |

However, its training pipeline suffers from substantial inefficiencies due to sequential multi-model dependencies (e.g., reward model depends on actor outputs) and long-tail response lengths, where a few long responses straggle the stage completion. We present OPPO, a novel, lightweight, and model-agnostic PPO-based RLHF framework that improves training efficiency by overlapping pipeline execution. OPPO introduces two novel techniques: (1) Intra-step overlap, which streams upstream model outputs (e.g., actor model) in right-sized chunks, enabling the downstream model (e.g., reward) to begin prefill while the upstream continues decoding; and (2) Inter-step overlap, which adaptively overcommits a few prompts and defers long generations to future steps, mitigating tail latency without discarding partial work. OPPO integrates easily with existing PPO implementations with a few lines of code change. Extensive evaluations show that OPPO accelerates PPO-based RLHF training by $1.8 \times-2.8 \times$ and improves GPU utilization by $1.4 \times-2.1 \times$ without compromising training convergence.</p></details> | <details><summary>Kaizh...</summary><p>Kaizhuo Yan and Yingjie Yu contributed equally to this work</p></details> |

Hidden context refers to data that affects the feedback received, but which is not represented in the data used to train a preference model. This captures common issues of data collection, such as having human annotators with varied preferences, cognitive processes that result in seemingly irrational behavior, and combining data labeled according to different criteria. We prove that standard applications of preference learning, including reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), implicitly aggregate over hidden contexts according to a well-known voting rule called Borda count. We show this can produce counter-intuitive results that are very different from other methods which implicitly aggregate via expected utility. Furthermore, our analysis formalizes the way that preference learning from users with diverse values tacitly implements a social choice function. A key implication of this result is that annotators have an incentive to misreport their preferences in order to influence the learned model, leading to vulnerabilities in the deployment of RLHF. As a step towards mitigating these problems, we introduce a class of methods called distributional preference learning (DPL). DPL methods estimate a distribution of possible score values for each alternative in order to better account for hidden context. Experimental results indicate that applying DPL to RLHF for LLM chatbots identifies hidden context in the data and significantly reduces subsequent jailbreak vulnerability.

However, little research has been conducted on error detection of LLM responses. Collecting error annotations on LLM responses is challenging due to the subjective nature of many NLP tasks, and thus previous research focuses on tasks of little practical value (e.g., word sorting) or limited error types (e.g., faithfulness in summarization). This work introduces ReaLMistake, the first error detection benchmark consisting of objective, realistic, and diverse errors made by LLMs. ReaLMistake contains three challenging and meaningful tasks that introduce objectively assessable errors in four categories (reasoning correctness, instruction-following, context-faithfulness, and parameterized knowledge), eliciting naturally observed and diverse errors in responses of GPT-4 and Llama 2 70B annotated by experts. We use ReaLMistake to evaluate error detectors based on 12 LLMs. Our findings show: 1) Top LLMs like GPT-4 and Claude 3 detect errors made by LLMs at very low recall, and all LLM-based error detectors perform much worse than humans. 2) Explanations by LLM-based error detectors lack reliability. 3) LLMs-based error detection is sensitive to small changes in prompts but remains challenging to improve. 4) Popular approaches to improving LLMs, including self-consistency and majority vote, do not improve the error detection performance.

| **[LLM Chemistry Estimation for Multi-LLM Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.03930v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-LLM collaboration promises accurate, robust, and context-aware solutions, yet existing approaches rely on implicit selection and output assessment without analyzing whether collaborating models truly complement or conflict. We introduce LLM Chemistry -- a framework that measures when LLM combinations exhibit synergistic or antagonistic behaviors that shape collective performance beyond individual capabilities. We formalize the notion of chemistry among LLMs, propose algorithms that quantify it by analyzing interaction dependencies, and recommend optimal model ensembles accordingly. Our theoretical analysis shows that chemistry among collaborating LLMs is most evident under heterogeneous model profiles, with its outcome impact shaped by task type, group size, and complexity. Evaluation on classification, summarization, and program repair tasks provides initial evidence for these task-dependent effects, thereby reinforcing our theoretical results. This establishes LLM Chemistry as both a diagnostic factor in multi-LLM systems and a foundation for ensemble recommendation.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 5 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[On the Roles of LLMs in Planning: Embedding LLMs into Planning Graphs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.00783v2)** | 2024-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Plan synthesis aims to generate a course of actions or policies to transit given initial states to goal states, provided domain models that could be designed by experts or learnt from training data or interactions with the world. Intrigued by the claims of emergent planning capabilities in large language models (LLMs), works have been proposed to investigate the planning effectiveness of LLMs, without considering any utilization of off-the-shelf planning techniques in LLMs. In this paper, we aim to further study the insight of the planning capability of LLMs by investigating the roles of LLMs in off-the-shelf planning frameworks. To do this, we investigate the effectiveness of embedding LLMs into one of the well-known planning frameworks, graph-based planning, proposing a novel LLMs-based planning framework with LLMs embedded in two levels of planning graphs, i.e., mutual constraints generation level and constraints solving level. We empirically exhibit the effectiveness of our proposed framework in various planning domains.</p></details> |  |

However, users with data privacy concerns face limitations in directly utilizing LLM APIs, while private deployments incur significant computational demands. This creates a substantial challenge in achieving secure LLM adaptation under constrained local resources. To address this issue, collaborative learning methods, such as Split Learning (SL), offer a resource-efficient and privacy-preserving solution for adapting LLMs to private domains. In this study, we introduce VFLAIR-LLM (available at https://github.com/FLAIR-THU/VFLAIR-LLM), an extensible and lightweight split learning framework for LLMs, enabling privacy-preserving LLM inference and fine-tuning in resource-constrained environments. Our library provides two LLM partition settings, supporting three task types and 18 datasets. In addition, we provide standard modules for implementing and evaluating attacks and defenses. We benchmark 5 attacks and 9 defenses under various Split Learning for LLM(SL-LLM) settings, offering concrete insights and recommendations on the choice of model partition configurations, defense strategies, and relevant hyperparameters for real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 10 figures, published in KDD2025</p></details> |
| **[When One LLM Drools, Multi-LLM Collaboration Rules](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.04506v1)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This position paper argues that in many realistic (i.e., complex, contextualized, subjective) scenarios, one LLM is not enough to produce a reliable output. We challenge the status quo of relying solely on a single general-purpose LLM and argue for multi-LLM collaboration to better represent the extensive diversity of data, skills, and people. We first posit that a single LLM underrepresents real-world data distributions, heterogeneous skills, and pluralistic populations, and that such representation gaps cannot be trivially patched by further training a single LLM. We then organize existing multi-LLM collaboration methods into a hierarchy, based on the level of access and information exchange, ranging from API-level, text-level, logit-level, to weight-level collaboration. Based on these methods, we highlight how multi-LLM collaboration addresses challenges that a single LLM struggles with, such as reliability, democratization, and pluralism. Finally, we identify the limitations of existing multi-LLM methods and motivate future work. We envision multi-LLM collaboration as an essential path toward compositional intelligence and collaborative AI development.</p></details> |  |

One of the most promising applications is their role as evaluators based on natural language responses, referred to as ''LLMs-as-judges''. This framework has attracted growing attention from both academia and industry due to their excellent effectiveness, ability to generalize across tasks, and interpretability in the form of natural language. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the LLMs-as-judges paradigm from five key perspectives: Functionality, Methodology, Applications, Meta-evaluation, and Limitations. We begin by providing a systematic definition of LLMs-as-Judges and introduce their functionality (Why use LLM judges?). Then we address methodology to construct an evaluation system with LLMs (How to use LLM judges?). Additionally, we investigate the potential domains for their application (Where to use LLM judges?) and discuss methods for evaluating them in various contexts (How to evaluate LLM judges?). Finally, we provide a detailed analysis of the limitations of LLM judges and discuss potential future directions. Through a structured and comprehensive analysis, we aim aims to provide insights on the development and application of LLMs-as-judges in both research and practice.

The performance of an LLM inference service is largely determined by the hardware onto which it is deployed, but understanding of which hardware will deliver on performance requirements remains challenging. In this work we present LLM-Pilot - a first-of-its-kind system for characterizing and predicting performance of LLM inference services. LLM-Pilot performs benchmarking of LLM inference services, under a realistic workload, across a variety of GPUs, and optimizes the service configuration for each considered GPU to maximize performance. Finally, using this characterization data, LLM-Pilot learns a predictive model, which can be used to recommend the most cost-effective hardware for a previously unseen LLM. Compared to existing methods, LLM-Pilot can deliver on performance requirements 33% more frequently, whilst reducing costs by 60% on average.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis (SC '24)</p></details> |
| **[LLM-Sketch: Enhancing Network Sketches with LLM](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.07495v1)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Network stream mining is fundamental to many network operations. Sketches, as compact data structures that offer low memory overhead with bounded accuracy, have emerged as a promising solution for network stream mining. Recent studies attempt to optimize sketches using machine learning; however, these approaches face the challenges of lacking adaptivity to dynamic networks and incurring high training costs. In this paper, we propose LLM-Sketch, based on the insight that fields beyond the flow IDs in packet headers can also help infer flow sizes. By using a two-tier data structure and separately recording large and small flows, LLM-Sketch improves accuracy while minimizing memory usage. Furthermore, it leverages fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) to reliably estimate flow sizes. We evaluate LLM-Sketch on three representative tasks, and the results demonstrate that LLM-Sketch outperforms state-of-the-art methods by achieving a $7.5\times$ accuracy improvement.</p></details> |  |

Indeed, recent research has shown that LLMs are capable of solving the majority of the assignments and exams we previously used in CS1. In addition, professional software engineers are often using these tools, raising the question of whether we should be training our students in their use as well. This experience report describes a CS1 course at a large research-intensive university that fully embraces the use of LLMs from the beginning of the course. To incorporate the LLMs, the course was intentionally altered to reduce emphasis on syntax and writing code from scratch. Instead, the course now emphasizes skills needed to successfully produce software with an LLM. This includes explaining code, testing code, and decomposing large problems into small functions that are solvable by an LLM. In addition to frequent, formative assessments of these skills, students were given three large, open-ended projects in three separate domains (data science, image processing, and game design) that allowed them to showcase their creativity in topics of their choosing. In an end-of-term survey, students reported that they appreciated learning with the assistance of the LLM and that they interacted with the LLM in a variety of ways when writing code. We provide lessons learned for instructors who may wish to incorporate LLMs into their course.</p></details> | <details><summary>to be...</summary><p>to be published in Proceedings of the 29th ACM conference on innovation and technology in computer science education (ITiCSE)</p></details> |

With large language models (LLMs) crossing critical reliability thresholds for a growing slate of capabilities, there is an increasing effort to decompose systems into sets of LLM-based agents, each of whom can be delegated sub-tasks. However, this decomposition (even when automated) is often intuitive, e.g., based on how a human might assign roles to members of a human team. How close are these role decompositions to optimal? This position paper argues that asymptotic analysis with LLM primitives is needed to reason about the efficiency of such decomposed systems, and that insights from such analysis will unlock opportunities for scaling them. By treating the LLM forward pass as the atomic unit of computational cost, one can separate out the (often opaque) inner workings of a particular LLM from the inherent efficiency of how a set of LLMs are orchestrated to solve hard problems. In other words, if we want to scale the deployment of LLMs to the limit, instead of anthropomorphizing LLMs, asymptotic analysis with LLM primitives should be used to reason about and develop more powerful decompositions of large problems into LLM agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings of the 42nd International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2025); 13 pages including references</p></details> |
| **[Set-LLM: A Permutation-Invariant LLM](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15433v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities across numerous applications, their robustness remains a critical concern. This paper is motivated by a specific vulnerability: the order sensitivity of LLMs. This vulnerability manifests itself as the order bias observed when LLMs decide between possible options (for example, a preference for the first option) and the tendency of LLMs to provide different answers when options are reordered. The use cases for this scenario extend beyond the classical case of multiple-choice question answering to the use of LLMs as automated evaluators in AI pipelines, comparing output generated by different models. We introduce Set-LLM, a novel architectural adaptation for pretrained LLMs that enables the processing of mixed set-text inputs with permutation invariance guarantees. The adaptations involve a new attention mask and new positional encodings specifically designed for sets. We provide a theoretical proof of invariance and demonstrate through experiments that Set-LLM can be trained effectively, achieving comparable or improved performance and maintaining the runtime of the original model, while eliminating order sensitivity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can You Trust LLM Judgments? Reliability of LLM-as-a-Judge](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.12509v2)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly powerful and ubiquitous, but their stochastic nature poses challenges to the reliability of their outputs. While deterministic settings can improve consistency, they do not guarantee reliability, as a single sample from the model's probability distribution can still be misleading. Building upon the concept of LLM-as-a-judge, we introduce a novel framework for rigorously evaluating the reliability of LLM judgments, leveraging McDonald's omega. We evaluate the reliability of LLMs when judging the outputs of other LLMs on standard single-turn and multi-turn benchmarks, simultaneously investigating the impact of temperature on reliability. By analyzing these results, we demonstrate the limitations of fixed randomness and the importance of considering multiple samples, which we show has significant implications for downstream applications. Our findings highlight the need for a nuanced understanding of LLM reliability and the potential risks associated with over-reliance on single-shot evaluations. This work provides a crucial step towards building more trustworthy and reliable LLM-based systems and applications.</p></details> |  |

To replicate human-to-human conversations, existing work uses human annotators to play the roles of the questioner (student) and the answerer (teacher). Despite its effectiveness, challenges exist as human annotation is time-consuming, inconsistent, and not scalable. To address this issue and investigate the applicability of large language models (LLMs) in CQA simulation, we propose a simulation framework that employs zero-shot learner LLMs for simulating teacher-student interactions. Our framework involves two LLMs interacting on a specific topic, with the first LLM acting as a student, generating questions to explore a given search topic. The second LLM plays the role of a teacher by answering questions and is equipped with additional information, including a text on the given topic. We implement both the student and teacher by zero-shot prompting the GPT-4 model. To assess the effectiveness of LLMs in simulating CQA interactions and understand the disparities between LLM- and human-generated conversations, we evaluate the simulated data from various perspectives. We begin by evaluating the teacher's performance through both automatic and human assessment. Next, we evaluate the performance of the student, analyzing and comparing the disparities between questions generated by the LLM and those generated by humans. Furthermore, we conduct extensive analyses to thoroughly examine the LLM performance by benchmarking state-of-the-art reading comprehension models on both datasets. Our results reveal that the teacher LLM generates lengthier answers that tend to be more accurate and complete. The student LLM generates more diverse questions, covering more aspects of a given topic.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at WSDM 2024</p></details> |

Guidelines provided by ISO and NIST aim to govern AI risk management; however, practical implementations remain scarce in scholarly works. Addressing this void, our research explores risks emanating from downstream uses of large language models (LLMs), synthesizing a taxonomy grounded in earlier research. Building upon this foundation, we introduce a novel LLM-based risk assessment engine (GUARD-D-LLM: Guided Understanding and Assessment for Risk Detection for Downstream use of LLMs) designed to pinpoint and rank threats relevant to specific use cases derived from text-based user inputs. Integrating thirty intelligent agents, this innovative approach identifies bespoke risks, gauges their severity, offers targeted suggestions for mitigation, and facilitates risk-aware development. The paper also documents the limitations of such an approach along with way forward suggestions to augment experts in such risk assessment thereby leveraging GUARD-D-LLM in identifying risks early on and enabling early mitigations. This paper and its associated code serve as a valuable resource for developers seeking to mitigate risks associated with LLM-based applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Vision LLMs Are Bad at Hierarchical Visual Understanding, and LLMs Are the Bottleneck](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.24840v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper reveals that many state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) lack hierarchical knowledge about our visual world, unaware of even well-established biology taxonomies. This shortcoming makes LLMs a bottleneck for vision LLMs' hierarchical visual understanding (e.g., recognizing Anemone Fish but not Vertebrate). We arrive at these findings using about one million four-choice visual question answering (VQA) tasks constructed from six taxonomies and four image datasets. Interestingly, finetuning a vision LLM using our VQA tasks reaffirms LLMs' bottleneck effect to some extent because the VQA tasks improve the LLM's hierarchical consistency more than the vision LLM's. We conjecture that one cannot make vision LLMs understand visual concepts fully hierarchical until LLMs possess corresponding taxonomy knowledge.</p></details> | 28 pages, 13 figures |
| **[LLMs + Persona-Plug = Personalized LLMs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.11901v1)** | 2024-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Personalization plays a critical role in numerous language tasks and applications, since users with the same requirements may prefer diverse outputs based on their individual interests. This has led to the development of various personalized approaches aimed at adapting large language models (LLMs) to generate customized outputs aligned with user preferences. Some of them involve fine-tuning a unique personalized LLM for each user, which is too expensive for widespread application. Alternative approaches introduce personalization information in a plug-and-play manner by retrieving the user's relevant historical texts as demonstrations. However, this retrieval-based strategy may break the continuity of the user history and fail to capture the user's overall styles and patterns, hence leading to sub-optimal performance. To address these challenges, we propose a novel personalized LLM model, \ours{}. It constructs a user-specific embedding for each individual by modeling all her historical contexts through a lightweight plug-in user embedder module. By attaching this embedding to the task input, LLMs can better understand and capture user habits and preferences, thereby producing more personalized outputs without tuning their own parameters. Extensive experiments on various tasks in the language model personalization (LaMP) benchmark demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms existing personalized LLM approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can LLMs Rank the Harmfulness of Smaller LLMs? We are Not There Yet](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.05291v2)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have become ubiquitous, thus it is important to understand their risks and limitations. Smaller LLMs can be deployed where compute resources are constrained, such as edge devices, but with different propensity to generate harmful output. Mitigation of LLM harm typically depends on annotating the harmfulness of LLM output, which is expensive to collect from humans. This work studies two questions: How do smaller LLMs rank regarding generation of harmful content? How well can larger LLMs annotate harmfulness? We prompt three small LLMs to elicit harmful content of various types, such as discriminatory language, offensive content, privacy invasion, or negative influence, and collect human rankings of their outputs. Then, we evaluate three state-of-the-art large LLMs on their ability to annotate the harmfulness of these responses. We find that the smaller models differ with respect to harmfulness. We also find that large LLMs show low to moderate agreement with humans. These findings underline the need for further work on harm mitigation in LLMs.</p></details> |  |

However, participating in knowledge communities involves more than just contributing content - it is also a deeply social process. While communities must carefully consider appropriate and responsible LLM integration, the absence of concrete norms has left individual editors to experiment and navigate LLM use on their own. Understanding how LLMs influence community participation is therefore critical in shaping future norms and supporting effective adoption. To address this gap, we investigated Wikipedia, one of the largest knowledge production communities, to understand 1) how LLMs influence the ways editors contribute content, 2) what strategies editors leverage to align LLM outputs with community norms, and 3) how other editors in the community respond to LLM-assisted contributions. Through interviews with 16 Wikipedia editors who had used LLMs for their edits, we found that 1) LLMs affected the content contributions for experienced and new editors differently; 2) aligning LLM outputs with community norms required tacit knowledge that often challenged newcomers; and 3) as a result, other editors responded to LLM-assisted edits differently depending on the editors' expertise level. Based on these findings, we challenge existing models of newcomer involvement and propose design implications for LLMs that support community engagement through scaffolding, teaching, and context awareness.</p></details> |  |

The presented framework applies the safety filter, designed based on the CBF, to the output generation of the baseline LLM, i.e., the sequence of the token, with the aim of intervening in the generated text. The overall text-generation system is implemented with Llama 3 and a RoBERTa model, and the source code is available at https://github.com/Mya-Mya/CBF-LLM.

Adversarial prompts can bypass their safety measures. We propose LLM Self Defense, a simple approach to defend against these attacks by having an LLM screen the induced responses. Our method does not require any fine-tuning, input preprocessing, or iterative output generation. Instead, we incorporate the generated content into a pre-defined prompt and employ another instance of an LLM to analyze the text and predict whether it is harmful. We test LLM Self Defense on GPT 3.5 and Llama 2, two of the current most prominent LLMs against various types of attacks, such as forcefully inducing affirmative responses to prompts and prompt engineering attacks. Notably, LLM Self Defense succeeds in reducing the attack success rate to virtually 0 using both GPT 3.5 and Llama 2.

A common approach to sort the ranking list is by prompting LLMs for a pairwise or setwise comparison which often relies on sorting algorithms. However, sorting-based methods require consistent comparisons to correctly sort the passages, which we show that LLMs often violate. We identify two kinds of intrinsic inconsistency in LLM-based pairwise comparisons: order inconsistency which leads to conflicting results when switching the passage order, and transitive inconsistency which leads to non-transitive triads among all preference pairs. Our study of these inconsistencies is relevant for understanding and improving the stability of any ranking scheme based on relative preferences. In this paper, we propose LLM-RankFusion, an LLM-based ranking framework that mitigates these inconsistencies and produces a robust ranking list. LLM-RankFusion mitigates order inconsistency using in-context learning (ICL) to demonstrate order-agnostic comparisons and calibration to estimate the underlying preference probability between two passages. We then address transitive inconsistency by aggregating the ranking results from multiple rankers. In our experiments, we empirically show that LLM-RankFusion can significantly reduce inconsistent comparison results, improving the ranking quality by making the final ranking list more robust. Our code is available at \href{https://github.com/XHMY/LLM-RankFusion}{https://github.com/XHMY/LLM-RankFusion}</p></details> |  |

With the success of large language models (LLMs), they have been employed in various tasks, including serving as judges (LLM-as-a-judge). In this paper, we reassess the performance of QA models using LLM-as-a-judge across four reading comprehension QA datasets. We examine different families of LLMs and various answer types to evaluate the effectiveness of LLM-as-a-judge in these tasks. Our results show that LLM-as-a-judge is highly correlated with human judgments and can replace traditional EM/F1 metrics. By using LLM-as-a-judge, the correlation with human judgments improves significantly, from 0.22 (EM) and 0.40 (F1-score) to 0.85. These findings confirm that EM and F1 metrics underestimate the true performance of the QA models. While LLM-as-a-judge is not perfect for more difficult answer types (e.g., job), it still outperforms EM/F1, and we observe no bias issues, such as self-preference, when the same model is used for both the QA and judgment tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages; code and data are available at https://github.com/Alab-NII/llm-judge-extract-qa</p></details> |

Unlike previous LLM-jailbreak methods that directly orient to LLMs, our approach begins by constructing a multimodal large language model (MLLM) built upon the target LLM. Subsequently, we perform an efficient MLLM jailbreak and obtain a jailbreaking embedding. Finally, we convert the embedding into a textual jailbreaking suffix to carry out the jailbreak of target LLM. Compared to the direct LLM-jailbreak methods, our indirect jailbreaking approach is more efficient, as MLLMs are more vulnerable to jailbreak than pure LLM. Additionally, to improve the attack success rate of jailbreak, we propose an image-text semantic matching scheme to identify a suitable initial input. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach surpasses current state-of-the-art jailbreak methods in terms of both efficiency and effectiveness. Moreover, our approach exhibits superior cross-class generalization abilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Densing Law of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.04315v2)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a milestone in artificial intelligence, and their performance can improve as the model size increases. However, this scaling brings great challenges to training and inference efficiency, particularly for deploying LLMs in resource-constrained environments, and the scaling trend is becoming increasingly unsustainable. This paper introduces the concept of ``\textit{capacity density}'' as a new metric to evaluate the quality of the LLMs across different scales and describes the trend of LLMs in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency. To calculate the capacity density of a given target LLM, we first introduce a set of reference models and develop a scaling law to predict the downstream performance of these reference models based on their parameter sizes. We then define the \textit{effective parameter size} of the target LLM as the parameter size required by a reference model to achieve equivalent performance, and formalize the capacity density as the ratio of the effective parameter size to the actual parameter size of the target LLM. Capacity density provides a unified framework for assessing both model effectiveness and efficiency. Our further analysis of recent open-source base LLMs reveals an empirical law (the densing law)that the capacity density of LLMs grows exponentially over time. More specifically, using some widely used benchmarks for evaluation, the capacity density of LLMs doubles approximately every three months. The law provides new perspectives to guide future LLM development, emphasizing the importance of improving capacity density to achieve optimal results with minimal computational overhead.</p></details> |  |

LLMs have achieved remarkable success in areas including code generation and vulnerability detection. However, they also exhibit numerous limitations and shortcomings. LLM-based agents, a novel tech nology with the potential for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), combine LLMs as the core for decision-making and action-taking, addressing some of the inherent limitations of LLMs such as lack of autonomy and self-improvement. Despite numerous studies and surveys exploring the possibility of using LLMs in software engineering, it lacks a clear distinction between LLMs and LLM based agents. It is still in its early stage for a unified standard and benchmarking to qualify an LLM solution as an LLM-based agent in its domain. In this survey, we broadly investigate the current practice and solutions for LLMs and LLM-based agents for software engineering. In particular we summarise six key topics: requirement engineering, code generation, autonomous decision-making, software design, test generation, and software maintenance. We review and differentiate the work of LLMs and LLM-based agents from these six topics, examining their differences and similarities in tasks, benchmarks, and evaluation metrics. Finally, we discuss the models and benchmarks used, providing a comprehensive analysis of their applications and effectiveness in software engineering. We anticipate this work will shed some lights on pushing the boundaries of LLM-based agents in software engineering for future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[FusionFactory: Fusing LLM Capabilities with Multi-LLM Log Data](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.10540v2)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has created a diverse landscape of models, each excelling at different tasks. This diversity drives researchers to employ multiple LLMs in practice, leaving behind valuable multi-LLM log data. This naturally leads to the question of whether such logs can be fully leveraged to fuse LLMs' complementary capabilities. Although prior work has explored various strategies for integrating multiple LLMs, we argue that practical fusion must meet two essential requirements: (1) compatibility with real-world serving scenarios (e.g., local and API-based serving), and (2) flexibility to operate at different stages of the LLM pipeline to meet varied user needs (e.g., fine-tuning and inference stages). To this end, we introduce LLMFusionBench, a large-scale benchmark for LLM fusion that spans 14 tasks across five domains, with responses from 20 open-source LLMs (8B--671B) totaling 103M tokens. Building on LLMFusionBench, we propose FusionFactory, a systematic framework with three elaborated levels: (1) query-level fusion via tailored LLM routers, (2) thought-level fusion leveraging retrieved abstract reasoning templates, and (3) model-level fusion via distillation from top-ranked responses. Experiments show that FusionFactory consistently outperforms the best individual LLM across all 14 benchmarks, with the optimal fusion configuration varying across benchmarks, highlighting the promise of multi-LLM log data as a practical foundation for fusing diverse LLM capabilities.</p></details> |  |

Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse domains, leading to the emergence of "LLM-as-a-Judge," where LLMs are employed as evaluators for complex tasks. With their ability to process diverse data types and provide scalable, cost-effective, and consistent assessments, LLMs present a compelling alternative to traditional expert-driven evaluations. However, ensuring the reliability of LLM-as-a-Judge systems remains a significant challenge that requires careful design and standardization. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of LLM-as-a-Judge, addressing the core question: How can reliable LLM-as-a-Judge systems be built? We explore strategies to enhance reliability, including improving consistency, mitigating biases, and adapting to diverse assessment scenarios. Additionally, we propose methodologies for evaluating the reliability of LLM-as-a-Judge systems, supported by a novel benchmark designed for this purpose. To advance the development and real-world deployment of LLM-as-a-Judge systems, we also discussed practical applications, challenges, and future directions. This survey serves as a foundational reference for researchers and practitioners in this rapidly evolving field.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://awesome-llm-as-a-judge.github.io/</p></details> |

This approach leverages multi-turn interactions where the LLM interviewer actively provides feedback on responses and poses follow-up questions to the evaluated LLM. At the start of the interview, the LLM interviewer dynamically modifies datasets to generate initial questions, mitigating data contamination. We apply the LLM-as-an-Interviewer framework to evaluate six models on the MATH and DepthQA tasks. Our results show that the framework effectively provides insights into LLM performance, including the quality of initial responses, adaptability to feedback, and ability to address follow-up queries like clarification or additional knowledge requests. The framework also addresses key limitations of conventional methods like LLM-as-a-Judge, including verbosity bias and inconsistency across runs. Finally, we propose the Interview Report, which aggregates insights from the interview process, providing examples and a comprehensive analysis of the LLM's strengths and weaknesses. This report offers a detailed snapshot of the model's real-world applicability. The code for our framework is publicly available at https://github.com/interview-eval/.</p></details> |  |

We introduce $\textbf{LLM-BabyBench}$, a new benchmark suite designed specifically for this purpose. Built upon a textual adaptation of the procedurally generated BabyAI grid world, this suite evaluates LLMs on three fundamental aspects of grounded intelligence: (1) predicting the consequences of actions on the environment state ($\textbf{Predict}$ task), (2) generating sequences of low-level actions to achieve specified objectives ($\textbf{Plan}$ task), and (3) decomposing high-level instructions into coherent subgoal sequences ($\textbf{Decompose}$ task). We detail the methodology for generating the three corresponding datasets ($\texttt{LLM-BabyBench-Predict}$, $\texttt{-Plan}$, $\texttt{-Decompose}$) by extracting structured information from an expert agent operating within the text-based environment. Furthermore, we provide a standardized evaluation harness and metrics, including environment interaction for validating generated plans, to facilitate reproducible assessment of diverse LLMs. Initial baseline results highlight the challenges posed by these grounded reasoning tasks. The benchmark suite, datasets, data generation code, and evaluation code are made publicly available ($\href{https://github.com/choukrani/llm-babybench}{\text{GitHub}}$, $\href{https://huggingface.co/datasets/salem-mbzuai/LLM-BabyBench}{\text{HuggingFace}}$).</p></details> |  |
| **[Asynchronous LLM Function Calling](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.07017v1)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) use function calls to interface with external tools and data source. However, the current approach to LLM function calling is inherently synchronous, where each call blocks LLM inference, limiting LLM operation and concurrent function execution. In this work, we propose AsyncLM, a system for asynchronous LLM function calling. AsyncLM improves LLM's operational efficiency by enabling LLMs to generate and execute function calls concurrently. Instead of waiting for each call's completion, AsyncLM introduces an interrupt mechanism to asynchronously notify the LLM in-flight when function calls return. We design an in-context protocol for function calls and interrupts, provide fine-tuning strategy to adapt LLMs to the interrupt semantics, and implement these mechanisms efficiently on LLM inference process. We demonstrate that AsyncLM can reduce end-to-end task completion latency from 1.6x-5.4x compared to synchronous function calling on a set of benchmark tasks in the Berkeley function calling leaderboard (BFCL). Furthermore, we discuss how interrupt mechanisms can be extended to enable novel human-LLM or LLM-LLM interactions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tuning LLMs by RAG Principles: Towards LLM-native Memory](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.16071v1)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Memory, additional information beyond the training of large language models (LLMs), is crucial to various real-world applications, such as personal assistant. The two mainstream solutions to incorporate memory into the generation process are long-context LLMs and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). In this paper, we first systematically compare these two types of solutions on three renovated/new datasets and show that (1) long-context solutions, although more expensive, shall be easier to capture the big picture and better answer queries which require considering the memory as a whole; and (2) when the queries concern specific information, RAG solutions shall be more competitive especially when the keywords can be explicitly matched. Therefore, we propose a novel method RAG-Tuned-LLM which fine-tunes a relative small (e.g., 7B) LLM using the data generated following the RAG principles, so it can combine the advantages of both solutions. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate that RAG-Tuned-LLM can beat long-context LLMs and RAG methods across a wide range of query types.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Multi-LLM Debiasing Framework](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.13884v1)** | 2024-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful tools with the potential to benefit society immensely, yet, they have demonstrated biases that perpetuate societal inequalities. Despite significant advancements in bias mitigation techniques using data augmentation, zero-shot prompting, and model fine-tuning, biases continuously persist, including subtle biases that may elude human detection. Recent research has shown a growing interest in multi-LLM approaches, which have been demonstrated to be effective in improving the quality of reasoning and factuality in LLMs. Building on this approach, we propose a novel multi-LLM debiasing framework aimed at reducing bias in LLMs. Our work is the first to introduce and evaluate two distinct approaches within this framework for debiasing LLMs: a centralized method, where the conversation is facilitated by a single central LLM, and a decentralized method, where all models communicate directly. Our findings reveal that our multi-LLM framework significantly reduces bias in LLMs, outperforming the baseline method across several social groups.</p></details> |  |

Meanwhile, much less attention has been given to mitigating the costs associated with deploying multiple LLMs of varying sizes despite its practical significance. Thus, this paper introduces \emph{any-precision LLM}, extending the concept of any-precision DNN to LLMs. Addressing challenges in any-precision LLM, we propose a lightweight method for any-precision quantization of LLMs, leveraging a post-training quantization framework, and develop a specialized software engine for its efficient serving. As a result, our solution significantly reduces the high costs of deploying multiple, different-sized LLMs by overlaying LLMs quantized to varying bit-widths, such as 3, 4, ..., $n$ bits, into a memory footprint comparable to a single $n$-bit LLM. All the supported LLMs with varying bit-widths demonstrate state-of-the-art model quality and inference throughput, proving itself to be a compelling option for deployment of multiple, different-sized LLMs. Our code is open-sourced and available online.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at ICML 2024.

We present LLM Attributor, a Python library that provides interactive visualizations for training data attribution of an LLM's text generation. Our library offers a new way to quickly attribute an LLM's text generation to training data points to inspect model behaviors, enhance its trustworthiness, and compare model-generated text with user-provided text. We describe the visual and interactive design of our tool and highlight usage scenarios for LLaMA2 models fine-tuned with two different datasets: online articles about recent disasters and finance-related question-answer pairs. Thanks to LLM Attributor's broad support for computational notebooks, users can easily integrate it into their workflow to interactively visualize attributions of their models.

| **[LLM-Evaluation Tropes: Perspectives on the Validity of LLM-Evaluations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.19076v1)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to evaluate information retrieval (IR) systems, generating relevance judgments traditionally made by human assessors. Recent empirical studies suggest that LLM-based evaluations often align with human judgments, leading some to suggest that human judges may no longer be necessary, while others highlight concerns about judgment reliability, validity, and long-term impact. As IR systems begin incorporating LLM-generated signals, evaluation outcomes risk becoming self-reinforcing, potentially leading to misleading conclusions. This paper examines scenarios where LLM-evaluators may falsely indicate success, particularly when LLM-based judgments influence both system development and evaluation. We highlight key risks, including bias reinforcement, reproducibility challenges, and inconsistencies in assessment methodologies. To address these concerns, we propose tests to quantify adverse effects, guardrails, and a collaborative framework for constructing reusable test collections that integrate LLM judgments responsibly. By providing perspectives from academia and industry, this work aims to establish best practices for the principled use of LLMs in IR evaluation.</p></details> |  |

Existing works aim to enhance LLM capabilities via domain-specific adaptation, which require additional training on accessible model parameters, an infeasible option for black-box LLMs. To address this challenge, we introduce Matryoshka Pilot (M-Pilot), a lightweight white-box LLM controller that guides a large-scale black-box LLM generator by decomposing complex tasks into a series of intermediate outputs. Specifically, we consider the black-box LLM as an environment, with M-Pilot serving as a policy to provide intermediate guidance through prompts for driving the black-box LLM. M-Pilot is trained to pivot the outputs of the black-box LLM aligning with preferences during iterative interaction, which enables controllable multi-turn generation and self-improvement in optimizing intermediate guidance. Empirical evaluations on diverse tasks demonstrate that our method effectively enhances the capabilities of black-box LLMs in complex, long-horizon tasks.

Cybersecurity is one of the key sectors where LLMs can be and/or are already being used. There are a number of problems that inhibit the adoption of trustworthy Gen AI and LLMs in cybersecurity and such other critical areas. One of the key challenge to the trustworthiness and reliability of LLMs is: how consistent an LLM is in its responses? In this paper, we have analyzed and developed a formal definition of consistency of responses of LLMs. We have formally defined what is consistency of responses and then develop a framework for consistency evaluation. The paper proposes two approaches to validate consistency: self-validation, and validation across multiple LLMs. We have carried out extensive experiments for several LLMs such as GPT4oMini, GPT3.5, Gemini, Cohere, and Llama3, on a security benchmark consisting of several cybersecurity questions: informational and situational. Our experiments corroborate the fact that even though these LLMs are being considered and/or already being used for several cybersecurity tasks today, they are often inconsistent in their responses, and thus are untrustworthy and unreliable for cybersecurity.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 12 figures, 3 tables, 3 algorithms, 2024 IEEE 6th International Conference on Trust, Privacy and Security in Intelligent Systems, and Applications (TPS-ISA), Washington, DC, USA</p></details> |

However, as trends continue to push for expanding context sizes, the autoregressive nature of LLMs results in highly dynamic behavior of the attention layers, showcasing significant differences in computational characteristics and memory requirements from the non-attention layers. This presents substantial challenges for resource management and performance optimization in service systems. Existing static model parallelism and resource allocation strategies fall short when dealing with this dynamicity. To address the issue, we propose Infinite-LLM, a novel LLM serving system designed to effectively handle dynamic context lengths. Infinite-LLM disaggregates attention layers from an LLM's inference process, facilitating flexible and independent resource scheduling that optimizes computational performance and enhances memory utilization jointly. By leveraging a pooled GPU memory strategy across a cluster, Infinite-LLM not only significantly boosts system throughput but also supports extensive context lengths. Evaluated on a dataset with context lengths ranging from a few to 2000K tokens across a cluster with 32 A100 GPUs, Infinite-LLM demonstrates throughput improvement of 1.35-3.4x compared to state-of-the-art methods, enabling efficient and elastic LLM deployment.</p></details> |  |

Compared to human evaluators, the use of LLMs to support performance evaluation offers a more efficient alternative. However, most studies focus mainly on aligning LLMs' judgments with human preferences, overlooking the existence of biases and mistakes in human judgment. Furthermore, how to select suitable LLM judgments given multiple potential LLM responses remains underexplored. To address these two aforementioned issues, we propose a three-stage meta-judge selection pipeline: 1) developing a comprehensive rubric with GPT-4 and human experts, 2) using three advanced LLM agents to score judgments, and 3) applying a threshold to filter out low-scoring judgments. Compared to methods using a single LLM as both judge and meta-judge, our pipeline introduces multi-agent collaboration and a more comprehensive rubric. Experimental results on the JudgeBench dataset show about 15.55\% improvement compared to raw judgments and about 8.37\% improvement over the single-agent baseline. Our work demonstrates the potential of LLMs as meta-judges and lays the foundation for future research on constructing preference datasets for LLM-as-a-judge reinforcement learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 5 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |
| **[From LLMs to Agents: A Comparative Evaluation of LLMs and LLM-based Agents in Security Patch Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.08060v1)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread adoption of open-source software (OSS) has accelerated software innovation but also increased security risks due to the rapid propagation of vulnerabilities and silent patch releases. In recent years, large language models (LLMs) and LLM-based agents have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in various software engineering (SE) tasks, enabling them to effectively address software security challenges such as vulnerability detection. However, systematic evaluation of the capabilities of LLMs and LLM-based agents in security patch detection remains limited. To bridge this gap, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the performance of LLMs and LLM-based agents for security patch detection. Specifically, we investigate three methods: Plain LLM (a single LLM with a system prompt), Data-Aug LLM (data augmentation based on the Plain LLM), and the ReAct Agent (leveraging the thought-action-observation mechanism). We also evaluate the performance of both commercial and open-source LLMs under these methods and compare these results with those of existing baselines. Furthermore, we analyze the detection performance of these methods across various vulnerability types, and examine the impact of different prompting strategies and context window sizes on the results. Our findings reveal that the Data-Aug LLM achieves the best overall performance, whereas the ReAct Agent demonstrates the lowest false positive rate (FPR). Although baseline methods exhibit strong accuracy, their false positive rates are significantly higher. In contrast, our evaluated methods achieve comparable accuracy while substantially reducing the FPR. These findings provide valuable insights into the practical applications of LLMs and LLM-based agents in security patch detection, highlighting their advantage in maintaining robust performance while minimizing false positive rates.</p></details> |  |

While researchers have explored the potential of LLMs in various domains, this paper focuses on their use in programming tasks, drawing insights from user studies that assess the impact of LLMs on programming tasks. We first examined the user interaction behaviors with LLMs observed in these studies, from the types of requests made to task completion strategies. Additionally, our analysis reveals both benefits and weaknesses of LLMs showing mixed effects on the human and task. Lastly, we looked into what factors from the human, LLM or the interaction of both, affect the human's enhancement as well as the task performance. Our findings highlight the variability in human-LLM interactions due to the non-deterministic nature of both parties (humans and LLMs), underscoring the need for a deeper understanding of these interaction patterns. We conclude by providing some practical suggestions for researchers as well as programmers.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 8 tables, 2 figures</p></details> |

However, challenges arise in assessing LLM-as-a-tutor due to differing standards between educational and general use cases. To bridge this gap, we integrate pedagogical principles to assess student-LLM interaction. First, we explore how LLMs can function as English tutors, providing effective essay feedback tailored to students. Second, we propose three metrics to evaluate LLM-as-a-tutor specifically designed for EFL writing education, emphasizing pedagogical aspects. In this process, EFL experts evaluate the feedback from LLM-as-a-tutor regarding quality and characteristics. On the other hand, EFL learners assess their learning outcomes from interaction with LLM-as-a-tutor. This approach lays the groundwork for developing LLMs-as-a-tutor tailored to the needs of EFL learners, advancing the effectiveness of writing education in this context.</p></details> |  |

By reasoning about traffic patterns in both the spatial and temporal dimensions, accurate and interpretable predictions can be provided. A considerable challenge in traffic prediction lies in handling the diverse data distributions caused by vastly different traffic conditions occurring at different locations. LLMs have been a dominant solution due to their remarkable capacity to adapt to new datasets with very few labeled data samples, i.e., few-shot adaptability. However, existing forecasting techniques mainly focus on extracting local graph information and forming a text-like prompt, leaving LLM- based traffic prediction an open problem. This work presents a probabilistic LLM for traffic forecasting with three highlights. We propose a graph-aware LLM for traffic prediction that considers proximal traffic information. Specifically, by considering the traffic of neighboring nodes as covariates, our model outperforms the corresponding time-series LLM. Furthermore, we adopt a lightweight approach for efficient domain adaptation when facing new data distributions in few-shot fashion. The comparative experiment demonstrates the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art LLM-based methods and the traditional GNN- based supervised approaches. Furthermore, Strada-LLM can be easily adapted to different LLM backbones without a noticeable performance drop.</p></details> | <details><summary>The r...</summary><p>The reviewers decided to reject it.

However, there is still a gap between LLMs being capable coders and being top-tier software engineers. Based on the observation that top-level software engineers often ask clarifying questions to reduce ambiguity in both requirements and coding solutions, we argue that the same should be applied to LLMs for code generation tasks. In this work, we conducted an empirical study on the benchmark and analysis of the communication skills of LLMs for code generation. We define communication skills of LLMs as ``being able to ask clarifying questions when the description of the code generation problem has issues''. We created a new benchmark, HumanEvalComm, by modifying problem descriptions according to three issues: inconsistency, ambiguity, incompleteness. We defined new evaluation metrics such as Communication Rate and Good Question Rate, and then experimented on HumanEvalComm with different Code LLMs, and a new LLM agent approach, Okanagan, to identify and ask questions in ambiguous parts from code and descriptions for further refining the generated code. Finally, we discussed evaluation results by comparing Code LLMs and Okanagan with our findings.</p></details> | <details><summary>42 pa...</summary><p>42 pages, 6 figures, 16 tables.

It is therefore encouraging to see the growing interest in LLM personalization within the research community. However, current works often rely on the LLM-as-a-Judge approach for evaluation without thoroughly examining its validity. In this paper, we investigate the reliability of LLM-as-a-Personalized-Judge, asking LLMs to judge user preferences based on personas. Our findings suggest that directly applying LLM-as-a-Personalized-Judge is less reliable than previously assumed, showing low and inconsistent agreement with human ground truth. The personas typically used are often overly simplistic, resulting in low predictive power. To address these issues, we introduce verbal uncertainty estimation into the LLM-as-a-Personalized-Judge pipeline, allowing the model to express low confidence on uncertain judgments. This adjustment leads to much higher agreement (above 80%) on high-certainty samples for binary tasks. Through human evaluation, we find that the LLM-as-a-Personalized-Judge achieves comparable performance to third-party humans evaluation and even surpasses human performance on high-certainty samples. Our work indicates that certainty-enhanced LLM-as-a-Personalized-Judge offers a promising direction for developing more reliable and scalable methods for evaluating LLM personalization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our c...</summary><p>Our code is available at https://github.com/dong-river/Personalized-Judge</p></details> |

However, the stochastic nature and tendency for hallucinations in LLMs can undermine both quality of learning experience and adherence to ethical standards. To address this concern, we propose a method that uses LLM feedback evaluators (DeanLLMs) to automatically and comprehensively evaluate feedback generated by LLM tutor for submissions on university assignments before it is delivered to students. This allows low-quality feedback to be rejected and enables LLM tutors to improve the feedback they generated based on the evaluation results. We first proposed a comprehensive evaluation framework for LLM-generated educational feedback, comprising six dimensions for feedback content, seven for feedback effectiveness, and three for hallucination types. Next, we generated a virtual assignment submission dataset covering 85 university assignments from 43 computer science courses using eight commonly used commercial LLMs. We labelled and open-sourced the assignment dataset to support the fine-tuning and evaluation of LLM feedback evaluators. Our findings show that o3-pro demonstrated the best performance in zero-shot labelling of feedback while o4-mini demonstrated the best performance in few-shot labelling of feedback. Moreover, GPT-4.1 achieved human expert level performance after fine-tuning (Accuracy 79.8%, F1-score 79.4%; human average Accuracy 78.3%, F1-score 82.6%). Finally, we used our best-performance model to evaluate 2,000 assignment feedback instances generated by 10 common commercial LLMs, 200 each, to compare the quality of feedback generated by different LLMs. Our LLM feedback evaluator method advances our ability to automatically provide high-quality and reliable educational feedback to students.</p></details> |  |

Replicating Crowdsourcing Pipelines with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.10168v3)** | 2025-01-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs have shown promise in replicating human-like behavior in crowdsourcing tasks that were previously thought to be exclusive to human abilities. However, current efforts focus mainly on simple atomic tasks. We explore whether LLMs can replicate more complex crowdsourcing pipelines. We find that modern LLMs can simulate some of crowdworkers' abilities in these ``human computation algorithms,'' but the level of success is variable and influenced by requesters' understanding of LLM capabilities, the specific skills required for sub-tasks, and the optimal interaction modality for performing these sub-tasks. We reflect on human and LLMs' different sensitivities to instructions, stress the importance of enabling human-facing safeguards for LLMs, and discuss the potential of training humans and LLMs with complementary skill sets. Crucially, we show that replicating crowdsourcing pipelines offers a valuable platform to investigate 1) the relative LLM strengths on different tasks (by cross-comparing their performances on sub-tasks) and 2) LLMs' potential in complex tasks, where they can complete part of the tasks while leaving others to humans.</p></details> |  |
| **[BED-LLM: Intelligent Information Gathering with LLMs and Bayesian Experimental Design](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.21184v2)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a general-purpose approach for improving the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to intelligently and adaptively gather information from a user or other external source using the framework of sequential Bayesian experimental design (BED). This enables LLMs to act as effective multi-turn conversational agents and interactively interface with external environments. Our approach, which we call BED-LLM (Bayesian Experimental Design with Large Language Models), is based on iteratively choosing questions or queries that maximize the expected information gain (EIG) about the task of interest given the responses gathered previously. We show how this EIG can be formulated (and then estimated) in a principled way using a probabilistic model derived from the LLM's predictive distributions and provide detailed insights into key decisions in its construction and updating procedure. We find that BED-LLM achieves substantial gains in performance across a wide range of tests based on the 20 questions game and using the LLM to actively infer user preferences, compared to direct prompting of the LLM and other adaptive design strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-Cure: LLM-based Competitor User Review Analysis for Feature Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.15724v2)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The exponential growth of the mobile app market underscores the importance of constant innovation and rapid response to user demands. As user satisfaction is paramount to the success of a mobile application (app), developers typically rely on user reviews, which represent user feedback that includes ratings and comments to identify areas for improvement. However, the sheer volume of user reviews poses challenges in manual analysis, necessitating automated approaches. Existing automated approaches either analyze only the target apps reviews, neglecting the comparison of similar features to competitors or fail to provide suggestions for feature enhancement. To address these gaps, we propose a Large Language Model (LLM)-based Competitive User Review Analysis for Feature Enhancement) (LLM-Cure), an approach powered by LLMs to automatically generate suggestion s for mobile app feature improvements. More specifically, LLM-Cure identifies and categorizes features within reviews by applying LLMs. When provided with a complaint in a user review, LLM-Cure curates highly rated (4 and 5 stars) reviews in competing apps related to the complaint and proposes potential improvements tailored to the target application. We evaluate LLM-Cure on 1,056,739 reviews of 70 popular Android apps. Our evaluation demonstrates that LLM-Cure significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in assigning features to reviews by up to 13% in F1-score, up to 16% in recall and up to 11% in precision. Additionally, LLM-Cure demonstrates its capability to provide suggestions for resolving user complaints. We verify the suggestions using the release notes that reflect the changes of features in the target mobile app. LLM-Cure achieves a promising average of 73% of the implementation of the provided suggestions.</p></details> | 25 pages |

An Empirical Investigation of LLM's Hidden States](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.09733v1)** | 2024-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) can make up answers that are not real, and this is known as hallucination. This research aims to see if, how, and to what extent LLMs are aware of hallucination. More specifically, we check whether and how an LLM reacts differently in its hidden states when it answers a question right versus when it hallucinates. To do this, we introduce an experimental framework which allows examining LLM's hidden states in different hallucination situations. Building upon this framework, we conduct a series of experiments with language models in the LLaMA family (Touvron et al., 2023). Our empirical findings suggest that LLMs react differently when processing a genuine response versus a fabricated one. We then apply various model interpretation techniques to help understand and explain the findings better. Moreover, informed by the empirical observations, we show great potential of using the guidance derived from LLM's hidden representation space to mitigate hallucination. We believe this work provides insights into how LLMs produce hallucinated answers and how to make them occur less often.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 8 figures, 2 tables (13 pages, 12 figures, 13 tables including references and appendices)</p></details> |
| **[The Lottery LLM Hypothesis, Rethinking What Abilities Should LLM Compression Preserve?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.17535v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivated by reducing the computational and storage costs of LLMs, model compression and KV cache compression have attracted much attention from researchers. However, current methods predominantly emphasize maintaining the performance of compressed LLMs, as measured by perplexity or simple accuracy on tasks of common sense knowledge QA and basic arithmetic reasoning. In this blog, we present a brief review of recent advancements in LLMs related to retrieval-augmented generation, multi-step reasoning, external tools, and computational expressivity, all of which substantially enhance LLM performance. Then, we propose a lottery LLM hypothesis suggesting that for a given LLM and task, there exists a smaller lottery LLM capable of producing the same performance as the original LLM with the assistance of multi-step reasoning and external tools. Based on the review of current progress in LLMs, we discuss and summarize the essential capabilities that the lottery LLM and KV cache compression must possess, which are currently overlooked in existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-AutoDiff: Auto-Differentiate Any LLM Workflow](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.16673v2)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have reshaped natural language processing, powering applications from multi-hop retrieval and question answering to autonomous agent workflows. Yet, prompt engineering -- the task of crafting textual inputs to effectively direct LLMs -- remains difficult and labor-intensive, particularly for complex pipelines that combine multiple LLM calls with functional operations like retrieval and data formatting. We introduce LLM-AutoDiff: a novel framework for Automatic Prompt Engineering (APE) that extends textual gradient-based methods (such as Text-Grad) to multi-component, potentially cyclic LLM architectures. Implemented within the AdalFlow library, LLM-AutoDiff treats each textual input as a trainable parameter and uses a frozen backward engine LLM to generate feedback-akin to textual gradients -- that guide iterative prompt updates. Unlike prior single-node approaches, LLM-AutoDiff inherently accommodates functional nodes, preserves time-sequential behavior in repeated calls (e.g., multi-hop loops), and combats the "lost-in-the-middle" problem by isolating distinct sub-prompts (instructions, formats, or few-shot examples). It further boosts training efficiency by focusing on error-prone samples through selective gradient computation. Across diverse tasks, including single-step classification, multi-hop retrieval-based QA, and agent-driven pipelines, LLM-AutoDiff consistently outperforms existing textual gradient baselines in both accuracy and training cost. By unifying prompt optimization through a graph-centric lens, LLM-AutoDiff offers a powerful new paradigm for scaling and automating LLM workflows - mirroring the transformative role that automatic differentiation libraries have long played in neural network research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Performance Gains of LLMs With Humans in a World of LLMs Versus Humans](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.08902v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Currently, a considerable research effort is devoted to comparing LLMs to a group of human experts, where the term "expert" is often ill-defined or variable, at best, in a state of constantly updating LLM releases. Without proper safeguards in place, LLMs will threaten to cause harm to the established structure of safe delivery of patient care which has been carefully developed throughout history to keep the safety of the patient at the forefront. A key driver of LLM innovation is founded on community research efforts which, if continuing to operate under "humans versus LLMs" principles, will expedite this trend. Therefore, research efforts moving forward must focus on effectively characterizing the safe use of LLMs in clinical settings that persist across the rapid development of novel LLM models. In this communication, we demonstrate that rather than comparing LLMs to humans, there is a need to develop strategies enabling efficient work of humans with LLMs in an almost symbiotic manner.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Audit and Analysis of LLM-Assisted Health Misinformation Jailbreaks Against LLMs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.10010v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are a double-edged sword capable of generating harmful misinformation -- inadvertently, or when prompted by "jailbreak" attacks that attempt to produce malicious outputs. LLMs could, with additional research, be used to detect and prevent the spread of misinformation. In this paper, we investigate the efficacy and characteristics of LLM-produced jailbreak attacks that cause other models to produce harmful medical misinformation. We also study how misinformation generated by jailbroken LLMs compares to typical misinformation found on social media, and how effectively it can be detected using standard machine learning approaches. Specifically, we closely examine 109 distinct attacks against three target LLMs and compare the attack prompts to in-the-wild health-related LLM queries. We also examine the resulting jailbreak responses, comparing the generated misinformation to health-related misinformation on Reddit. Our findings add more evidence that LLMs can be effectively used to detect misinformation from both other LLMs and from people, and support a body of work suggesting that with careful design, LLMs can contribute to a healthier overall information ecosystem.</p></details> |  |
| **[User-LLM: Efficient LLM Contextualization with User Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13598v2)** | 2024-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across various domains, but effectively incorporating complex and potentially noisy user timeline data into LLMs remains a challenge. Current approaches often involve translating user timelines into text descriptions before feeding them to LLMs, which can be inefficient and may not fully capture the nuances of user behavior. Inspired by how LLMs are effectively integrated with images through direct embeddings, we propose User-LLM, a novel framework that leverages user embeddings to directly contextualize LLMs with user history interactions. These embeddings, generated by a user encoder pretrained using self-supervised learning on diverse user interactions, capture latent user behaviors and interests as well as their evolution over time. We integrate these user embeddings with LLMs through cross-attention, enabling LLMs to dynamically adapt their responses based on the context of a user's past actions and preferences. Our approach achieves significant efficiency gains by representing user timelines directly as embeddings, leading to substantial inference speedups of up to 78.1X. Comprehensive experiments on MovieLens, Amazon Review, and Google Local Review datasets demonstrate that User-LLM outperforms text-prompt-based contextualization on tasks requiring deep user understanding, with improvements of up to 16.33%, particularly excelling on long sequences that capture subtle shifts in user behavior. Furthermore, the incorporation of Perceiver layers streamlines the integration between user encoders and LLMs, yielding additional computational savings.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLMs Can't Plan, But Can Help Planning in LLM-Modulo Frameworks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01817v3)** | 2024-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There is considerable confusion about the role of Large Language Models (LLMs) in planning and reasoning tasks. On one side are over-optimistic claims that LLMs can indeed do these tasks with just the right prompting or self-verification strategies. On the other side are perhaps over-pessimistic claims that all that LLMs are good for in planning/reasoning tasks are as mere translators of the problem specification from one syntactic format to another, and ship the problem off to external symbolic solvers. In this position paper, we take the view that both these extremes are misguided. We argue that auto-regressive LLMs cannot, by themselves, do planning or self-verification (which is after all a form of reasoning), and shed some light on the reasons for misunderstandings in the literature. We will also argue that LLMs should be viewed as universal approximate knowledge sources that have much more meaningful roles to play in planning/reasoning tasks beyond simple front-end/back-end format translators. We present a vision of {\bf LLM-Modulo Frameworks} that combine the strengths of LLMs with external model-based verifiers in a tighter bi-directional interaction regime. We will show how the models driving the external verifiers themselves can be acquired with the help of LLMs. We will also argue that rather than simply pipelining LLMs and symbolic components, this LLM-Modulo Framework provides a better neuro-symbolic approach that offers tighter integration between LLMs and symbolic components, and allows extending the scope of model-based planning/reasoning regimes towards more flexible knowledge, problem and preference specifications.</p></details> |  |

Large language models (LLMs), trained on vast corpora, have shown strong potential in data generation, making them a promising tool for data imputation. However, challenges persist in designing effective prompts for a finetuning-free process and in mitigating biases and uncertainty in LLM outputs. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework, LLM-Forest, which introduces a "forest" of few-shot prompt learning LLM "trees" with their outputs aggregated via confidence-based weighted voting based on LLM self-assessment, inspired by the ensemble learning (Random Forest). This framework is established on a new concept of bipartite information graphs to identify high-quality relevant neighboring entries with both feature and value granularity. Extensive experiments on 9 real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of LLM-Forest.</p></details> |  |

A novel approach involves using the LLM itself to make evaluation and stabilizing the results through multiple independent evaluations, similar to a single-layer narrow LLM network. This network consists of a fixed number of neurons, with each neuron being the same LLM. In this paper, we draw upon the extensive research on deep neural networks to explore whether deeper and wider networks can lead to fairer evaluations. Specifically, inspired by the observation that different neurons in a neural network are responsible for detecting different concepts, we first adaptively generate as many neuron roles as possible for each evaluation sample. Each perspective corresponds to the role of a specific LLM neuron in the first layer. In subsequent layers, we follow the idea that higher layers in deep networks are responsible for more comprehensive features, each layer receives representations from all neurons in the previous layer, integrating the locally learned evaluation information to obtain a more comprehensive evaluation result. Interestingly, this network design resembles the process of academic paper reviewing. To validate the effectiveness of our method, we construct the largest and most diverse English evaluation benchmark LLMEval$^2$ for LLM evaluators, comprising 15 tasks, 8 abilities, and 2,553 samples. Experimental results demonstrate that a wider network (involving many reviewers) with 2 layers (one round of discussion) performs the best, improving kappa correlation coefficient from 0.28 to 0.34. We also leverage WideDeep to aid in the assessment of Chinese LLMs, which has accelerated the evaluation time by 4.6 times, resulting in a 60% cost saving. WideDeep achieves a remarkable 93% agreement level among humans.</p></details> | Work in Progress |

An Empirical Study of LLM-as-a-Judge in Software Engineering](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.06193v3)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been deployed to tackle various software engineering (SE) tasks like code generation, significantly advancing the automation of SE tasks. However, assessing the quality of these LLM-generated code and text remains challenging. The commonly used Pass@k metric necessitates extensive unit tests and configured environments, demands a high labor cost, and is not suitable for evaluating LLM-generated text. Conventional metrics like BLEU, which measure only lexical rather than semantic similarity, have also come under scrutiny. In response, a new trend has emerged to employ LLMs for automated evaluation, known as LLM-as-a-judge. These LLM-as-a-judge methods are claimed to better mimic human assessment than conventional metrics without relying on high-quality reference answers. Nevertheless, their exact human alignment in SE tasks remains unexplored. In this paper, we empirically explore LLM-as-a-judge methods for evaluating SE tasks, focusing on their alignment with human judgments. We select seven LLM-as-a-judge methods that utilize general-purpose LLMs, alongside two LLMs specifically fine-tuned for evaluation. After generating and manually scoring LLM responses on three recent SE datasets of code translation, code generation, and code summarization, we then prompt these methods to evaluate each response. Finally, we compare the scores generated by these methods with human evaluation. The results indicate that output-based methods reach the highest Pearson correlation of 81.32 and 68.51 with human scores in code translation and generation, achieving near-human evaluation, noticeably outperforming ChrF++, one of the best conventional metrics, at 34.23 and 64.92. Such output-based methods prompt LLMs to output judgments directly, and exhibit more balanced score distributions that resemble human score patterns.

Investigating Vulnerabilities in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.20529v1)** | 2024-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has garnered significant popularity and wielded immense power across various domains within Natural Language Processing (NLP). While their capabilities are undeniably impressive, it is crucial to identify and scrutinize their vulnerabilities especially when those vulnerabilities can have costly consequences. One such LLM, trained to provide a concise summarization from medical documents could unequivocally leak personal patient data when prompted surreptitiously. This is just one of many unfortunate examples that have been unveiled and further research is necessary to comprehend the underlying reasons behind such vulnerabilities. In this study, we delve into multiple sections of vulnerabilities which are model-based, training-time, inference-time vulnerabilities, and discuss mitigation strategies including "Model Editing" which aims at modifying LLMs behavior, and "Chroma Teaming" which incorporates synergy of multiple teaming strategies to enhance LLMs' resilience. This paper will synthesize the findings from each vulnerability section and propose new directions of research and development. By understanding the focal points of current vulnerabilities, we can better anticipate and mitigate future risks, paving the road for more robust and secure LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 1 figure. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2403.12503</p></details> |

To improve human evaluation ability and overcome that limitation this work trains "critic" models that help humans to more accurately evaluate model-written code. These critics are themselves LLMs trained with RLHF to write natural language feedback highlighting problems in code from real-world assistant tasks. On code containing naturally occurring LLM errors model-written critiques are preferred over human critiques in 63% of cases, and human evaluation finds that models catch more bugs than human contractors paid for code review. We further confirm that our fine-tuned LLM critics can successfully identify hundreds of errors in ChatGPT training data rated as "flawless", even though the majority of those tasks are non-code tasks and thus out-of-distribution for the critic model. Critics can have limitations of their own, including hallucinated bugs that could mislead humans into making mistakes they might have otherwise avoided, but human-machine teams of critics and contractors catch similar numbers of bugs to LLM critics while hallucinating less than LLMs alone.</p></details> |  |

This centralization, coupled with the scarcity of high-quality training data and mounting complexity of maintaining comprehensive expertise across rapidly expanding knowledge domains, poses critical challenges to the continued growth of LLMs. While solutions like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offer potential remedies, maintaining up-to-date expert knowledge across diverse domains remains a significant challenge, particularly given the exponential growth of specialized information. This paper introduces LLMs Networks (LLM-Net), a blockchain-based framework that democratizes LLMs-as-a-Service through a decentralized network of specialized LLM providers. By leveraging collective computational resources and distributed domain expertise, LLM-Net incorporates fine-tuned expert models for various specific domains, ensuring sustained knowledge growth while maintaining service quality through collaborative prompting mechanisms. The framework's robust design includes blockchain technology for transparent transaction and performance validation, establishing an immutable record of service delivery. Our simulation, built on top of state-of-the-art LLMs such as Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Llama 3.1, Grok-2, and GPT-4o, validates the effectiveness of the reputation-based mechanism in maintaining service quality by selecting high-performing respondents (LLM providers). Thereby it demonstrates the potential of LLM-Net to sustain AI advancement through the integration of decentralized expertise and blockchain-based accountability.</p></details> | 8 pages |

While large language models (LLMs) like GPT, LLAMA, and Gemini are far from error-free, they have shown promise in answering a variety of questions outside of security. We studied LLM performance in the area of end user security by qualitatively evaluating 3 popular LLMs on 900 systematically collected end user security questions. While LLMs demonstrate broad generalist ``knowledge'' of end user security information, there are patterns of errors and limitations across LLMs consisting of stale and inaccurate answers, and indirect or unresponsive communication styles, all of which impacts the quality of information received. Based on these patterns, we suggest directions for model improvement and recommend user strategies for interacting with LLMs when seeking assistance with security.</p></details> | 17 pages, 7 tables |

However, since LLM's content generation process is hardly controllable, current LLM-based agents frequently generate invalid or non-executable plans, which jeopardizes the performance of the generated plans and corrupts users' trust in LLM-based agents. In response, this paper proposes a novel "Formal-LLM" framework for LLM-based agents by integrating the expressiveness of natural language and the precision of formal language. Specifically, the framework allows agent developers to express their requirements or constraints for the planning process as an automaton. A stack-based LLM plan generation process is then conducted under the supervision of the automaton to ensure that the generated plan satisfies the constraints, making the planning process controllable. We conduct experiments on both benchmark tasks and practical real-life tasks, and our framework achieves over 50% overall performance increase, which validates the feasibility and effectiveness of employing Formal-LLM to guide the plan generation of agents, preventing the agents from generating invalid and unsuccessful plans. Further, more controllable LLM-based agents can facilitate the broader utilization of LLM in application scenarios where high validity of planning is essential.

(ii) We develop a diversity-optimized ensemble pruning algorithm to select the top-k sub-ensembles from a pool of $N$ base LLMs. Our pruning method recommends top-performing LLM subensembles of size $S$, often much smaller than $N$. (iii) We generate new output for each prompt query by utilizing a learn-to-ensemble approach, which learns to detect and resolve the output inconsistency among all component LLMs of an ensemble. Extensive evaluation on four different benchmarks shows good performance gain over the best LLM ensemble methods: (i) In constrained solution set problems, LLM-TOPLA outperforms the best-performing ensemble (Mixtral) by 2.2\% in accuracy on MMLU and the best-performing LLM ensemble (MoreAgent) on GSM8k by 2.1\%. (ii) In generative tasks, LLM-TOPLA outperforms the top-2 performers (Llama70b/Mixtral) on SearchQA by $3.9\mathrm{x}$ in F1, and on XSum by more than $38$ in ROUGE-1.

Mapping the Behavioral Biases of LLMs via Utility Theory](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.02784v1)** | 2024-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans are not homo economicus (i.e., rational economic beings). As humans, we exhibit systematic behavioral biases such as loss aversion, anchoring, framing, etc., which lead us to make suboptimal economic decisions. Insofar as such biases may be embedded in text data on which large language models (LLMs) are trained, to what extent are LLMs prone to the same behavioral biases? Understanding these biases in LLMs is crucial for deploying LLMs to support human decision-making. We propose utility theory-a paradigm at the core of modern economic theory-as an approach to evaluate the economic biases of LLMs. Utility theory enables the quantification and comparison of economic behavior against benchmarks such as perfect rationality or human behavior. To demonstrate our approach, we quantify and compare the economic behavior of a variety of open- and closed-source LLMs. We find that the economic behavior of current LLMs is neither entirely human-like nor entirely economicus-like. We also find that most current LLMs struggle to maintain consistent economic behavior across settings. Finally, we illustrate how our approach can measure the effect of interventions such as prompting on economic biases.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to COLM 2024</p></details> |

Moreover, providing security to LLM-based systems is a great challenge, as both traditional threats to software applications and threats targeting LLMs and their integration must be mitigated. In this survey, we shed light on security and privacy concerns of such LLM-based systems by performing a systematic review and comprehensive categorization of threats and defensive strategies considering the entire software and LLM life cycles. We analyze real-world scenarios with distinct characteristics of LLM usage, spanning from development to operation. In addition, threats are classified according to their severity level and to which scenarios they pertain, facilitating the identification of the most relevant threats. Recommended defense strategies are systematically categorized and mapped to the corresponding life cycle phase and possible attack strategies they attenuate. This work paves the way for consumers and vendors to understand and efficiently mitigate risks during integration of LLMs in their respective solutions or organizations. It also enables the research community to benefit from the discussion of open challenges and edge cases that may hinder the secure and privacy-preserving adoption of LLM-based systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>37 pa...</summary><p>37 pages, 8 figures, 13 tables</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose an efficient LLM inference pipeline that harnesses the power of LLMs. Our approach begins by tapping into the potential of LLMs to accurately perceive and predict the response length with minimal overhead. By leveraging this information, we introduce an efficient sequence scheduling technique that groups queries with similar response lengths into micro-batches. We evaluate our approach on real-world instruction datasets using the LLaMA-based model, and our results demonstrate an impressive 86% improvement in inference throughput without compromising effectiveness. Notably, our method is orthogonal to other inference acceleration techniques, making it a valuable addition to many existing toolkits (e.g., FlashAttention, Quantization) for LLM inference.</p></details> |  |

Notably, the disconnect between quantitative improvements on the overly academic leaderboard benchmarks and the qualitative impact of the models should be addressed. Furthermore, the benchmark suite is largely composed of translated versions of their English counterparts, which may not fully capture the intricacies of the Korean language. To address these issues, we propose Open Ko-LLM Leaderboard2, an improved version of the earlier Open Ko-LLM Leaderboard. The original benchmarks are entirely replaced with new tasks that are more closely aligned with real-world capabilities. Additionally, four new native Korean benchmarks are introduced to better reflect the distinct characteristics of the Korean language. Through these refinements, Open Ko-LLM Leaderboard2 seeks to provide a more meaningful evaluation for advancing Korean LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NAACL 2025 Industry</p></details> |

These models predominantly map visual information into language representation space, leveraging the vast knowledge and powerful text generation abilities of LLMs to produce multimodal instruction-following responses. We could term this method as LLMs for Vision because of its employing LLMs for visual-language understanding, yet observe that these MLLMs neglect the potential of harnessing visual knowledge to enhance overall capabilities of LLMs, which could be regraded as Vision Enhancing LLMs. In this paper, we propose an approach called MKS2, aimed at enhancing LLMs through empowering Multimodal Knowledge Storage and Sharing in LLMs. Specifically, we introduce the Modular Visual Memory, a component integrated into the internal blocks of LLMs, designed to store open-world visual information efficiently. Additionally, we present a soft Mixtures-of-Multimodal Experts architecture in LLMs to invoke multimodal knowledge collaboration during generation. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that MKS2 substantially augments the reasoning capabilities of LLMs in contexts necessitating physical or commonsense knowledge. It also delivers competitive results on multimodal benchmarks.</p></details> | 12 pages, 4 figures |

LLM-ARC employs an Actor-Critic method where the LLM Actor generates declarative logic programs along with tests for semantic correctness, while the Automated Reasoning Critic evaluates the code, runs the tests and provides feedback on test failures for iterative refinement. Implemented using Answer Set Programming (ASP), LLM-ARC achieves a new state-of-the-art accuracy of 88.32% on the FOLIO benchmark which tests complex logical reasoning capabilities. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements over LLM-only baselines, highlighting the importance of logic test generation and iterative self-refinement. We achieve our best result using a fully automated self-supervised training loop where the Actor is trained on end-to-end dialog traces with Critic feedback. We discuss potential enhancements and provide a detailed error analysis, showcasing the robustness and efficacy of LLM-ARC for complex natural language reasoning tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-I: LLMs are Naturally Interleaved Multimodal Creators](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.13642v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose LLM-Interleaved (LLM-I), a flexible and dynamic framework that reframes interleaved image-text generation as a tool-use problem. LLM-I is designed to overcome the "one-tool" bottleneck of current unified models, which are limited to synthetic imagery and struggle with tasks requiring factual grounding or programmatic precision. Our framework empowers a central LLM or MLLM agent to intelligently orchestrate a diverse toolkit of specialized visual tools, including online image search, diffusion-based generation, code execution, and image editing. The agent is trained to select and apply these tools proficiently via a Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework that features a hybrid reward system combining rule-based logic with judgments from LLM and MLLM evaluators. Trained on a diverse new dataset using four different model backbones, LLM-I demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods by a large margin across four benchmarks. We also introduce a novel test-time scaling strategy that provides further performance gains. Project Page: https://github.com/ByteDance-BandAI/LLM-I.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion LLMs are Natural Adversaries for any LLM](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.00203v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a novel framework that transforms the resource-intensive (adversarial) prompt optimization problem into an \emph{efficient, amortized inference task}. Our core insight is that pretrained, non-autoregressive generative LLMs, such as Diffusion LLMs, which model the joint distribution over prompt-response pairs, can serve as powerful surrogates for prompt search. This approach enables the direct conditional generation of prompts, effectively replacing costly, per-instance discrete optimization with a small number of parallelizable samples. We provide a probabilistic analysis demonstrating that under mild fidelity assumptions, only a few conditional samples are required to recover high-reward (harmful) prompts. Empirically, we find that the generated prompts are low-perplexity, diverse jailbreaks that exhibit strong transferability to a wide range of black-box target models, including robustly trained and proprietary LLMs. Beyond adversarial prompting, our framework opens new directions for red teaming, automated prompt optimization, and leveraging emerging Flow- and Diffusion-based LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Small LLMs Are Weak Tool Learners: A Multi-LLM Agent](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.07324v3)** | 2024-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM) agents significantly extend the capabilities of standalone LLMs, empowering them to interact with external tools (e.g., APIs, functions) and complete various tasks in a self-directed fashion. The challenge of tool use demands that LLMs not only understand user queries and generate answers accurately but also excel in task planning, tool invocation, and result summarization. While traditional works focus on training a single LLM with all these capabilities, performance limitations become apparent, particularly with smaller models. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel approach that decomposes the aforementioned capabilities into a planner, caller, and summarizer. Each component is implemented by a single LLM that focuses on a specific capability and collaborates with others to accomplish the task. This modular framework facilitates individual updates and the potential use of smaller LLMs for building each capability. To effectively train this framework, we introduce a two-stage training paradigm. First, we fine-tune a backbone LLM on the entire dataset without discriminating sub-tasks, providing the model with a comprehensive understanding of the task. Second, the fine-tuned LLM is used to instantiate the planner, caller, and summarizer respectively, which are continually fine-tuned on respective sub-tasks. Evaluation across various tool-use benchmarks illustrates that our proposed multi-LLM framework surpasses the traditional single-LLM approach, highlighting its efficacy and advantages in tool learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>On pr...</summary><p>On progress, github repo: https://github.com/X-PLUG/Multi-LLM-Agent</p></details> |

Despite progress in AI safety, current evaluations predominantly focus on adults, neglecting the unique vulnerabilities of minors engaging with generative AI. We introduce Safe-Child-LLM, a comprehensive benchmark and dataset for systematically assessing LLM safety across two developmental stages: children (7-12) and adolescents (13-17). Our framework includes a novel multi-part dataset of 200 adversarial prompts, curated from red-teaming corpora (e.g., SG-Bench, HarmBench), with human-annotated labels for jailbreak success and a standardized 0-5 ethical refusal scale. Evaluating leading LLMs -- including ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, LLaMA, DeepSeek, Grok, Vicuna, and Mistral -- we uncover critical safety deficiencies in child-facing scenarios. This work highlights the need for community-driven benchmarks to protect young users in LLM interactions. To promote transparency and collaborative advancement in ethical AI development, we are publicly releasing both our benchmark datasets and evaluation codebase at https://github.com/The-Responsible-AI-Initiative/Safe_Child_LLM_Benchmark.git</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-SQL-Solver: Can LLMs Determine SQL Equivalence?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.10321v4)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Judging the equivalence between two SQL queries is a fundamental problem with many practical applications in data management and SQL generation (i.e., evaluating the quality of generated SQL queries in text-to-SQL task). While the research community has reasoned about SQL equivalence for decades, it poses considerable difficulties and no complete solutions exist. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong reasoning capability in conversation, question answering and solving mathematics challenges. In this paper, we study if LLMs can be used to determine the equivalence between SQL queries under two notions of SQL equivalence (semantic equivalence and relaxed equivalence). To assist LLMs in generating high quality responses, we present two prompting techniques: Miniature & Mull and Explain & Compare. The former technique is used to evaluate the semantic equivalence in which it asks LLMs to execute a query on a simple database instance and then explore if a counterexample exists by modifying the database. The latter technique is used to evaluate the relaxed equivalence in which it asks LLMs to explain the queries and then compare if they contain significant logical differences. Our experiments demonstrate using our techniques, LLMs is a promising tool to help data engineers in writing semantically equivalent SQL queries, however challenges still persist, and is a better metric for evaluating SQL generation than the popular execution accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM Whisperer: An Inconspicuous Attack to Bias LLM Responses](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.04755v4)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Writing effective prompts for large language models (LLM) can be unintuitive and burdensome. In response, services that optimize or suggest prompts have emerged. While such services can reduce user effort, they also introduce a risk: the prompt provider can subtly manipulate prompts to produce heavily biased LLM responses. In this work, we show that subtle synonym replacements in prompts can increase the likelihood (by a difference up to 78%) that LLMs mention a target concept (e.g., a brand, political party, nation). We substantiate our observations through a user study, showing that our adversarially perturbed prompts 1) are indistinguishable from unaltered prompts by humans, 2) push LLMs to recommend target concepts more often, and 3) make users more likely to notice target concepts, all without arousing suspicion. The practicality of this attack has the potential to undermine user autonomy. Among other measures, we recommend implementing warnings against using prompts from untrusted parties.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLMs' Classification Performance is Overclaimed](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.16203v3)** | 2024-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In many classification tasks designed for AI or human to solve, gold labels are typically included within the label space by default, often posed as "which of the following is correct?" This standard setup has traditionally highlighted the strong performance of advanced AI, particularly top-performing Large Language Models (LLMs), in routine classification tasks. However, when the gold label is intentionally excluded from the label space, it becomes evident that LLMs still attempt to select from the available label candidates, even when none are correct. This raises a pivotal question: Do LLMs truly demonstrate their intelligence in understanding the essence of classification tasks? In this study, we evaluate both closed-source and open-source LLMs across representative classification tasks, arguing that the perceived performance of LLMs is overstated due to their inability to exhibit the expected comprehension of the task. This paper makes a threefold contribution: i) To our knowledge, this is the first work to identify the limitations of LLMs in classification tasks when gold labels are absent. We define this task as Classify-w/o-Gold and propose it as a new testbed for LLMs. ii) We introduce a benchmark, Know-No, comprising two existing classification tasks and one new task, to evaluate Classify-w/o-Gold. iii) This work defines and advocates for a new evaluation metric, OmniAccuracy, which assesses LLMs' performance in classification tasks both when gold labels are present and absent.</p></details> |  |
| **[Showing LLM-Generated Code Selectively Based on Confidence of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.03234v1)** | 2024-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive abilities in code generation, but they may generate erroneous programs. Reading a program takes ten times longer than writing it. Showing these erroneous programs to developers will waste developers' energies and introduce security risks to software. To address the above limitations, we propose HonestCoder, a novel LLM-based code generation approach. HonestCoder selectively shows the generated programs to developers based on LLMs' confidence. The confidence provides valuable insights into the correctness of generated programs. To achieve this goal, we propose a novel approach to estimate LLMs' confidence in code generation. It estimates confidence by measuring the multi-modal similarity between LLMs-generated programs. We collect and release a multilingual benchmark named TruthCodeBench, which consists of 2,265 samples and covers two popular programming languages (i.e., Python and Java). We apply HonestCoder to four popular LLMs (e.g., DeepSeek-Coder and Code Llama) and evaluate it on TruthCodeBench. Based on the experiments, we obtain the following insights. (1) HonestCoder can effectively estimate LLMs' confidence and accurately determine the correctness of generated programs. For example, HonestCoder outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline by 27.79% in AUROC and 63.74% in AUCPR. (2) HonestCoder can decrease the number of erroneous programs shown to developers. Compared to eight baselines, it can show more correct programs and fewer erroneous programs to developers. (3) Compared to showing code indiscriminately, HonestCoder only adds slight time overhead (approximately 0.4 seconds per requirement). (4) We discuss future directions to facilitate the application of LLMs in software development. We hope this work can motivate broad discussions about measuring the reliability of LLMs' outputs in performing code-related tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, their synergy remains poorly understood, largely due to the lack of systematic benchmarks evaluating their integration in clinical risk prediction. In real-world healthcare, identifying features with causal influence on outcomes is crucial for actionable and trustworthy predictions. While recent work highlights LLMs' emerging causal reasoning abilities, there lacks comprehensive benchmarks to assess their causal learning and performance informed by causal features in clinical risk prediction. To address this, we introduce REACT-LLM, a benchmark designed to evaluate whether combining LLMs with causal features can enhance clinical prognostic performance and potentially outperform traditional machine learning (ML) methods. Unlike existing LLM-clinical benchmarks that often focus on a limited set of outcomes, REACT-LLM evaluates 7 clinical outcomes across 2 real-world datasets, comparing 15 prominent LLMs, 6 traditional ML models, and 3 causal discovery (CD) algorithms. Our findings indicate that while LLMs perform reasonably in clinical prognostics, they have not yet outperformed traditional ML models. Integrating causal features derived from CD algorithms into LLMs offers limited performance gains, primarily due to the strict assumptions of many CD methods, which are often violated in complex clinical data. While the direct integration yields limited improvement, our benchmark reveals a more promising synergy.</p></details> |  |

Graphs are integral to a wide range of applications, including motion planning for autonomous vehicles, social networks, scene understanding, and knowledge graphs. Many problems, even those not initially perceived as graph-based, can be effectively addressed through graph theory. However, when applied to these tasks, LLMs often encounter challenges, such as hallucinations and mathematical inaccuracies. To overcome these limitations, we propose Graph-Grounded LLMs, a system that improves LLM performance on graph-related tasks by integrating a graph library through function calls. By grounding LLMs in this manner, we demonstrate significant reductions in hallucinations and improved mathematical accuracy in solving graph-based problems, as evidenced by the performance on the NLGraph benchmark. Finally, we showcase a disaster rescue application where the Graph-Grounded LLM acts as a decision-support system.</p></details> |  |

To-date, however, there has been little understanding of LLMs' uptake in HCI. We address this gap via a systematic literature review of 153 CHI papers from 2020-24 that engage with LLMs. We taxonomize: (1) domains where LLMs are applied; (2) roles of LLMs in HCI projects; (3) contribution types; and (4) acknowledged limitations and risks. We find LLM work in 10 diverse domains, primarily via empirical and artifact contributions. Authors use LLMs in five distinct roles, including as research tools or simulated users. Still, authors often raise validity and reproducibility concerns, and overwhelmingly study closed models. We outline opportunities to improve HCI research with and on LLMs, and provide guiding questions for researchers to consider the validity and appropriateness of LLM-related work.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is a preprint version of the paper conditionally accepted to CHI'25</p></details> |
| **[LLM-Assisted Relevance Assessments: When Should We Ask LLMs for Help?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.06877v4)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Test collections are information-retrieval tools that allow researchers to quickly and easily evaluate ranking algorithms. While test collections have become an integral part of IR research, the process of data creation involves significant manual-annotation effort, which often makes it very expensive and time-consuming. Consequently, test collections can become too small when the budget is limited, which may lead to unstable evaluations. As a cheaper alternative, recent studies have proposed using large language models (LLMs) to completely replace human assessors. However, while LLMs correlate to some extent with human judgments, their predictions are not perfect and often show bias. Thus, a complete replacement with LLMs is considered too risky and not fully reliable. In this paper, we propose LLM-Assisted Relevance Assessments (LARA), an effective method to balance manual annotations with LLM annotations, helping build a rich and reliable test collection even under a low budget. We use the LLM's predicted relevance probabilities to select the most profitable documents for manual annotation under a budget constraint. Guided by theoretical reasoning, LARA actively learns to calibrate the LLM's predicted relevance probabilities, directing the human-annotation process. Then, using the calibration model learned from the limited manual annotations, LARA debiases the LLM predictions to annotate the remaining non-assessed data. Experiments on TREC-7 Ad Hoc, TREC-8 Ad Hoc, TREC Robust 2004, and TREC-COVID datasets show that LARA outperforms alternative solutions under almost any budget constraint. While the community debates humans versus LLMs in relevance assessments, we contend that, given the same amount of human effort, it is reasonable to leverage LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages.

The most widely used integration paradigm projects the audio encoder output tokens into the LLM input space (e.g., via an MLP or a Q-Former), then prepends or inserts them to the text tokens. We refer to this generic scheme as Prepend to the LLM's input token space (PLITS) integration. We propose an efficient alternative, Lightweight Audio LLM Integration (LAL). LAL introduces audio representations solely via the attention mechanism within different layers of the LLM, bypassing its feedforward module. LAL encodes rich audio semantics at an appropriate level of abstraction for integration into different blocks of LLMs. Our design significantly reduces computational overhead compared to existing integration approaches. Observing with Whisper that the speech encoder benefits from PLITS integration, we propose an audio encoder aware approach for efficiently Probing Audio encoders via LLM (PAL), which employs PLITS integration for Whisper and LAL for general audio encoders. Under an identical training curriculum, LAL consistently maintains performance or outperforms existing integration approaches across multiple base LLMs and tasks. For general audio tasks, LAL improvement is up to 30% over a strong PLITS baseline while reducing memory usage by up to 64.1% and increasing throughput by up to 247.5%. Furthermore, for general audio-music-speech LLM, PAL performs on par with a fully PLITS integration-based system but with substantially improved computational and memory efficiency.

However, generating the code which is deeply hardware-specific, architecture-aware, and performance-critical, especially for massively parallel GPUs, remains a complex challenge. In this work, we explore the use of LLMs for the automated generation and optimization of CUDA programs, with the goal of producing high-performance GPU kernels that fully exploit the underlying hardware. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework called \textbf{Feature Search and Reinforcement (FSR)}. FSR jointly optimizes compilation and functional correctness, as well as the runtime performance, which are validated through extensive and diverse test cases, and measured by actual kernel execution latency on the target GPU, respectively. This approach enables LLMs not only to generate syntactically and semantically correct CUDA code but also to iteratively refine it for efficiency, tailored to the characteristics of the GPU architecture. We evaluate FSR on representative CUDA kernels, covering AI workloads and computational intensive algorithms. Our results show that LLMs augmented with FSR consistently guarantee correctness rates. Meanwhile, the automatically generated kernels can outperform general human-written code by a factor of up to 179$\times$ in execution speeds. These findings highlight the potential of combining LLMs with performance reinforcement to automate GPU programming for hardware-specific, architecture-sensitive, and performance-critical applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Gauging Overprecision in LLMs: An Empirical Study](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.12098v2)** | 2025-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, overconfidence in large language models (LLMs) has garnered considerable attention due to its fundamental importance in quantifying the trustworthiness of LLM generation. However, existing approaches prompt the \textit{black box LLMs} to produce their confidence (\textit{verbalized confidence}), which can be subject to many biases and hallucinations. Inspired by a different aspect of overconfidence in cognitive science called \textit{overprecision}, we designed a framework for its study in black box LLMs. This framework contains three main phases: 1) generation, 2) refinement and 3) evaluation. In the generation phase we prompt the LLM to generate answers to numerical questions in the form of intervals with a certain level of confidence. This confidence level is imposed in the prompt and not required for the LLM to generate as in previous approaches. We use various prompting techniques and use the same prompt multiple times to gauge the effects of randomness in the generation process. In the refinement phase, answers from the previous phase are refined to generate better answers. The LLM answers are evaluated and studied in the evaluation phase to understand its internal workings. This study allowed us to gain various insights into LLM overprecision: 1) LLMs are highly uncalibrated for numerical tasks 2) there is no correlation between the length of the interval and the imposed confidence level, which can be symptomatic of a a) lack of understanding of the concept of confidence or b) inability to adjust self-confidence by following instructions, {3) LLM numerical precision differs depending on the task, scale of answer and prompting technique 4) Refinement of answers doesn't improve precision in most cases. We believe this study offers new perspectives on LLM overconfidence and serves as a strong baseline for overprecision in LLMs.</p></details> | 16 pages |

While these methods can work within the distributions tested, they are neither robust nor predictable. This limitation can be addressed through compound LLM architectures where LLMs work in conjunction with other components to ensure reliability. In this paper, we present a technical evaluation of a compound LLM architecture--the LLM-Modulo framework. In this framework, an LLM is paired with a complete set of sound verifiers that validate its output, re-prompting it if it fails. This approach ensures that the system can never output any fallacious output, and therefore that every output generated is guaranteed correct--something previous techniques have not been able to claim. Our results, evaluated across four scheduling domains, demonstrate significant performance gains with the LLM-Modulo framework using various models. Additionally, we explore modifications to the base configuration of the framework and assess their impact on overall system performance.</p></details> |  |

However, deploying these models introduces critical risks related to intellectual property violations and potential misuse, particularly as adversaries can imitate these models to steal services or generate misleading outputs. We specifically focus on model stealing attacks, as they are highly relevant to proprietary LLMs and pose a serious threat to their security, revenue, and ethical deployment. While various watermarking techniques have emerged to mitigate these risks, it remains unclear how far the community and industry have progressed in developing and deploying watermarks in LLMs. To bridge this gap, we aim to develop a comprehensive systematization for watermarks in LLMs by 1) presenting a detailed taxonomy for watermarks in LLMs, 2) proposing a novel intellectual property classifier to explore the effectiveness and impacts of watermarks on LLMs under both attack and attack-free environments, 3) analyzing the limitations of existing watermarks in LLMs, and 4) discussing practical challenges and potential future directions for watermarks in LLMs. Through extensive experiments, we show that despite promising research outcomes and significant attention from leading companies and community to deploy watermarks, these techniques have yet to reach their full potential in real-world applications due to their unfavorable impacts on model utility of LLMs and downstream tasks. Our findings provide an insightful understanding of watermarks in LLMs, highlighting the need for practical watermarks solutions tailored to LLM deployment.</p></details> |  |

Aligning LLM-Assisted Evaluation of LLM Outputs with Human Preferences](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.12272v1)** | 2024-04-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the cumbersome nature of human evaluation and limitations of code-based evaluation, Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being used to assist humans in evaluating LLM outputs. Yet LLM-generated evaluators simply inherit all the problems of the LLMs they evaluate, requiring further human validation. We present a mixed-initiative approach to ``validate the validators'' -- aligning LLM-generated evaluation functions (be it prompts or code) with human requirements. Our interface, EvalGen, provides automated assistance to users in generating evaluation criteria and implementing assertions. While generating candidate implementations (Python functions, LLM grader prompts), EvalGen asks humans to grade a subset of LLM outputs; this feedback is used to select implementations that better align with user grades. A qualitative study finds overall support for EvalGen but underscores the subjectivity and iterative process of alignment. In particular, we identify a phenomenon we dub \emph{criteria drift}: users need criteria to grade outputs, but grading outputs helps users define criteria. What is more, some criteria appears \emph{dependent} on the specific LLM outputs observed (rather than independent criteria that can be defined \emph{a priori}), raising serious questions for approaches that assume the independence of evaluation from observation of model outputs. We present our interface and implementation details, a comparison of our algorithm with a baseline approach, and implications for the design of future LLM evaluation assistants.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Tag-LLM: Repurposing General-Purpose LLMs for Specialized Domains](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.05140v3)** | 2024-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in understanding and generating natural language. However, their capabilities wane in highly specialized domains underrepresented in the pretraining corpus, such as physical and biomedical sciences. This work explores how to repurpose general LLMs into effective task solvers for specialized domains. We introduce a novel, model-agnostic framework for learning custom input tags, which are parameterized as continuous vectors appended to the LLM's embedding layer, to condition the LLM. We design two types of input tags: domain tags are used to delimit specialized representations (e.g., chemical formulas) and provide domain-relevant context; function tags are used to represent specific functions (e.g., predicting molecular properties) and compress function-solving instructions. We develop a three-stage protocol to learn these tags using auxiliary data and domain knowledge. By explicitly disentangling task domains from task functions, our method enables zero-shot generalization to unseen problems through diverse combinations of the input tags. It also boosts LLM's performance in various specialized domains, such as predicting protein or chemical properties and modeling drug-target interactions, outperforming expert models tailored to these tasks.</p></details> | ICML 2024 |
| **[LLM-REVal: Can We Trust LLM Reviewers Yet?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.12367v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has inspired researchers to integrate them extensively into the academic workflow, potentially reshaping how research is practiced and reviewed. While previous studies highlight the potential of LLMs in supporting research and peer review, their dual roles in the academic workflow and the complex interplay between research and review bring new risks that remain largely underexplored. In this study, we focus on how the deep integration of LLMs into both peer-review and research processes may influence scholarly fairness, examining the potential risks of using LLMs as reviewers by simulation. This simulation incorporates a research agent, which generates papers and revises, alongside a review agent, which assesses the submissions. Based on the simulation results, we conduct human annotations and identify pronounced misalignment between LLM-based reviews and human judgments: (1) LLM reviewers systematically inflate scores for LLM-authored papers, assigning them markedly higher scores than human-authored ones; (2) LLM reviewers persistently underrate human-authored papers with critical statements (e.g., risk, fairness), even after multiple revisions. Our analysis reveals that these stem from two primary biases in LLM reviewers: a linguistic feature bias favoring LLM-generated writing styles, and an aversion toward critical statements. These results highlight the risks and equity concerns posed to human authors and academic research if LLMs are deployed in the peer review cycle without adequate caution. On the other hand, revisions guided by LLM reviews yield quality gains in both LLM-based and human evaluations, illustrating the potential of the LLMs-as-reviewers for early-stage researchers and enhancing low-quality papers.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we study this issue from a venture capital perspective by predicting idea-stage startup success based on founder traits. (i) To build a reliable prediction model, we introduce LLM-AR, a pipeline inspired by neural-symbolic systems that distils LLM-generated heuristics into probabilistic rules executed by the ProbLog automated-reasoning engine. (ii) An iterative policy-evolution loop incorporates association-rule mining to progressively refine the prediction rules. On unseen folds, LLM-AR achieves 59.5% precision and 8.7% recall, 5.9x the random baseline precision, while exposing every decision path for human inspection. The framework is interpretable and tunable via hyperparameters, showing promise to extend into other domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-FE: Automated Feature Engineering for Tabular Data with LLMs as Evolutionary Optimizers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.14434v2)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated feature engineering plays a critical role in improving predictive model performance for tabular learning tasks. Traditional automated feature engineering methods are limited by their reliance on pre-defined transformations within fixed, manually designed search spaces, often neglecting domain knowledge. Recent advances using Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled the integration of domain knowledge into the feature engineering process. However, existing LLM-based approaches use direct prompting or rely solely on validation scores for feature selection, failing to leverage insights from prior feature discovery experiments or establish meaningful reasoning between feature generation and data-driven performance. To address these challenges, we propose LLM-FE, a novel framework that combines evolutionary search with the domain knowledge and reasoning capabilities of LLMs to automatically discover effective features for tabular learning tasks. LLM-FE formulates feature engineering as a program search problem, where LLMs propose new feature transformation programs iteratively, and data-driven feedback guides the search process. Our results demonstrate that LLM-FE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, significantly enhancing the performance of tabular prediction models across diverse classification and regression benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

| **[Asynchronous LLM Function Calling](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.07017v1)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) use function calls to interface with external tools and data source. However, the current approach to LLM function calling is inherently synchronous, where each call blocks LLM inference, limiting LLM operation and concurrent function execution. In this work, we propose AsyncLM, a system for asynchronous LLM function calling. AsyncLM improves LLM's operational efficiency by enabling LLMs to generate and execute function calls concurrently. Instead of waiting for each call's completion, AsyncLM introduces an interrupt mechanism to asynchronously notify the LLM in-flight when function calls return. We design an in-context protocol for function calls and interrupts, provide fine-tuning strategy to adapt LLMs to the interrupt semantics, and implement these mechanisms efficiently on LLM inference process. We demonstrate that AsyncLM can reduce end-to-end task completion latency from 1.6x-5.4x compared to synchronous function calling on a set of benchmark tasks in the Berkeley function calling leaderboard (BFCL). Furthermore, we discuss how interrupt mechanisms can be extended to enable novel human-LLM or LLM-LLM interactions.</p></details> |  |
| **[An LLM Compiler for Parallel Function Calling](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.04511v3)** | 2024-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The reasoning capabilities of the recent LLMs enable them to execute external function calls to overcome their inherent limitations, such as knowledge cutoffs, poor arithmetic skills, or lack of access to private data. This development has allowed LLMs to select and coordinate multiple functions based on the context to tackle more complex problems. However, current methods for function calling often require sequential reasoning and acting for each function which can result in high latency, cost, and sometimes inaccurate behavior. To address this, we introduce LLMCompiler, which executes functions in parallel to efficiently orchestrate multiple function calls. Drawing inspiration from the principles of classical compilers, LLMCompiler enables parallel function calling with three components: (i) a Function Calling Planner, formulating execution plans for function calling; (ii) a Task Fetching Unit, dispatching function calling tasks; and (iii) an Executor, executing these tasks in parallel. LLMCompiler automatically generates an optimized orchestration for the function calls and can be used with both open-source and closed-source models. We have benchmarked LLMCompiler on a range of tasks with different patterns of function calling. We observe consistent latency speedup of up to 3.7x, cost savings of up to 6.7x, and accuracy improvement of up to ~9% compared to ReAct. Our code is available at https://github.com/SqueezeAILab/LLMCompiler.</p></details> | ICML 2024 |

While prior research has primarily focused on improving FC accuracy, little attention has been given to the robustness of these agents to perturbations in their input. We introduce a benchmark assessing FC robustness in two key areas: resilience to naturalistic query variations, and stability in function calling when the toolkit expands with semantically related tools. Evaluating best-performing FC models on a carefully expanded subset of the Berkeley function calling leaderboard (BFCL), we identify critical weaknesses in existing evaluation methodologies, and highlight areas for improvement in real-world agentic deployments.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, TrustNLP@NAACL25</p></details> |
| **[TinyAgent: Function Calling at the Edge](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.00608v3)** | 2024-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent large language models (LLMs) have enabled the development of advanced agentic systems that can integrate various tools and APIs to fulfill user queries through function calling. However, the deployment of these LLMs on the edge has not been explored since they typically require cloud-based infrastructure due to their substantial model size and computational demands. To this end, we present TinyAgent, an end-to-end framework for training and deploying task-specific small language model agents capable of function calling for driving agentic systems at the edge. We first show how to enable accurate function calling for open-source models via the LLMCompiler framework. We then systematically curate a high-quality dataset for function calling, which we use to fine-tune two small language models, TinyAgent-1.1B and 7B. For efficient inference, we introduce a novel tool retrieval method to reduce the input prompt length and utilize quantization to further accelerate the inference speed. As a driving application, we demonstrate a local Siri-like system for Apple's MacBook that can execute user commands through text or voice input. Our results show that our models can achieve, and even surpass, the function-calling capabilities of larger models like GPT-4-Turbo, while being fully deployed at the edge. We open-source our dataset, models, and installable package and provide a demo video for our MacBook assistant agent.</p></details> | EMNLP 2024 Demo |
| **[Granite-Function Calling Model: Introducing Function Calling Abilities via Multi-task Learning of Granular Tasks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.00121v1)** | 2024-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have recently shown tremendous promise in serving as the backbone to agentic systems, as demonstrated by their performance in multi-faceted, challenging benchmarks like SWE-Bench and Agent-Bench. However, to realize the true potential of LLMs as autonomous agents, they must learn to identify, call, and interact with external tools and application program interfaces (APIs) to complete complex tasks. These tasks together are termed function calling. Endowing LLMs with function calling abilities leads to a myriad of advantages, such as access to current and domain-specific information in databases and knowledge sources, and the ability to outsource tasks that can be reliably performed by tools, e.g., a Python interpreter or calculator. While there has been significant progress in function calling with LLMs, there is still a dearth of open models that perform on par with proprietary LLMs like GPT, Claude, and Gemini. Therefore, in this work, we introduce the GRANITE-20B-FUNCTIONCALLING model under an Apache 2.0 license. The model is trained using a multi-task training approach on seven fundamental tasks encompassed in function calling, those being Nested Function Calling, Function Chaining, Parallel Functions, Function Name Detection, Parameter-Value Pair Detection, Next-Best Function, and Response Generation. We present a comprehensive evaluation on multiple out-of-domain datasets comparing GRANITE-20B-FUNCTIONCALLING to more than 15 other best proprietary and open models. GRANITE-20B-FUNCTIONCALLING provides the best performance among all open models on the Berkeley Function Calling Leaderboard and fourth overall. As a result of the diverse tasks and datasets used for training our model, we show that GRANITE-20B-FUNCTIONCALLING has better generalizability on multiple tasks in seven different evaluation datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Querying Databases with Function Calling](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.00032v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly accelerating largely thanks to their integration with external tools. Querying databases is among the most effective of these integrations, enabling LLMs to access private or continually updating data. While Function Calling is the most common method for interfacing external tools to LLMs, its application to database querying as a tool has been underexplored. We propose a tool definition for database querying that unifies accessing data with search queries, filters, or a combination both, as well as transforming results with aggregation and groupby operators. To evaluate its effectiveness, we conduct a study with 8 LLMs spanning 5 model families. We present a novel pipeline adapting the Gorilla LLM framework to create synthetic database schemas and queries. We primarily evaluate the models with the Exact Match of predicted and ground truth query APIs. Among the models tested, Claude 3.5 Sonnet achieves the highest performance with an Exact Match score of 74.3%, followed by GPT-4o mini at 73.7%, and GPT-4o at 71.8%. We further breakdown these results per API component utilized and across synthetic use cases. We find that LLMs are highly effective at utilizing operators on boolean properties, but struggle with text property filters. Across use cases we find robust results with the higher performing models such as GPT-4o, but significant performance variance across use cases from lower performing models. We additionally conduct ablation studies exploring the impact of parallel tool calling, adding a rationale as an argument of the tool call, using a separate tool per database collection, and tool calling with structured outputs. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of enabling LLMs to query databases with Function Calling. We have open-sourced our experimental code and results at github.com/weaviate/gorilla.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint. 23 pages, 7 figures</p></details> |

It allows for inter-contract and inter-blockchain function calls that are both synchronous and atomic: if one part fails, the whole call graph of function calls is rolled back. Existing atomic cross-blockchain function call protocols are Blockchain Layer 1 protocols, which require changes to the blockchain platform software to operate. Blockchain Layer 2 technologies such as the one described in this paper require no such changes. They operate on top of the infrastructure provided by the blockchain platform software. This paper introduces the protocol and a more scalable variant, provides an initial safety and liveness analysis, and presents the expected overhead of using this technology when compared to using multiple non-atomic single blockchain transactions. The overhead is analysed for three scenarios involving multiple blockchains: the Hotel and Train problem, Supply Chain with Provenance, and an Oracle. The protocol is shown to provide 93.8 or 186 cross-blockchain function calls per second for the Hotel and Train scenario when there are many travel agencies, for the standard and scalable variant of the protocol respectively, given the Ethereum client, Hyperledger Besu's performance of 375 tps, assuming a block period of one second, and assuming all transactions take the same amount of time to execute as the benchmark transactions.</p></details> | 12 pages, 12 figures |
| **[Hammer: Robust Function-Calling for On-Device Language Models via Function Masking](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.04587v2)** | 2024-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models have demonstrated impressive value in performing as autonomous agents when equipped with external tools and API calls. Nonetheless, effectively harnessing their potential for executing complex tasks crucially relies on enhancements in their function calling capabilities. This paper identifies a critical gap in existing function calling models, where performance varies significantly across benchmarks, often due to being misled by specific naming conventions. To address such an issue, we introduce Hammer, a novel family of foundation models specifically engineered for on-device function calling. Hammer employs an augmented dataset that enhances models' sensitivity to irrelevant functions and incorporates function masking techniques to minimize misleading. Our empirical evaluations reveal that Hammer not only outperforms larger models but also demonstrates robust generalization across diverse benchmarks, achieving sota results. Our open source contributions include a specialized dataset for irrelevance detection, a tuning framework for enhanced generalization, and the Hammer models, establishing a new standard for function calling performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[In-The-Field Monitoring of Functional Calls: Is It Feasible?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.07283v1)** | 2020-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Collecting data about the sequences of function calls executed by an application while running in the field can be useful to a number of applications, including failure reproduction, profiling, and debugging. Unfortunately, collecting data from the field may introduce annoying slowdowns that negatively affect the quality of the user experience. So far, the impact of monitoring has been mainly studied in terms of the overhead that it may introduce in the monitored applications, rather than considering if the introduced overhead can be really recognized by users. In this paper we take a different perspective studying to what extent collecting data about sequences of function calls may impact the quality of the user experience, producing recognizable effects. Interestingly we found that, depending on the nature of the executed operation and its execution context, users may tolerate a non-trivial overhead. This information can be potentially exploited to collect significant amount of data without annoying users.</p></details> |  |
| **[ToolACE: Winning the Points of LLM Function Calling](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.00920v2)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Function calling significantly extends the application boundary of large language models, where high-quality and diverse training data is critical for unlocking this capability. However, real function-calling data is quite challenging to collect and annotate, while synthetic data generated by existing pipelines tends to lack coverage and accuracy. In this paper, we present ToolACE, an automatic agentic pipeline designed to generate accurate, complex, and diverse tool-learning data. ToolACE leverages a novel self-evolution synthesis process to curate a comprehensive API pool of 26,507 diverse APIs. Dialogs are further generated through the interplay among multiple agents, guided by a formalized thinking process. To ensure data accuracy, we implement a dual-layer verification system combining rule-based and model-based checks. We demonstrate that models trained on our synthesized data, even with only 8B parameters, achieve state-of-the-art performance on the Berkeley Function-Calling Leaderboard, rivaling the latest GPT-4 models. Our model and a subset of the data are publicly available at https://huggingface.co/Team-ACE.</p></details> | 21 pages, 22 figures |

However, challenges such as data scarcity, ineffective question formatting, and catastrophic forgetting hinder the development of on-device LLM agents. To tackle these issues, we propose Alopex, a framework that enables precise on-device function calls using the Fox LLM. Alopex introduces a logic-based method for generating high-quality training data and a novel ``description-question-output'' format for fine-tuning, reducing risks of function information leakage. Additionally, a data mixing strategy is used to mitigate catastrophic forgetting, combining function call data with textbook datasets to enhance performance in various tasks. Experimental results show that Alopex improves function call accuracy and significantly reduces catastrophic forgetting, providing a robust solution for integrating function call capabilities into LLMs without manual intervention.</p></details> |  |

| **[An LLM-Tool Compiler for Fused Parallel Function Calling](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.17438v1)** | 2024-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State-of-the-art sequential reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) has expanded the capabilities of Copilots beyond conversational tasks to complex function calling, managing thousands of API calls. However, the tendency of compositional prompting to segment tasks into multiple steps, each requiring a round-trip to the GPT APIs, leads to increased system latency and costs. Although recent advancements in parallel function calling have improved tool execution per API call, they may necessitate more detailed in-context instructions and task breakdown at the prompt level, resulting in higher engineering and production costs. Inspired by the hardware design principles of multiply-add (MAD) operations, which fuse multiple arithmetic operations into a single task from the compiler's perspective, we propose LLM-Tool Compiler, which selectively fuses similar types of tool operations under a single function at runtime, presenting them as a unified task to the LLM. This selective fusion inherently enhances parallelization and efficiency. Benchmarked on a large-scale Copilot platform, LLM-Tool Compiler achieves up to four times more parallel calls than existing methods, reducing token costs and latency by up to 40% and 12%, respectively.</p></details> |  |

Meanwhile, inference scaling has become a cutting-edge technique to enhance LLM performance by allocating more computational resources during the inference process. However, current research on inference scaling primarily focuses on unstructured output generation tasks, leaving its application in structured outputs, like function calling, largely underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose an inference scaling framework that combines fine-grained beam search with a process reward model, ToolPRM, which scores the internal steps of each single function call. To train ToolPRM, we construct the first fine-grained intra-call process supervision dataset, automatically annotated with function-masking techniques to provide step-level rewards for structured tool-use reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ToolPRM beats the coarse-grained and outcome reward models in terms of predictive accuracy, indicating its stronger capability in supervising the function calling inference process. Inference scaling technique equipped with ToolPRM also significantly improves the backbone model performance across various function calling tasks and benchmarks. More importantly, we reveal a key principle for applying inference scaling techniques to structured outputs: "explore more but retain less" due to the unrecoverability characteristics of structured function calling generation.</p></details> |  |

Though prior work on static call graph analysis exists, very little involves the application of modern, principled feature learning techniques to the problem. In this paper, we introduce a system utilizing an executable's function call graph where function representations are obtained by way of a recurrent neural network (RNN) autoencoder which maps sequences of x86 instructions into dense, latent vectors. These function embeddings are then modeled as vertices in a graph with edges indicating call dependencies. Capturing rich, node-level representations as well as global, topological properties of an executable file greatly improves malware family detection rates and contributes to a more principled approach to the problem in a way that deliberately avoids tedious feature engineering and domain expertise. We test our approach by performing several experiments on a Microsoft malware classification data set and achieve excellent separation between malware families with a classification accuracy of 99.41%.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 6 figures, accepted to CSoNet 2020 Dallas, to be published in Springer's Lecture Notes in Computer Science</p></details> |

However, managing large amounts of data and interacting with numerous APIs makes function calling hardware-intensive and costly, especially on edge devices. Current Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with function calling at the edge because they cannot handle complex inputs or manage multiple tools effectively. This results in low task-completion accuracy, increased delays, and higher power consumption. In this work, we introduce Less-is-More, a novel fine-tuning-free function-calling scheme for dynamic tool selection. Our approach is based on the key insight that selectively reducing the number of tools available to LLMs significantly improves their function-calling performance, execution time, and power efficiency on edge devices. Experimental results with state-of-the-art LLMs on edge hardware show agentic success rate improvements, with execution time reduced by up to 70% and power consumption by up to 40%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at DATE 2025</p></details> |

In contrast to conventional methods that rely on pre-scheduled action sequences or behavior trees, GhostShell drives embodied systems to act on-the-fly by issuing function calls incrementally as tokens are streamed from the LLM. GhostShell features a streaming XML function token parser, a dynamic function interface mapper, and a multi-channel scheduler that orchestrates intra-channel synchronous and inter-channel asynchronous function calls, thereby coordinating serial-parallel embodied actions across multiple robotic components under LLM guidance. We evaluate GhostShell on our robotic prototype COCO through comprehensive grounded experiments across 34 real-world interaction tasks and multiple LLM backends. The results demonstrate that our approach achieves a state-of-the-art Behavioral Correctness Metric of 0.85 with Claude-4-Sonnet, and up to 66X faster response times compared to native LLM function calling APIs. GhostShell also proves effective in long-horizon multimodal tasks, exhibiting strong robustness and generalization capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 5 figures, conference</p></details> |

The most common definition is that of partial equivalence, namely that the two functions emit the same output if they are fed with the same input and they both terminate. The strategy used by the Regression Verification Tool (RVT) is to progress bottom up on the call graphs of $P_1,P_2$, abstract those functions that were already proven to be equivalent with uninterpreted functions, turn loops into recursion, and abstract the recursive calls also with uninterpreted functions. This enables it to create verification conditions in the form of small programs that are loop- and recursion-free. This method works well for recursive functions as long as they are in sync, and typically fails otherwise. In this work we study the problem of proving equivalence when the two recursive functions are not in sync. Effectively we extend previous work that studied this problem for functions with a single recursive call site, to the general case. We also introduce a method for detecting automatically the unrolling that is necessary for making two recursive functions synchronize, when possible. We show examples of pairs of functions with multiple recursive calls that can now be proven equivalent with our method, but cannot be proven equivalent with any other automated verification system.</p></details> | <details><summary>long ...</summary><p>long version of a submission to VSTTE'22</p></details> |

However, the high latency associated with LLM-based Function Calling significantly impacts user experience. This paper presents a novel approach called Oriented Distillation for Inline Acceleration (ODIA) that leverages online user interaction data to accelerate Function Calling. By automatically identifying "simple queries" from production traffic and distilling knowledge from larger models to smaller ones, our method reduces response latency by 45% (expected) and 78% (median) while maintaining accuracy. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through real-world deployment in a music application, where the smaller model successfully handles 60% of traffic with negligible accuracy loss. Our method requires minimal human intervention and continuously improves through automated data collection and model updating, making it a practical solution for production environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Instruction-Following Evaluation in Function Calling for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.18420v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Function calling is a core capability of large language models, essential for AI agents. Existing benchmarks such as the Berkeley Function Calling Leaderboard (BFCL), tau^2-Bench (arXiv:2506.07982), and ACEBench (arXiv:2501.12851) evaluate argument correctness but do not test adherence to format instructions embedded in parameter descriptions, such as enclosing values in double quotes or using ISO date formats. We introduce IFEval-FC, a benchmark inspired by IFEval (arXiv:2311.07911) that assesses precise instruction following in function calling. IFEval-FC encodes verifiable formats directly within JSON schema descriptions, for example specifying that a value must not contain punctuation. It includes 750 test cases, each consisting of a function with an embedded format for one of its input parameters and a corresponding user query. Evaluation is fully algorithmic, ensuring objectivity, reproducibility, and scalability. Our results show that even state-of-the-art proprietary models, including GPT-5 and Claude 4.1 Opus, frequently fail to follow basic formatting rules, highlighting a practical limitation for real-world agent systems.

Current benchmarks lack comprehensive assessment of LLMs in complex conversational scenarios. CONFETTI addresses this gap through 109 human-simulated conversations, comprising 313 user turns and covering 86 APIs. These conversations explicitly target various conversational complexities, such as follow-ups, goal correction and switching, ambiguous and implicit goals. We perform off-policy turn-level evaluation using this benchmark targeting function-calling. Our benchmark also incorporates dialog act annotations to assess agent responses. We evaluate a series of state-of-the-art LLMs and analyze their performance with respect to the number of available APIs, conversation lengths, and chained function calling. Our results reveal that while some models are able to handle long conversations, and leverage more than 20+ APIs successfully, other models struggle with longer context or when increasing the number of APIs. We also report that the performance on chained function-calls is severely limited across the models. Overall, the top performing models on CONFETTI are Nova Pro (40.01%), Claude Sonnet v3.5 (35.46%) and Llama 3.1 405B (33.19%) followed by command-r-plus (31.18%) and Mistral-Large-2407 (30.07%).</p></details> | <details><summary>ACL 2...</summary><p>ACL 2025 (main conference)</p></details> |

While extensive research has been conducted on the safety of LLMs in chat mode, the security implications of their function calling feature have been largely overlooked. This paper uncovers a critical vulnerability in the function calling process of LLMs, introducing a novel "jailbreak function" attack method that exploits alignment discrepancies, user coercion, and the absence of rigorous safety filters. Our empirical study, conducted on six state-of-the-art LLMs including GPT-4o, Claude-3.5-Sonnet, and Gemini-1.5-pro, reveals an alarming average success rate of over 90\% for this attack. We provide a comprehensive analysis of why function calls are susceptible to such attacks and propose defensive strategies, including the use of defensive prompts. Our findings highlight the urgent need for enhanced security measures in the function calling capabilities of LLMs, contributing to the field of AI safety by identifying a previously unexplored risk, designing an effective attack method, and suggesting practical defensive measures.

| **[Learning Joint Embeddings of Function and Process Call Graphs for Malware Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.09984v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software systems can be represented as graphs, capturing dependencies among functions and processes. An interesting aspect of software systems is that they can be represented as different types of graphs, depending on the extraction goals and priorities. For example, function calls within the software can be captured to create function call graphs, which highlight the relationships between functions and their dependencies. Alternatively, the processes spawned by the software can be modeled to generate process interaction graphs, which focus on runtime behavior and inter-process communication. While these graph representations are related, each captures a distinct perspective of the system, providing complementary insights into its structure and operation. While previous studies have leveraged graph neural networks (GNNs) to analyze software behaviors, most of this work has focused on a single type of graph representation. The joint modeling of both function call graphs and process interaction graphs remains largely underexplored, leaving opportunities for deeper, multi-perspective analysis of software systems. This paper presents a pipeline for constructing and training Function Call Graphs (FCGs) and Process Call Graphs (PCGs) and learning joint embeddings. We demonstrate that joint embeddings outperform a single-graph model. In this paper, we propose GeminiNet, a unified neural network approach that learns joint embeddings from both FCGs and PCGs. We construct a new dataset of 635 Windows executables (318 malicious and 317 benign), extracting FCGs via Ghidra and PCGs via Any.Run sandbox. GeminiNet employs dual graph convolutional branches with an adaptive gating mechanism that balances contributions from static and dynamic views.</p></details> |  |

In current FaaS platforms, both synchronous and asynchronous calls are executed immediately. In this paper, we present ProFaaStinate, which extends serverless platforms to enable delayed execution of asynchronous function calls. This allows platforms to execute calls at convenient times with higher resource availability or lower load. ProFaaStinate is able to optimize performance without requiring deep integration into the rest of the platform, or a complex systems model. In our evaluation, our prototype built on top of Nuclio can reduce request response latency and workflow duration while also preventing the system from being overloaded during load peaks. Using a document preparation use case, we show a 54% reduction in average request response latency. This reduction in resource usage benefits both platforms and users as cost savings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in Proc. of 9th International Workshop on Serverless Computing (WoSC 23)</p></details> |

However, evaluating the function calling abilities of LLMs in real-world scenarios remains under-explored due to the complexity of data collection and evaluation. In this work, we introduce ComplexFuncBench, a benchmark for complex function calling across five real-world scenarios. Compared to existing benchmarks, ComplexFuncBench encompasses multi-step and constrained function calling, which requires long-parameter filing, parameter value reasoning, and 128k long context. Additionally, we propose an automatic framework, ComplexEval, for quantitatively evaluating complex function calling tasks. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate the deficiencies of state-of-the-art LLMs in function calling and suggest future directions for optimizing these capabilities.

| **[LongFuncEval: Measuring the effectiveness of long context models for function calling](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.10570v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple recent studies have documented large language models' (LLMs) performance on calling external tools/functions. Others focused on LLMs' abilities to handle longer context lengths. At the intersection of these areas lies another interesting problem: LLMs' abilities to accurately perform function calls in long context settings. Particularly, when calling tools, LLMs are encumbered by three predominant challenges: (1) a large catalog of tools, (2) long responses from the tool APIs, and (3) long multi-turn conversations. These challenges are particularly relevant to enterprise applications of LLMs which engage in multi-turn conversations with users to complete complex tasks that require a large catalog of complex tools. The literature contains multiple investigations of long context challenges such as lost in the middle or needle in the haystack for natural language tasks. In this paper, we make the first attempt to comprehensively study the long context understanding capabilities of these models in the tool calling setup. We modify existing benchmarks for challenge 1 and 3, and create a new evaluation set for challenge 2 to enable this analysis. We gradually increase the input context length and also vary the position of the answer in the input. When evaluated with several long context models, we observe a performance drop of 7% to 85% as the number of tools increases, a 7% to 91% degradation in answer retrieval as the tool responses length increases, and 13% and 40% degradation for as multi-turn conversations get longer. Our study shows that LLMs still struggle with long context in tool calling settings, motivating future research to drive further LLM improvements.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Small-Scale Large Language Models Function Calling for Reasoning Tasks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.18890v1)** | 2024-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in natural language understanding and generation. While these models excel in general complex reasoning tasks, they still face challenges in mathematical problem-solving and logical reasoning. To address these limitations, researchers have explored function calling abilities, allowing LLMs to execute provided functions and utilize their outputs for task completion. However, concentrating on specific tasks can be very inefficient for large-scale LLMs to be used, because of the expensive cost of training and inference stages they need in terms of computational resources. This study introduces a novel framework for training smaller language models in function calling, focusing on specific logical and mathematical reasoning tasks. The approach aims to improve performances of small-scale models for these tasks using function calling, ensuring a high level of accuracy. Our framework employs an agent that, given a problem and a set of callable functions, queries the LLM by injecting a description and examples of the usable functions into the prompt and managing their calls in a step-by-step reasoning chain. This process is used to create a dataset of correct and incorrect reasoning chain chat completions from a large-scale LLM. This dataset is used to train a smaller LLM using Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), specifically employing the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) technique. Experimental results demonstrate how the proposed approach balances the trade-off between model size and performance, improving the ability of function calling for reasoning tasks, in smaller models.</p></details> |  |

The Array Canary appears to be an advanced form of the array shuffling techniques employed by the Emotet JavaScript downloader. In practice, a series of Array Canaries are set within a string array and if modified will cause the program to endlessly loop. In this paper, we demonstrate how an Array Canary works and discuss Autonomous Function Call Resolution (AFCR), which is a method we created to bypass Array Canaries. We also introduce Arphsy, a proof-of-concept for AFCR designed to guide Large Language Models and security researchers in the deobfuscation of "canaried" JavaScript code. We accomplish this by (i) Finding and extracting all Immediately Invoked Function Expressions from a canaried file, (ii) parsing the file's Abstract Syntax Tree for any function that does not implement imported function calls, (iii) identifying the most reassigned variable and its corresponding function body, (iv) calculating the length of the largest string array and uses it to determine the offset values within the canaried file, (v) aggregating all the previously identified functions into a single file, and (vi) appending driver code into the verified file and using it to deobfuscate the canaried file.</p></details> |  |

Our key findings and contributions are as follows: (1) Instruction-following data improves both function-calling accuracy and relevance detection. (2) The use of the newly proposed Decision Token, combined with synthetic non-function-call data, enhances relevance detection. (3) A tailored translation pipeline effectively overcomes multilingual limitations, demonstrating significant improvements in Traditional Chinese.

While current research on function calling by LLMs primarily focuses on single-turn interactions, this paper addresses the overlooked necessity for LLMs to engage in multi-turn function calling--critical for handling compositional, real-world queries that require planning with functions but not only use functions. To facilitate this, we introduce an approach, BUTTON, which generates synthetic compositional instruction tuning data via bottom-up instruction construction and top-down trajectory generation. In the bottom-up phase, we generate simple atomic tasks based on real-world scenarios and build compositional tasks using heuristic strategies based on atomic tasks. Corresponding function definitions are then synthesized for these compositional tasks. The top-down phase features a multi-agent environment where interactions among simulated humans, assistants, and tools are utilized to gather multi-turn function calling trajectories. This approach ensures task compositionality and allows for effective function and trajectory generation by examining atomic tasks within compositional tasks. We produce a dataset BUTTONInstruct comprising 8k data points and demonstrate its effectiveness through extensive experiments across various LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025</p></details> |

By leveraging these APIs as functional tools, enterprises can design diverse, scenario-specific agent applications, driven by on-premise function-calling models as the core engine. However, generic models often fail to meet enterprise requirements in terms of computational efficiency, output accuracy, and stability, necessitating scenario-specific adaptation. In this paper, we propose a training pipeline for function-calling capabilities tailored to real-world business scenarios. This pipeline includes the synthesis and augmentation of scenario-specific function-calling data, model fine-tuning, and performance evaluation and analysis. Using this pipeline, we generated 1,260 fully AI-generated samples and 1,035 augmented manually-labeled samples in digital HR agent scenario. The Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct model was employed as the base model and fine-tuned using the LoRA method on four GPUs with 24GB VRAM. Our fine-tuned model demonstrated outstanding performance in evaluations and practical applications, surpassing GPT-4 and GPT-4o in accuracy on the test set.

While current benchmarks have shown that LLMs can solve tasks using programs like human developers, the majority of their evaluations are limited to short and self-contained algorithmic tasks or standalone function calls. Solving challenging and practical tasks requires the capability of utilizing diverse function calls as tools to efficiently implement functionalities like data analysis and web development. In addition, using multiple tools to solve a task needs compositional reasoning by accurately understanding complex instructions. Fulfilling both of these characteristics can pose a great challenge for LLMs.To assess how well LLMs can solve challenging and practical tasks via programs, we introduce BigCodeBench, a benchmark that challenges LLMs to invoke multiple function calls as tools from 139 libraries and 7 domains for 1,140 fine-grained tasks. To evaluate LLMs rigorously, each task encompasses 5.6 test cases with an average branch coverage of 99%. In addition, we propose a natural-language-oriented variant of BigCodeBench, BigCodeBench-Instruct, that automatically transforms the original docstrings into short instructions only with essential information. Our extensive evaluation of 60 LLMs shows that LLMs are not yet capable of following complex instructions to use function calls precisely, with scores up to 60%, significantly lower than the human performance of 97%.

To tackle these challenges, this paper introduces ADC, an innovative approach that enhances LLMs' ability to follow function formats and match complex parameters. ADC utilizes a high-quality code fine-tuning dataset with line-level execution feedback, providing granular process supervision that fosters strong logical reasoning and adherence to function formats. It also employs an adversarial dataset generation process to improve parameter matching. The staged training methodology capitalizes on both enriched code datasets and refined adversarial datasets, leading to marked improvements in function calling capabilities on the Berkeley Function-Calling Leaderboard (BFCL) Benchmark.

| **[Combining Code Embedding with Static Analysis for Function-Call Completion](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.03731v2)** | 2020-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code completion is an important feature of integrated development environments (IDEs). It allows developers to produce code faster, especially novice ones who are not fully familiar with APIs and others code. Previous works on code completion have mainly exploited static type systems of programming languages or code history of the project under development or of other projects using common APIs. In this work, we present a novel approach for improving current function-calls completion tools by learning from independent code repositories, using well-known natural language processing models that can learn vector representation of source code (code embeddings). Our models are not trained on historical data of specific projects. Instead, our approach allows to learn high-level concepts and their relationships present among thousands of projects. As a consequence, the resulting system is able to provide general suggestions that are not specific to particular projects or APIs. Additionally, by taking into account the context of the call to complete, our approach suggests function calls relevant to that context. We evaluated our approach on a set of open-source projects unseen during the training. The results show that the use of the trained model along with a code suggestion plug-in based on static type analysis improves significantly the correctness of the completion suggestions.</p></details> |  |

We develop a method that automatically extracts such recurrences from the syntax of higher-order recursive functional programs. The resulting recurrences, which are programs in a call-by-name language with recursion, explicitly compute the running time in terms of the size of the input. In order to achieve this in a uniform way that covers both call-by-name and call-by-value evaluation strategies, we use Call-by-Push-Value (CBPV) as an intermediate language. Finally, we use domain theory to develop a denotational cost semantics for the resulting recurrences.</p></details> | POPL 2020 |

In these settings, LLMs must not only issue accurate function calls at each step but also maintain progress awareness, the ability to summarize past interactions and plan future actions to ensure coherent, long-horizon task execution. Existing approaches, however, either reduce multi-turn training to isolated single-turn samples, which neglects task-level planning, or employ end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL) that struggles with redundancy and lacks explicit integration of progress awareness. To overcome these limitations, we introduce PARL-MT, a framework that explicitly incorporates progress awareness into LLM training for multi-turn function calling. PARL-MT combines (i) a Progress Awareness Generation (PAG) pipeline, which automatically constructs datasets coupling conversation summaries with future task planning, and (ii) a Progress Awareness-Guided Reinforcement Learning (PAG-RL) algorithm, which integrates progress awareness into RL training to reduce contextual redundancy and improve alignment between local actions and global task completion. Empirical results on two public benchmarks demonstrate that PARL-MT significantly outperforms existing methods, highlighting the effectiveness of progress awareness in enabling robust and efficient multi-turn function calling.</p></details> |  |

For example, a query to book the shortest flight from New York to London on January 15 requires identifying the correct parameters to generate accurate function calls. Large Language Models (LLMs) can automate this process but are computationally expensive and impractical in resource-constrained settings. In contrast, Small Language Models (SLMs) can operate efficiently, offering faster response times, and lower computational demands, making them potential candidates for function calling on edge devices. In this exploratory empirical study, we evaluate the efficacy of SLMs in generating function calls across diverse domains using zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning approaches, both with and without prompt injection, while also providing the finetuned models to facilitate future applications. Furthermore, we analyze the model responses across a range of metrics, capturing various aspects of function call generation. Additionally, we perform experiments on an edge device to evaluate their performance in terms of latency and memory usage, providing useful insights into their practical applicability. Our findings show that while SLMs improve from zero-shot to few-shot and perform best with fine-tuning, they struggle significantly with adhering to the given output format. Prompt injection experiments further indicate that the models are generally robust and exhibit only a slight decline in performance. While SLMs demonstrate potential for the function call generation task, our results also highlight areas that need further refinement for real-time functioning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EASE 2025 AI Models and Data Evaluation track</p></details> |

Standard methods like Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) fail to instill robust reasoning, and traditional Reinforcement Learning (RL) struggles with inefficient exploration. We propose \textbf{EGPO}, a new RL framework built upon Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), designed to address this challenge directly. The core of EGPO is an entropy-enhanced advantage function that integrates the entropy of the model's Chain-of-Thought (CoT) into the policy gradient computation. This encourages the generation of diverse reasoning strategies. To maintain optimization direction, the entropy bonus is carefully constrained by a clipping mechanism. Complemented by a strict, binary reward signal, EGPO effectively guides the model towards discovering structured and accurate tool invocation patterns. On the challenging Berkeley Function Calling Leaderboard (BFCL), a 4B-parameter model trained with EGPO sets a new state-of-the-art among models of comparable size, surpassing a range of strong competitors, including GPT-4o and Gemini-2.5.</p></details> |  |

CarbonCall adjusts power thresholds based on real-time carbon intensity forecasts and switches between model variants to sustain high tokens-per-second throughput under power constraints.

Our approach concentrates on refining the models' grasp of API structures and syntax, significantly enhancing the accuracy of API function calls. Additionally, we propose \textit{conditional masking} techniques to ensure outputs in the desired formats and reduce error rates while maintaining inference speeds. We also propose a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the effectiveness of LLMs in API interactions, establishing a foundation for subsequent research. Octopus, the fine-tuned model, is proved to have better performance than GPT-4 for the software APIs calling. This research aims to advance automated software development and API integration, representing substantial progress in aligning LLM capabilities with the demands of practical software engineering applications.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we address an embedding misalignment issue that often arises in practical applications due to imperfect embedding models or noisy descriptions; such misalignment may lead to incorrect retrieval and task failure. We introduce Online-Optimized RAG, a deployment-time framework that continually adapts retrieval embeddings from live interactions using minimal feedback (e.g., task success). Online-Optimized RAG applies lightweight online gradient updates with negligible per-query latency and requires no changes to the underlying LLM. The method is plug-and-play: it supports both single- and multi-hop tool use, dynamic tool inventories, and $K$-retrieval with re-ranking. We provide a problem-dependent theoretical analysis that quantifies how the method's performance depends on the initialization quality of the embeddings and other related quantities. Across diverse tool-use and document-retrieval scenarios, our Online-Optimized RAG consistently improves tool selection accuracy and end-task success, thus providing a simple, practical path to robust, self-improving RAG systems.</p></details> |  |

This is particularly challenging in scenarios requiring multi-step interactions with complex parameterization and nested API dependencies. Addressing these challenges, this work contributes to the evaluation and assessment of AI-based software development through three key advancements: (1) the introduction of a novel dataset specifically designed for benchmarking API function selection, parameter generation, and nested API execution; (2) an empirical evaluation of state-of-the-art language models, analyzing their performance across varying task complexities in API function generation and parameter accuracy; and (3) a hybrid approach to API routing, combining general-purpose large language models for API selection with fine-tuned models and prompt engineering for parameter generation. These innovations significantly improve API execution in chatbot systems, offering practical methodologies for enhancing software design, testing, and operational workflows in real-world software engineering contexts.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce HammerBench, a novel benchmark framework for assessing LLMs' function-calling capabilities in real-world, multi-turn dialogues. HammerBench simulates diverse mobile assistant use cases, incorporating imperfect instructions, dynamic question-answer trajectories, intent and argument shifts, and the indirect use of external information through pronouns. To construct this benchmark, we curate a comprehensive dataset derived from popular mobile app functionalities and anonymized user logs, complemented by a cost-effective data generation pipeline leveraging open-source models. HammerBench is further augmented with fine-grained interaction snapshots and metrics, enabling detailed evaluation of function-calling performance across individual conversational turns. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HammerBench by evaluating several leading LLMs and uncovering key performance trends. Our experiments reveal that different types of parameter name errors are a significant source of failure across different interaction scenarios, highlighting critical areas for further improvement in LLM robustness for mobile assistant applications.</p></details> |  |

However, effectively combining reasoning processes with accurate function execution remains a significant challenge. Traditional training approaches often struggle to balance the detailed reasoning steps with the precision of function calls, leading to suboptimal performance. To address these limitations, we introduce FunReason, a novel framework that enhances LLMs' function calling capabilities through an automated data refinement strategy and a Self-Refinement Multiscale Loss (SRML) approach. FunReason leverages LLMs' natural reasoning abilities to generate high-quality training examples, focusing on query parseability, reasoning coherence, and function call precision. The SRML approach dynamically balances the contribution of reasoning processes and function call accuracy during training, addressing the inherent trade-off between these two critical aspects. FunReason achieves performance comparable to GPT-4o while effectively mitigating catastrophic forgetting during fine-tuning. FunReason provides a comprehensive solution for enhancing LLMs' function calling capabilities by introducing a balanced training methodology and a data refinement pipeline.

| **[ReF Decompile: Relabeling and Function Call Enhanced Decompile](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.12221v1)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The goal of decompilation is to convert compiled low-level code (e.g., assembly code) back into high-level programming languages, enabling analysis in scenarios where source code is unavailable. This task supports various reverse engineering applications, such as vulnerability identification, malware analysis, and legacy software migration. The end-to-end decompile method based on large langauge models (LLMs) reduces reliance on additional tools and minimizes manual intervention due to its inherent properties. However, previous end-to-end methods often lose critical information necessary for reconstructing control flow structures and variables when processing binary files, making it challenging to accurately recover the program's logic. To address these issues, we propose the \textbf{ReF Decompile} method, which incorporates the following innovations: (1) The Relabelling strategy replaces jump target addresses with labels, preserving control flow clarity. (2) The Function Call strategy infers variable types and retrieves missing variable information from binary files. Experimental results on the Humaneval-Decompile Benchmark demonstrate that ReF Decompile surpasses comparable baselines and achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance of $61.43\%$.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Reliable Benchmarking: A Contamination Free, Controllable Evaluation Framework for Multi-step LLM Function Calling](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.26553v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As language models gain access to external tools via structured function calls, they become increasingly more capable of solving complex, multi-step tasks. However, existing benchmarks for tool-augmented language models (TaLMs) provide insufficient control over factors such as the number of functions accessible, task complexity, and input size, and remain vulnerable to data contamination. We present FuncBenchGen, a unified, contamination-free framework that evaluates TaLMs by generating synthetic multi-step tool-use tasks. The key idea is to cast tool use as traversal over a hidden function-dependency DAG where nodes are function calls and an edge between nodes represents one function consuming the output of another. Given a set of external function schemas, initial variable values, and a target variable, models must compose the correct call sequence to compute the target variable. FuncBenchGen allows users to precisely control task difficulty (e.g., graph size, dependency depth, and distractor functions) while avoiding data leakage. We apply our FuncBenchGen framework to evaluate seven LLMs on tool use tasks of varying difficulty. Reasoning-optimized models consistently outperform general-purpose models with GPT-5 significantly outperforming other models. Performance declines sharply as dependency depth increases. Furthermore, connected irrelevant functions prove especially difficult to handle. We find that strong models often make syntactically valid function calls but propagate incorrect or stale argument values across steps, revealing brittle state tracking by LLMs in multi-turn tool use. Motivated by this observation, we introduce a simple mitigation strategy that explicitly restates prior variable values to the agent at each step. Surprisingly, this lightweight change yields substantial gains across models. e.g., yielding a success rate improvement from 62.5% to 81.3% for GPT-5.</p></details> |  |
| **[Better Context Makes Better Code Language Models: A Case Study on Function Call Argument Completion](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.00381v1)** | 2023-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pretrained code language models have enabled great progress towards program synthesis. However, common approaches only consider in-file local context and thus miss information and constraints imposed by other parts of the codebase and its external dependencies. Existing code completion benchmarks also lack such context. To resolve these restrictions we curate a new dataset of permissively licensed Python packages that includes full projects and their dependencies and provide tools to extract non-local information with the help of program analyzers. We then focus on the task of function call argument completion which requires predicting the arguments to function calls. We show that existing code completion models do not yield good results on our completion task. To better solve this task, we query a program analyzer for information relevant to a given function call, and consider ways to provide the analyzer results to different code completion models during inference and training. Our experiments show that providing access to the function implementation and function usages greatly improves the argument completion performance. Our ablation study provides further insights on how different types of information available from the program analyzer and different ways of incorporating the information affect the model performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages.

| **[Optimizing Small Language Models for In-Vehicle Function-Calling](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.02342v1)** | 2025-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a holistic approach for deploying Small Language Models (SLMs) as function-calling agents within vehicles as edge devices, offering a more flexible and robust alternative to traditional rule-based systems. By leveraging SLMs, we simplify vehicle control mechanisms and enhance the user experience. Given the in-vehicle hardware constraints, we apply state-of-the-art model compression techniques, including structured pruning, healing, and quantization, ensuring that the model fits within the resource limitations while maintaining acceptable performance. Our work focuses on optimizing a representative SLM, Microsoft's Phi-3 mini, and outlines best practices for enabling embedded models, including compression, task-specific fine-tuning, and vehicle integration. We demonstrate that, despite significant reduction in model size which removes up to 2 billion parameters from the original model, our approach preserves the model's ability to handle complex in-vehicle tasks accurately and efficiently. Furthermore, by executing the model in a lightweight runtime environment, we achieve a generation speed of 11 tokens per second, making real-time, on-device inference feasible without hardware acceleration. Our results demonstrate the potential of SLMs to transform vehicle control systems, enabling more intuitive interactions between users and their vehicles for an enhanced driving experience.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Large Language Models Function Calling and Interpretability via Guided-Structured Templates](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.18076v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong reasoning and tool-use capabilities, yet they often fail in real-world tool-interactions due to incorrect parameterization, poor tool selection, or misinterpretation of user intent. These issues often stem from an incomplete understanding of user goals and inadequate comprehension of tool documentation. While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has proven effective for enhancing reasoning in general contexts, our analysis reveals that free-form CoT is insufficient and sometimes counterproductive for structured function-calling tasks. To address this, we introduce a curriculum-inspired framework that leverages structured reasoning templates to guide LLMs through more deliberate step-by-step instructions for generating function callings. Experimental results show that our method reduces tool-use errors, achieving 3-12% relative improvements over strong baselines across diverse model series and approaches. Moreover, our framework enhances the robustness, interpretability, and transparency of tool-using agents, advancing the development of more reliable AI assistants for real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2025 Main Conference</p></details> |

This paper proposes a novel graph neural network architecture combined with a novel graph data representation called call graphlets. A call graphlet encodes the neighborhood around each function in a binary executable, capturing the local and global context through a series of statistical features. A specialized graph neural network model operates on this graph representation, learning to map it to a feature vector that encodes semantic binary code similarities using deep-metric learning. The proposed approach is evaluated across five distinct datasets covering different architectures, compiler tool chains, and optimization levels. Experimental results show that the combination of call graphlets and the novel graph neural network architecture achieves comparable or state-of-the-art performance compared to baseline techniques across cross-architecture, mono-architecture and zero shot tasks. In addition, our proposed approach also performs well when evaluated against an out-of-domain function inlining task. The work provides a general and effective graph neural network-based solution for conducting binary code similarity detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, Under-Review</p></details> |

In digital content creation tools, where users express their needs through natural language queries that must be mapped to API calls, the lack of real-world task-specific data and privacy constraints for training on it necessitate synthetic data generation. Existing approaches to synthetic data generation fall short in diversity and complexity, failing to replicate real-world data distributions and leading to suboptimal performance after LLM fine-tuning. We present a novel router-based architecture that leverages domain resources like content metadata and structured knowledge graphs, along with text-to-text and vision-to-text language models to generate high-quality synthetic training data. Our architecture's flexible routing mechanism enables synthetic data generation that matches observed real-world distributions, addressing a fundamental limitation of traditional approaches. Evaluation on a comprehensive set of real user queries demonstrates significant improvements in both function classification accuracy and API parameter selection. Models fine-tuned with our synthetic data consistently outperform traditional approaches, establishing new benchmarks for function calling tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the 4th International Workshop on Knowledge-Augmented Methods for Natural Language Processing</p></details> |

As new/unknown malware families occur regularly, it is difficult to exhaust samples that cover all the classes for the training process in ML systems. An advanced malware classification system should classify the known classes correctly while sensitive to the unknown class. In this paper, we introduce a self-supervised pre-training approach for the OSR problem in malware classification. We propose two transformations for the function call graph (FCG) based malware representations to facilitate the pretext task. Also, we present a statistical thresholding approach to find the optimal threshold for the unknown class. Moreover, the experiment results indicate that our proposed pre-training process can improve different performances of different downstream loss functions for the OSR problem.</p></details> |  |

Experimental results show 60-80% code reduction across integration scenarios, performance improvements up to 3.1x through optimized concurrency, and full compatibility with existing function calling standards.

However, their effectiveness in task-oriented dialogues (TOD), which requires not only response generation but also effective dialogue state tracking (DST) within specific tasks and domains, remains less satisfying. In this work, we propose a novel approach FnCTOD for solving DST with LLMs through function calling. This method improves zero-shot DST, allowing adaptation to diverse domains without extensive data collection or model tuning. Our experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves exceptional performance with both modestly sized open-source and also proprietary LLMs: with in-context prompting it enables various 7B or 13B parameter models to surpass the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) achieved by ChatGPT, and improves ChatGPT's performance beating the SOTA by 5.6% average joint goal accuracy (JGA). Individual model results for GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 are boosted by 4.8% and 14%, respectively. We also show that by fine-tuning on a small collection of diverse task-oriented dialogues, we can equip modestly sized models, specifically a 13B parameter LLaMA2-Chat model, with function-calling capabilities and DST performance comparable to ChatGPT while maintaining their chat capabilities.

Such problems often demand numerous function evaluations to approximate the global optimum, which can be prohibitive in terms of time, energy, or resources. In this work, we introduce Every Call is Precious (ECP), a novel global optimization algorithm that minimizes unpromising evaluations by strategically focusing on potentially optimal regions. Unlike previous approaches, ECP eliminates the need to estimate the Lipschitz constant, thereby avoiding additional function evaluations. ECP guarantees no-regret performance for infinite evaluation budgets and achieves minimax-optimal regret bounds within finite budgets. Extensive ablation studies validate the algorithm's robustness, while empirical evaluations show that ECP outperforms 10 benchmark algorithms including Lipschitz, Bayesian, bandits, and evolutionary methods across 30 multi-dimensional non-convex synthetic and real-world optimization problems, which positions ECP as a competitive approach for global optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AISTATS 2025</p></details> |

However, the mechanisms through which it influences model behavior remain largely under-explored. Besides, we discover that in addition to the regular usage of FC, this technique can substantially enhance the compliance of LLMs with user instructions. These observations motivate us to leverage causality, a canonical analysis method, to investigate how FC works within LLMs. In particular, we conduct layer-level and token-level causal interventions to dissect FC's impact on the model's internal computational logic when responding to user queries. Our analysis confirms the substantial influence of FC and reveals several in-depth insights into its mechanisms. To further validate our findings, we conduct extensive experiments comparing the effectiveness of FC-based instructions against conventional prompting methods. We focus on enhancing LLM safety robustness, a critical LLM application scenario, and evaluate four mainstream LLMs across two benchmark datasets. The results are striking: FC shows an average performance improvement of around 135% over conventional prompting methods in detecting malicious inputs, demonstrating its promising potential to enhance LLM reliability and capability in practical applications.</p></details> |  |

However, without expertise in GIS, they continue to encounter limitations. To address these issues, we propose GeoJSON Agents-a multi-agent LLM architecture. This framework transforms natural language tasks into structured GeoJSON operation commands and processes spatial data using two widely adopted LLM enhancement techniques: Function Calling and Code Generation. The architecture consists of three components-task parsing, agent collaboration, and result integration-aimed at enhancing both the performance and scalability of GIS automation. The Planner agent interprets natural language tasks into structured GeoJSON commands. Then, specialized Worker agents collaborate according to assigned roles to perform spatial data processing and analysis, either by invoking predefined function APIs or by dynamically generating and executing Python-based spatial analysis code. Finally, the system integrates the outputs from multiple execution rounds into reusable, standards-compliant GeoJSON files. To systematically evaluate the performance of the two approaches, we constructed a benchmark dataset of 70 tasks with varying complexity and conducted experiments using OpenAI's GPT-4o as the core model. Results indicate that the Function Calling-based GeoJSON Agent achieved an accuracy of 85.71%, while the Code Generation-based agent reached 97.14%, both significantly outperforming the best-performing general-purpose model (48.57%). Further analysis reveals that the Code Generation provides greater flexibility, whereas the Function Calling approach offers more stable execution. This study is the first to introduce an LLM multi-agent framework for GeoJSON data and to compare the strengths and limitations of two mainstream LLM enhancement methods, offering new perspectives for improving GeoAI system performance.</p></details> |  |

As this ability becomes increasingly central to advanced AI systems, the need for high-quality, multi-turn training data to develop and refine it cannot be overstated. Existing data synthesis methods, such as random environment sampling or multi-agent role-playing, are not powerful enough to generate high-quality data in real-world environments. Practical challenges come in three folds: targeted model training, isolation of tool architecture, and multi-turn logical dependency. To address these structural deficiencies, we present FunReason-MT, a novel data synthesis framework for real-world multi-turn tool use. FunReason-MT resolves the complexity barrier in multi-turn FC data by employing 1) Environment-API Graph Interactions to gather varied high-quality trajectories, 2) Advanced Tool-Query Synthesis to simplify hard query construction, and 3) Guided Iterative Chain for sophisticated CoT generation. Evaluations on Berkeley Function-Calling Leaderboard (BFCLv3) demonstrate the power of our framework: a 4B model built upon FunReason-MT generated data achieves state-of-the-art performance among comparable-sized models, outperforming most close-source models. Further performance improvements on BFCLv4 confirm that FunReason-MT provides a reliable and robust source for agentic learning.</p></details> |  |

Graphs are integral to a wide range of applications, including motion planning for autonomous vehicles, social networks, scene understanding, and knowledge graphs. Many problems, even those not initially perceived as graph-based, can be effectively addressed through graph theory. However, when applied to these tasks, LLMs often encounter challenges, such as hallucinations and mathematical inaccuracies. To overcome these limitations, we propose Graph-Grounded LLMs, a system that improves LLM performance on graph-related tasks by integrating a graph library through function calls. By grounding LLMs in this manner, we demonstrate significant reductions in hallucinations and improved mathematical accuracy in solving graph-based problems, as evidenced by the performance on the NLGraph benchmark. Finally, we showcase a disaster rescue application where the Graph-Grounded LLM acts as a decision-support system.</p></details> |  |

Rather than synthesizing complete SQL via text-to-SQL, our system routes user requests to a small library of vetted, parameterized queries, trading generative flexibility for reliability, low latency, and cost efficiency. We empirically study three questions: (RQ1) whether LLMs alone can reliably recall or extrapolate time-dependent financial data without external retrieval; (RQ2) how well LLMs map company names to stock ticker symbols; and (RQ3) whether function calling outperforms text-to-SQL for end-to-end database query processing. Across controlled experiments on prices and fundamentals, LLM-only predictions exhibit non-negligible error and show look-ahead bias primarily for stock prices relative to model knowledge cutoffs. Ticker-mapping accuracy is near-perfect for NASDAQ-100 constituents and high for S\&P~500 firms. Finally, FinAI Data Assistant achieves lower latency and cost and higher reliability than a text-to-SQL baseline on our task suite.

When faced with multi-step tool usage, LLMs still struggle with tool selection, parameter generation, and tool-chain planning. Existing methods typically rely on manually designing task-specific demonstrations, or retrieving from a curated library. These approaches demand substantial expert effort and prompt engineering becomes increasingly complex and inefficient as tool diversity and task difficulty scale. To address these challenges, we propose a self-guided method, Stepwise Experience Recall (SEER), which performs fine-grained, stepwise retrieval from a continually updated experience pool. Instead of relying on static or manually curated library, SEER incrementally augments the experience pool with past successful trajectories, enabling continuous expansion of the pool and improved model performance over time. Evaluated on the ToolQA benchmark, SEER achieves an average improvement of 6.1% on easy and 4.7% on hard questions. We further test SEER on $τ$-bench, which includes two real-world domains. Powered by Qwen2.5-7B and Qwen2.5-72B models, SEER demonstrates substantial accuracy gains of 7.44% and 23.38%, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2025</p></details> |

Traditionally, natural language to SQL (NL-to-SQL) approaches have been explored for querying such data. While NL-to-SQL promises ease of use, it poses significant risks: end-users cannot easily validate generated SQL queries, and legacy nuclear plant databases -- often complex and poorly structured -- complicate query generation due to decades of incremental modifications. These challenges increase the likelihood of inaccuracies and reduce trust in the approach. In this work, we propose an alternative paradigm: leveraging function-calling large language models (LLMs) to address these challenges. Instead of directly generating SQL queries, we define a set of pre-approved, purpose-specific functions representing common use cases. Queries are processed by invoking these functions, which encapsulate validated SQL logic. This hybrid approach mitigates the risks associated with direct NL-to-SQL translations by ensuring that SQL queries are reviewed and optimized by experts before deployment. While this strategy introduces the upfront cost of developing and maintaining the function library, we demonstrate how NL-to-SQL tools can assist in the initial generation of function code, allowing experts to focus on validation rather than creation. Our study includes a performance comparison between direct NL-to-SQL generation and the proposed function-based approach, highlighting improvements in accuracy and maintainability. This work underscores the importance of balancing user accessibility with operational safety and provides a novel, actionable framework for robust data retrieval in critical systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>44th ...</summary><p>44th Annual CNS Conference and the 49th Annual CNS/CNA Student Conference, Westin Harbour Castle Hotel, Toronto, ON, Canada, June 8-11, 2025</p></details> |

Developers are encouraged to update any outdated dependency to remain safe from potential threats of vulnerabilities. In this study, we present an approach to aid developers show whether or not a vulnerable code is reachable for JavaScript projects. Our prototype, SōjiTantei, is evaluated in two ways (i) the accuracy when compared to a manual approach and (ii) a larger-scale analysis of 780 clients from 78 security vulnerability cases. The first evaluation shows that SōjiTantei has a high accuracy of 83.3%, with a speed of less than a second analysis per client.

The proliferation of open-source software (OSS) repositories has stressed the need to reuse available software artifacts efficiently. To this aim, it is necessary to explore approaches to mine data from software repositories and leverage it to produce helpful recommendations. We designed and implemented FOCUS as a novel approach to provide developers with API calls and source code while they are programming. The system works on the basis of a context-aware collaborative filtering technique to extract API usages from OSS projects. In this work, we show the suitability of FOCUS for Android programming by evaluating it on a dataset of 2,600 mobile apps. The empirical evaluation results show that our approach outperforms two state-of-the-art API recommenders, UP-Miner and PAM, in terms of prediction accuracy. We also point out that there is no significant relationship between the categories for apps defined in Google Play and their API usages. Finally, we show that participants of a user study positively perceive the API and source code recommended by FOCUS as relevant to the current development context.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 11 figures, accepted for publication at IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering (TSE)</p></details> |

Conventional keyword-based data augmentation methods often produce unrealistic sounds due to their reliance on manually defined labels, limiting scalability as machine types and anomaly patterns diversify. Advanced audio generative models, such as MIMII-Gen, show promise but typically depend on anomalous training data, making them less effective when diverse anomalous examples are unavailable. To address these limitations, we propose a novel synthesis approach leveraging large language models (LLMs) to interpret textual descriptions of faults and automatically select audio transformation functions, converting normal machine sounds into diverse and plausible anomalous sounds. We validate this approach by evaluating a UASD system trained only on normal sounds from five machine types, using both real and synthetic anomaly data. Experimental results reveal consistent trends in relative detection difficulty across machine types between synthetic and real anomalies. This finding supports our hypothesis and highlights the effectiveness of the proposed LLM-based synthesis approach for relative evaluation of UASD systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Application Level Authentication for Ethereum Private Blockchain Atomic Crosschain Transactions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.08083v1)** | 2019-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Atomic Crosschain Transaction technology allows composable programming across private Ethereum blockchains. It allows for inter-contract and inter-blockchain function calls that are both synchronous and atomic: if one part fails, the whole call graph of function calls is rolled back. Traditional Ethereum contract functions can limit which accounts can call them by specialised application program logic. This is important as it allows application developers to specify which callers can execute functions that update contract state. In this paper we introduce the strategy required to restrict which contracts on one blockchain can call a function in a contract that is deployed on another blockchain. We show that validating the Originating Blockchain Id (the blockchain the crosschain function call started on), From Blockchain Id, and From Account provides contracts with certainty that a function call came from a specific contract on a specific blockchain.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Function Orchestration for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.14872v2)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Function calling is a fundamental capability of today's large language models, but sequential function calling posed efficiency problems. Recent studies have proposed to request function calls with parallelism support in order to alleviate this issue. However, they either delegate the concurrent function calls to users for execution which are conversely executed sequentially, or overlook the relations among various function calls, rending limited efficiency. This paper introduces LLMOrch, an advanced framework for automated, parallel function calling in large language models. The key principle behind LLMOrch is to identify an available processor to execute a function call while preventing any single processor from becoming overburdened. To this end, LLMOrch models the data relations (i.e., def-use) among different function calls and coordinates their executions by their control relations (i.e., mutual-exclusion) as well as the working status of the underlying processors. When comparing with state-of-the-art techniques, LLMOrch demonstrated comparable efficiency improvements in orchestrating I/O-intensive functions, while significantly outperforming (2$\times$) them with compute-intensive functions. LLMOrch's performance even showed a linear correlation to the number of allocated processors. We believe that these results highlight the potential of LLMOrch as an efficient solution for parallel function orchestration in the context of large language models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering (TSE), 2025</p></details> |
| **[A type system for Continuation Calculus](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.3313v1)** | 2014-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continuation Calculus (CC), introduced by Geron and Geuvers, is a simple foundational model for functional computation. It is closely related to lambda calculus and term rewriting, but it has no variable binding and no pattern matching. It is Turing complete and evaluation is deterministic. Notions like "call-by-value" and "call-by-name" computation are available by choosing appropriate function definitions: e.g. there is a call-by-value and a call-by-name addition function. In the present paper we extend CC with types, to be able to define data types in a canonical way, and functions over these data types, defined by iteration. Data type definitions follow the so-called "Scott encoding" of data, as opposed to the more familiar "Church encoding". The iteration scheme comes in two flavors: a call-by-value and a call-by-name iteration scheme. The call-by-value variant is a double negation variant of call-by-name iteration. The double negation translation allows to move between call-by-name and call-by-value.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings CL&C 2014, arXiv:1409.2593</p></details> |
| **[Towards Optimal Use of Exception Handling Information for Function Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.03168v1)** | 2021-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Function entry detection is critical for security of binary code. Conventional methods heavily rely on patterns, inevitably missing true functions and introducing errors. Recently, call frames have been used in exception-handling for function start detection. However, existing methods have two problems. First, they combine call frames with heuristic-based approaches, which often brings error and uncertain benefits. Second, they trust the fidelity of call frames, without handling the errors that are introduced by call frames. In this paper, we first study the coverage and accuracy of existing approaches in detecting function starts using call frames. We found that recursive disassembly with call frames can maximize coverage, and using extra heuristic-based approaches does not improve coverage and actually hurts accuracy. Second, we unveil call-frame errors and develop the first approach to fix them, making their use more reliable.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporarily Restricting Solidity Smart Contract Interactions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.09084v1)** | 2024-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work we explore ways to restrict the ability to call Solidity smart contract functions for a specified duration. We describe methods to restrict functions from being called twice in the same transaction, block, or time period. This is related to the notion of non-reentrant functions, which are functions that can be called within a previous execution. These methods can be used to restrict interactions with entire sets of functions of smart contracts. We are motivated to revisit this topic for two reasons. First, we note that sixteen real-world smart contracts exploits in 2023 resulting in over $136M USD lost or stolen that could have been prevented by restricting function calls. As part of this survey, we dissect a new class of exploit that involves so-called read-only reentrancy: exploits that re-enter read-only functions to make smart contract state inconsistent in order to enable their exploitation. Second, while some of these approaches are simple, they may not always behave the same across different blockchains that support Solidity.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to DAPPS 2024. 11 pages, 5 Figures</p></details> |

Most higher-order flow analyses, including k-CFA, do not handle call and return well: they remember only a bounded number of pending calls because they approximate programs with control-flow graphs. Call/return mismatch introduces precision-degrading spurious control-flow paths and increases the analysis time. We describe CFA2, the first flow analysis with precise call/return matching in the presence of higher-order functions and tail calls. We formulate CFA2 as an abstract interpretation of programs in continuation-passing style and describe a sound and complete summarization algorithm for our abstract semantics. A preliminary evaluation shows that CFA2 gives more accurate data-flow information than 0CFA and 1CFA.</p></details> | LMCS 7 (2:3) 2011 |
| **[Comparing One with Many -- Solving Binary2source Function Matching Under Function Inlining](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.15159v1)** | 2022-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Binary2source function matching is a fundamental task for many security applications, including Software Component Analysis (SCA). The "1-to-1" mechanism has been applied in existing binary2source matching works, in which one binary function is matched against one source function. However, we discovered that such mapping could be "1-to-n" (one query binary function maps multiple source functions), due to the existence of function inlining. To help conduct binary2source function matching under function inlining, we propose a method named O2NMatcher to generate Source Function Sets (SFSs) as the matching target for binary functions with inlining. We first propose a model named ECOCCJ48 for inlined call site prediction. To train this model, we leverage the compilable OSS to generate a dataset with labeled call sites (inlined or not), extract several features from the call sites, and design a compiler-opt-based multi-label classifier by inspecting the inlining correlations between different compilations. Then, we use this model to predict the labels of call sites in the uncompilable OSS projects without compilation and obtain the labeled function call graphs of these projects. Next, we regard the construction of SFSs as a sub-tree generation problem and design root node selection and edge extension rules to construct SFSs automatically. Finally, these SFSs will be added to the corpus of source functions and compared with binary functions with inlining. We conduct several experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of O2NMatcher and results show our method increases the performance of existing works by 6% and exceeds all the state-of-the-art works.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sound Approximation of Programs with Elementary Functions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.10274v1)** | 2018-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Elementary function calls are a common feature in numerical programs. While their implementions in library functions are highly optimized, their computation is nonetheless very expensive compared to plain arithmetic. Full accuracy is, however, not always needed. Unlike arithmetic, where the performance difference between for example single and double precision floating-point arithmetic is relatively small, elementary function calls provide a much richer tradeoff space between accuracy and efficiency. Navigating this space is challenging. First, generating approximations of elementary function calls which are guaranteed to satisfy accuracy error bounds is highly nontrivial. Second, the performance of such approximations generally depends on several parameters which are unintuitive to choose manually, especially for non-experts. We present a fully automated approach and tool which approximates elementary function calls inside small programs while guaranteeing overall user provided error bounds. Our tool leverages existing techniques for roundoff error computation and approximation of individual elementary function calls, and provides automated selection of many parameters. Our experiments show that significant efficiency improvements are possible in exchange for reduced, but guaranteed, accuracy.</p></details> |  |

The resulting system represents transitions of the whole execution environment with a call stack. More precisely, we prepare a function symbol for the whole environment, which stores values for global variables and a call stack as its arguments. For a function call, we prepare rewrite rules to push the frame to the stack and to pop it after the execution. Any running frame is located at the top of the stack, and statements accessing global variables are represented by rewrite rules for the environment symbol.

However, their performance may be limited in complex, multi-turn interactions involving users and multiple tools. To address this, we propose Magnet, a principled framework for synthesizing high-quality training trajectories to enhance the function calling capability of large language model agents in multi-turn conversations with humans. The framework is based on automatic and iterative translations from a function signature path to a sequence of queries and executable function calls. We model the complicated function interactions in multi-turn cases with graph and design novel node operations to build reliable signature paths. Motivated by context distillation, when guiding the generation of positive and negative trajectories using a teacher model, we provide reference function call sequences as positive hints in context and contrastive, incorrect function calls as negative hints. Experiments show that training with the positive trajectories with supervised fine-tuning and preference optimization against negative trajectories, our 14B model, Magnet-14B-mDPO, obtains 68.01 on BFCL-v3 and 73.30 on ToolQuery, surpassing the performance of the teacher model Gemini-1.5-pro-002 by a large margin in function calling.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 3 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

| **[HARMONIC: Harnessing LLMs for Tabular Data Synthesis and Privacy Protection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.02927v1)** | 2024-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data serves as the fundamental foundation for advancing deep learning, particularly tabular data presented in a structured format, which is highly conducive to modeling. However, even in the era of LLM, obtaining tabular data from sensitive domains remains a challenge due to privacy or copyright concerns. Hence, exploring how to effectively use models like LLMs to generate realistic and privacy-preserving synthetic tabular data is urgent. In this paper, we take a step forward to explore LLMs for tabular data synthesis and privacy protection, by introducing a new framework HARMONIC for tabular data generation and evaluation. In the tabular data generation of our framework, unlike previous small-scale LLM-based methods that rely on continued pre-training, we explore the larger-scale LLMs with fine-tuning to generate tabular data and enhance privacy. Based on idea of the k-nearest neighbors algorithm, an instruction fine-tuning dataset is constructed to inspire LLMs to discover inter-row relationships. Then, with fine-tuning, LLMs are trained to remember the format and connections of the data rather than the data itself, which reduces the risk of privacy leakage. In the evaluation part of our framework, we develop specific privacy risk metrics DLT for LLM synthetic data generation, as well as performance evaluation metrics LLE for downstream LLM tasks. Our experiments find that this tabular data generation framework achieves equivalent performance to existing methods with better privacy, which also demonstrates our evaluation framework for the effectiveness of synthetic data and privacy risks in LLM scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM Meeting Decision Trees on Tabular Data](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.17918v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tabular data have been playing a vital role in diverse real-world fields, including healthcare, finance, etc. With the recent success of Large Language Models (LLMs), early explorations of extending LLMs to the domain of tabular data have been developed. Most of these LLM-based methods typically first serialize tabular data into natural language descriptions, and then tune LLMs or directly infer on these serialized data. However, these methods suffer from two key inherent issues: (i) data perspective: existing data serialization methods lack universal applicability for structured tabular data, and may pose privacy risks through direct textual exposure, and (ii) model perspective: LLM fine-tuning methods struggle with tabular data, and in-context learning scalability is bottle-necked by input length constraints (suitable for few-shot learning). This work explores a novel direction of integrating LLMs into tabular data throughough logical decision tree rules as intermediaries, proposes a decision tree enhancer with LLM-derived rule for tabular prediction, DeLTa. The proposed DeLTa avoids tabular data serialization, and can be applied to full data learning setting without LLM fine-tuning. Specifically, we leverage the reasoning ability of LLMs to redesign an improved rule given a set of decision tree rules. Furthermore, we provide a calibration method for original decision trees via new generated rule by LLM, which approximates the error correction vector to steer the original decision tree predictions in the direction of ``errors'' reducing. Finally, extensive experiments on diverse tabular benchmarks show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[TabR1: Taming GRPO for tabular reasoning LLMs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.17385v2)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tabular prediction has traditionally relied on gradient-boosted decision trees and specialized deep learning models, which excel within tasks but provide limited interpretability and weak transfer across tables. Reasoning large language models (LLMs) promise cross-task adaptability with trans- parent reasoning traces, yet their potential has not been fully realized for tabular data. This paper presents TabR1, the first reasoning LLM for tabular prediction with multi-step reasoning. At its core is Permutation Relative Policy Optimization (PRPO), a simple yet efficient reinforcement learning method that encodes column-permutation invariance as a structural prior. By construct- ing multiple label-preserving permutations per sample and estimating advantages both within and across permutations, PRPO transforms sparse rewards into dense learning signals and improves generalization. With limited supervision, PRPO activates the reasoning ability of LLMs for tabular prediction, enhancing few-shot and zero-shot performance as well as interpretability. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that TabR1 achieves performance comparable to strong baselines under full-supervision fine-tuning. In the zero-shot setting, TabR1 approaches the performance of strong baselines under the 32-shot setting. Moreover, TabR1 (8B) substantially outperforms much larger LLMs across various tasks, achieving up to 53.17% improvement over DeepSeek-R1 (685B).</p></details> |  |
| **[How well do LLMs reason over tabular data, really?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.07453v3)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in natural language tasks, but less is known about their reasoning capabilities over tabular data. Prior analyses devise evaluation strategies that poorly reflect an LLM's realistic performance on tabular queries. Moreover, we have a limited understanding of the robustness of LLMs towards realistic variations in tabular inputs. Therefore, we ask: Can general-purpose LLMs reason over tabular data, really?, and focus on two questions 1) are tabular reasoning capabilities of general-purpose LLMs robust to real-world characteristics of tabular inputs, and 2) how can we realistically evaluate an LLM's performance on analytical tabular queries? Building on a recent tabular reasoning benchmark, we first surface shortcomings of its multiple-choice prompt evaluation strategy, as well as commonly used free-form text metrics such as SacreBleu and BERT-score. We show that an LLM-as-a-judge procedure yields more reliable performance insights and unveil a significant deficit in tabular reasoning performance of LLMs. We then extend the tabular inputs reflecting three common characteristics in practice: 1) missing values, 2) duplicate entities, and 3) structural variations. Experiments show that the tabular reasoning capabilities of general-purpose LLMs suffer from these variations, stressing the importance of improving their robustness for realistic tabular inputs.</p></details> | 10 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Tabular Transfer Learning via Prompting LLMs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.11063v1)** | 2024-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning with a limited number of labeled data is a central problem in real-world applications of machine learning, as it is often expensive to obtain annotations. To deal with the scarcity of labeled data, transfer learning is a conventional approach; it suggests to learn a transferable knowledge by training a neural network from multiple other sources. In this paper, we investigate transfer learning of tabular tasks, which has been less studied and successful in the literature, compared to other domains, e.g., vision and language. This is because tables are inherently heterogeneous, i.e., they contain different columns and feature spaces, making transfer learning difficult. On the other hand, recent advances in natural language processing suggest that the label scarcity issue can be mitigated by utilizing in-context learning capability of large language models (LLMs). Inspired by this and the fact that LLMs can also process tables within a unified language space, we ask whether LLMs can be effective for tabular transfer learning, in particular, under the scenarios where the source and target datasets are of different format. As a positive answer, we propose a novel tabular transfer learning framework, coined Prompt to Transfer (P2T), that utilizes unlabeled (or heterogeneous) source data with LLMs. Specifically, P2T identifies a column feature in a source dataset that is strongly correlated with a target task feature to create examples relevant to the target task, thus creating pseudo-demonstrations for prompts. Experimental results demonstrate that P2T outperforms previous methods on various tabular learning benchmarks, showing good promise for the important, yet underexplored tabular transfer learning problem. Code is available at https://github.com/jaehyun513/P2T.</p></details> | COLM 2024 |

With flexible few-shot reasoning, multimodal integration, and natural-language-based interpretability, large language models (LLMs) offer unprecedented opportunities for prediction with structured biomedical data. We propose a novel framework called TAP-GPT, Tabular Alzheimer's Prediction GPT, that adapts TableGPT2, a multimodal tabular-specialized LLM originally developed for business intelligence tasks, for AD diagnosis using structured biomarker data with small sample sizes. Our approach constructs few-shot tabular prompts using in-context learning examples from structured biomedical data and finetunes TableGPT2 using the parameter-efficient qLoRA adaption for a clinical binary classification task of AD or cognitively normal (CN). The TAP-GPT framework harnesses the powerful tabular understanding ability of TableGPT2 and the encoded prior knowledge of LLMs to outperform more advanced general-purpose LLMs and a tabular foundation model (TFM) developed for prediction tasks. To our knowledge, this is the first application of LLMs to the prediction task using tabular biomarker data, paving the way for future LLM-driven multi-agent frameworks in biomedical informatics.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by ACM-BCB'25: ACM Conference on Bioinformatics, Computational Biology, and Health Informatics [ACM SIGBio Best Paper Award]</p></details> |

JoLT uses the in-context learning capabilities of LLMs to define joint distributions over tabular data conditioned on user-specified side information about the problem, exploiting the vast repository of latent problem-relevant knowledge encoded in LLMs. JoLT defines joint distributions for multiple target variables with potentially heterogeneous data types without any data conversion, data preprocessing, special handling of missing data, or model training, making it accessible and efficient for practitioners. Our experiments show that JoLT outperforms competitive methods on low-shot single-target and multi-target tabular classification and regression tasks. Furthermore, we show that JoLT can automatically handle missing data and perform data imputation by leveraging textual side information. We argue that due to its simplicity and generality, JoLT is an effective approach for a wide variety of real prediction problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-FE: Automated Feature Engineering for Tabular Data with LLMs as Evolutionary Optimizers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.14434v2)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated feature engineering plays a critical role in improving predictive model performance for tabular learning tasks. Traditional automated feature engineering methods are limited by their reliance on pre-defined transformations within fixed, manually designed search spaces, often neglecting domain knowledge. Recent advances using Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled the integration of domain knowledge into the feature engineering process. However, existing LLM-based approaches use direct prompting or rely solely on validation scores for feature selection, failing to leverage insights from prior feature discovery experiments or establish meaningful reasoning between feature generation and data-driven performance. To address these challenges, we propose LLM-FE, a novel framework that combines evolutionary search with the domain knowledge and reasoning capabilities of LLMs to automatically discover effective features for tabular learning tasks. LLM-FE formulates feature engineering as a program search problem, where LLMs propose new feature transformation programs iteratively, and data-driven feedback guides the search process. Our results demonstrate that LLM-FE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, significantly enhancing the performance of tabular prediction models across diverse classification and regression benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM Attention Transplant for Transfer Learning of Tabular Data Across Disparate Domains](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.06161v1)** | 2025-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transfer learning of tabular data is non-trivial due to heterogeneity in the feature space across disparate domains. The limited success of traditional deep learning in tabular knowledge transfer can be advanced by leveraging large language models (LLMs). However, the efficacy of LLMs often stagnates for mixed data types structured in tables due to the limitations of text prompts and in-context learning. We propose a lightweight transfer learning framework that fine-tunes an LLM using source tabular data and transplants the LLM's selective $key$ and $value$ projection weights into a gated feature tokenized transformer (gFTT) built for tabular data. The gFTT model with cross-domain attention is fine-tuned using target tabular data for transfer learning, eliminating the need for shared features, LLM prompt engineering, and large-scale pretrained models. Our experiments using ten pairs of source-target data sets and 12 baselines demonstrate the superiority of the proposed LLM-attention transplant for transfer learning (LATTLE) method over traditional ML models, state-of-the-art deep tabular architectures, and transfer learning models trained on thousands to billions of tabular samples. The proposed attention transfer demonstrates an effective solution to learning relationships between data tables using an LLM in a low-resource learning environment. The source code for the proposed method is publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[AraTable: Benchmarking LLMs' Reasoning and Understanding of Arabic Tabular Data](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.18442v1)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The cognitive and reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) have enabled remarkable progress in natural language processing. However, their performance in interpreting structured data, especially in tabular formats, remains limited. Although benchmarks for English tabular data are widely available, Arabic is still underrepresented because of the limited availability of public resources and its unique language features. To address this gap, we present AraTable, a novel and comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the reasoning and understanding capabilities of LLMs when applied to Arabic tabular data. AraTable consists of various evaluation tasks, such as direct question answering, fact verification, and complex reasoning, involving a wide range of Arabic tabular sources. Our methodology follows a hybrid pipeline, where initial content is generated by LLMs and subsequently filtered and verified by human experts to ensure high dataset quality. Initial analyses using AraTable show that, while LLMs perform adequately on simpler tabular tasks such as direct question answering, they continue to face significant cognitive challenges when tasks require deeper reasoning and fact verification. This indicates that there are substantial opportunities for future work to improve performance on complex tabular reasoning tasks. We also propose a fully automated evaluation framework that uses a self-deliberation mechanism and achieves performance nearly identical to that of human judges. This research provides a valuable, publicly available resource and evaluation framework that can help accelerate the development of foundational models for processing and analysing Arabic structured data.</p></details> |  |

However, despite with intrinsic world knowledge, their application on structured tabular data prediction still lags behind, primarily due to the numerical insensitivity and modality discrepancy that brings a gap between LLM reasoning and statistical tabular learning. Unlike textual or vision data (e.g., electronic clinical notes or medical imaging data), tabular data is often presented in heterogeneous numerical values (e.g., CBC reports). This ubiquitous data format requires intensive expert annotation, and its numerical nature limits LLMs' capability to effectively transfer untapped domain expertise. In this paper, we propose SERSAL, a general self-prompting method by synergy learning with small models to enhance LLM tabular prediction in an unsupervised manner. Specifically, SERSAL utilizes the LLM's prior outcomes as original soft noisy annotations, which are dynamically leveraged to teach a better small student model. Reversely, the outcomes from the trained small model are used to teach the LLM to further refine its real capability. This process can be repeatedly applied to gradually distill refined knowledge for continuous progress. Comprehensive experiments on widely used medical domain tabular datasets show that, without access to gold labels, applying SERSAL to OpenAI GPT reasoning process attains substantial improvement compared to linguistic prompting methods, which serves as an orthogonal direction for tabular LLM, and increasing prompting bonus is observed as more powerful LLMs appear.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025.

However, LLMs can fail to generate predictions that satisfy group fairness, that is, produce equitable outcomes across groups. Critically, conventional debiasing approaches for natural language tasks do not directly translate to mitigating group unfairness in tabular settings. In this work, we systematically investigate four empirical approaches to improve group fairness of LLM predictions on tabular datasets, including fair prompt optimization, soft prompt tuning, strategic selection of few-shot examples, and self-refining predictions via chain-of-thought reasoning. Through experiments on four tabular datasets using both open-source and proprietary LLMs, we show the effectiveness of these methods in enhancing demographic parity while maintaining high overall performance. Our analysis provides actionable insights for practitioners in selecting the most suitable approach based on their specific requirements and constraints.</p></details> |  |
| **[TabularGSM: Understanding the Limitations of LLMs in Tabular Math Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.19563v2)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mathematical reasoning has long been a key benchmark for evaluating large language models (LLMs). Although substantial progress has been made on math word problems, the need for reasoning over tabular data in real-world applications has been overlooked. For instance, applications such as business intelligence demand not only multi-step numerical reasoning with tables but also robustness to incomplete or inconsistent information. However, comprehensive evaluation in this area is severely limited, constrained by the reliance on manually collected tables that are difficult to scale and the lack of coverage for potential traps encountered in real-world scenarios. To address this problem, we propose AutoT2T, a neuro-symbolic framework that controllably transforms math word problems into scalable and verified tabular reasoning tasks, enabling the evaluation of both accuracy and robustness. Building on this pipeline, we develop TabularGSM, a benchmark comprising three progressively complex subsets and a trap subset, with two complementary evaluation settings. Our study reveals three key observations: (1) Tabular structure makes mathematical reasoning more challenging; (2) The difficulties stem from the joint effects of tabular retrieval and reasoning; (3) Reasoning robustness is another significant issue that needs to be addressed in existing LLMs. In-depth analyses are conducted for each observation to guide future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper under review, code and dataset are all available</p></details> |

Existing methods deal with this heterogeneous nature of tabular data by employing separate type-specific encoding approaches. This limits the cross-table transfer potential and the exploitation of pre-trained knowledge. We propose a novel approach that first transforms tabular data into text, and then leverages pre-trained representations from LLMs to encode this data, resulting in a plug-and-play solution to improv ing deep-learning tabular methods. We demonstrate that our approach improves accuracy over competitive models, such as MLP, ResNet and FT-Transformer, by validating on seven classification datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tab-MIA: A Benchmark Dataset for Membership Inference Attacks on Tabular Data in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.17259v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained on tabular data, which, unlike unstructured text, often contains personally identifiable information (PII) in a highly structured and explicit format. As a result, privacy risks arise, since sensitive records can be inadvertently retained by the model and exposed through data extraction or membership inference attacks (MIAs). While existing MIA methods primarily target textual content, their efficacy and threat implications may differ when applied to structured data, due to its limited content, diverse data types, unique value distributions, and column-level semantics. In this paper, we present Tab-MIA, a benchmark dataset for evaluating MIAs on tabular data in LLMs and demonstrate how it can be used. Tab-MIA comprises five data collections, each represented in six different encoding formats. Using our Tab-MIA benchmark, we conduct the first evaluation of state-of-the-art MIA methods on LLMs finetuned with tabular data across multiple encoding formats. In the evaluation, we analyze the memorization behavior of pretrained LLMs on structured data derived from Wikipedia tables. Our findings show that LLMs memorize tabular data in ways that vary across encoding formats, making them susceptible to extraction via MIAs. Even when fine-tuned for as few as three epochs, models exhibit high vulnerability, with AUROC scores approaching 90% in most cases. Tab-MIA enables systematic evaluation of these risks and provides a foundation for developing privacy-preserving methods for tabular data in LLMs.</p></details> |  |

To leverage benefits like missing value imputation, labeling, and enrichment with context-aware attributes, LLM-generated data needs a critical validation process. The number of pioneering approaches is increasing fast, opening a promising validation space that, so far, remains unstructured. We present a design space for the critical validation of LLM-generated tabular data with two dimensions: First, the Analysis Granularity dimension: from within-attribute (single-item and multi-item) to across-attribute perspectives (1 x 1, 1 x m, and n x n). Second, the Data Source dimension: differentiating between LLM-generated values, ground truth values, explanations, and their combinations. We discuss analysis tasks for each dimension cross-cut, map 19 existing validation approaches, and discuss the characteristics of two approaches in detail, demonstrating descriptive power.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at the 16th International EuroVis Workshop on Visual Analytics (EuroVA'25)</p></details> |
| **[Automatic Demonstration Selection for LLM-based Tabular Data Classification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.20451v1)** | 2025-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A fundamental question in applying In-Context Learning (ICL) for tabular data classification is how to determine the ideal number of demonstrations in the prompt. This work addresses this challenge by presenting an algorithm to automatically select a reasonable number of required demonstrations. Our method distinguishes itself by integrating not only the tabular data's distribution but also the user's selected prompt template and the specific Large Language Model (LLM) into its estimation. Rooted in Spectral Graph Theory, our proposed algorithm defines a novel metric to quantify the similarities between different demonstrations. We then construct a similarity graph and analyze the eigenvalues of its Laplacian to derive the minimum number of demonstrations capable of representing the data within the LLM's intrinsic representation space. We validate the efficacy of our approach through experiments comparing its performance against conventional random selection algorithms on diverse datasets and LLMs.</p></details> |  |

Although gradient boosting machines and some recent deep models achieve strong performance on tabular data, they often lack interpretability. On the other hand, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated powerful capabilities to generate human-like reasoning and explanations, but remain under-performed for tabular data prediction. In this paper, we propose a new approach that leverages reasoning-based LLMs, trained using reinforcement learning, to perform more accurate and explainable predictions on tabular data. Our method introduces custom reward functions that guide the model not only toward better prediction accuracy but also toward human-understandable reasons for its predictions. The proposed method is evaluated on financial benchmark datasets and compared against established LLMs.</p></details> |  |

However, effectively utilizing advanced LLMs in few-shot and even zero-shot scenarios is still challenging. To this end, we propose a novel LLM-based prototype estimation framework for tabular learning. Our key idea is to query the LLM to generate feature values based example-free prompt, which solely relies on task and feature descriptions. With the feature values generated by LLM, we can build a zero-shot prototype in a training-free manner, which can be further enhanced by fusing few-shot samples, avoiding training a classifier or finetuning the LLMs. Thanks to the example-free prompt and prototype estimation, ours bypasses the constraints brought by the example-based prompt, providing a scalable and robust framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of ours in zero and few-shot tabular learning.</p></details> |  |

However, existing LLM-based methods suffer from high resource requirements, suboptimal demonstration selection, and limited interpretability, which largely hinder their prediction performance and application in the real world. To overcome these problems, we propose a novel in-context learning framework for tabular prediction. The core idea is to leverage the explanations generated by LLMs to guide a smaller, locally deployable Surrogate Language Model (SLM) to make interpretable tabular predictions. Specifically, our framework mainly involves three stages: (i) Post Hoc Explanation Generation, where LLMs are utilized to generate explanations for question-answer pairs in candidate demonstrations, providing insights into the reasoning behind the answer. (ii) Post Hoc Explanation-Guided Demonstrations Selection, which utilizes explanations generated by LLMs to guide the process of demonstration selection from candidate demonstrations. (iii) Post Hoc Explanation-Guided Interpretable SLM Prediction, which utilizes the demonstrations obtained in step (ii) as in-context and merges corresponding explanations as rationales to improve the performance of SLM and guide the model to generate interpretable outputs. Experimental results highlight the framework's effectiveness, with an average accuracy improvement of 5.31% across various tabular datasets in diverse domains.</p></details> |  |

We study table normalization as a stand-alone, one-time preprocessing step using LLMs to support symbolic reasoning on tabular data.

Recently, Large language models (LLMs) have become increasingly prevalent in tabular reasoning tasks. Previous work focuses on (1) finetuning LLMs using labeled data or (2) Training-free prompting LLM agents using chain-of-thought (CoT). Finetuning offers dataset-specific learning at the cost of generalizability. Training-free prompting is highly generalizable but does not take full advantage of training data. In this paper, we propose a novel prompting-based reasoning approach, Learn then Retrieve: LRTab, which integrates the benefits of both by retrieving relevant information learned from training data. We first use prompting to obtain CoT responses over the training data. For incorrect CoTs, we prompt the LLM to predict Prompt Conditions to avoid the error, learning insights from the data. We validate the effectiveness of Prompt Conditions using validation data. Finally, at inference time, we retrieve the most relevant Prompt Conditions for additional context for table understanding. We provide comprehensive experiments on WikiTQ and Tabfact, showing that LRTab is interpretable, cost-efficient, and can outperform previous baselines in tabular reasoning.</p></details> |  |

However, LLMs have been shown to exhibit harmful social biases that reflect the stereotypes and inequalities present in society. To this end, as well as the widespread use of tabular data in many high-stake applications, it is important to explore the following questions: what sources of information do LLMs draw upon when making classifications for tabular tasks; whether and to what extent are LLM classifications for tabular data influenced by social biases and stereotypes; and what are the consequential implications for fairness? Through a series of experiments, we delve into these questions and show that LLMs tend to inherit social biases from their training data which significantly impact their fairness in tabular classification tasks. Furthermore, our investigations show that in the context of bias mitigation, though in-context learning and finetuning have a moderate effect, the fairness metric gap between different subgroups is still larger than that in traditional machine learning models, such as Random Forest and shallow Neural Networks. This observation emphasizes that the social biases are inherent within the LLMs themselves and inherited from their pretraining corpus, not only from the downstream task datasets. Besides, we demonstrate that label-flipping of in-context examples can significantly reduce biases, further highlighting the presence of inherent bias within LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>NAACL...</summary><p>NAACL 2024 (Main Conference)</p></details> |

Since it is impossible to generalize to a completely new and unknown domain, we study models that are easy to adapt to the target domain even with few labeled examples. We focus on building more informative representations of tabular data that can mitigate $Y|X$-shifts, and propose to leverage the prior world knowledge in LLMs by serializing (write down) the tabular data to encode it. We find LLM embeddings alone provide inconsistent improvements in robustness, but models trained on them can be well adapted/finetuned to the target domain even using 32 labeled observations. Our finding is based on a comprehensive and systematic study consisting of 7650 source-target pairs and benchmark against 261,000 model configurations trained by 22 algorithms. Our observation holds when ablating the size of accessible target data and different adaptation strategies.

While prior work has shown the potential of LLMs to improve downstream task performance through augmenting underrepresented groups, these benefits often assume access to a subset of unbiased in-context examples, representative of the real dataset. In real-world settings, however, data is frequently noisy and demographically skewed. In this paper, we systematically study how statistical biases within in-context examples propagate to the distribution of synthetic tabular data, showing that even mild in-context biases lead to global statistical distortions. We further introduce an adversarial scenario where a malicious contributor can inject bias into the synthetic dataset via a subset of in-context examples, ultimately compromising the fairness of downstream classifiers for a targeted and protected subgroup. Our findings demonstrate a new vulnerability associated with LLM-based data generation pipelines that rely on in-context prompts with in sensitive domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted at ICML 2025 workshop DIG-BUG</p></details> |

Fine-tuning multiplicity can arise due to variations in the training process, e.g., seed, weight initialization, minor changes to training data, etc., raising concerns about the reliability of Tabular LLMs in high-stakes applications such as finance, hiring, education, healthcare. Our work formalizes this unique challenge of fine-tuning multiplicity in Tabular LLMs and proposes a novel measure to quantify the consistency of individual predictions without expensive model retraining. Our measure quantifies a prediction's consistency by analyzing (sampling) the model's local behavior around that input in the embedding space. Interestingly, we show that sampling in the local neighborhood can be leveraged to provide probabilistic guarantees on prediction consistency under a broad class of fine-tuned models, i.e., inputs with sufficiently high local stability (as defined by our measure) also remain consistent across several fine-tuned models with high probability. We perform experiments on multiple real-world datasets to show that our local stability measure preemptively captures consistency under actual multiplicity across several fine-tuned models, outperforming competing measures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inter...</summary><p>International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), 2025</p></details> |

Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have inspired a number of algorithm techniques for improving DP synthetic data generation. One family of approaches uses DP finetuning on the foundation model weights; however, the model weights for state-of-the-art models may not be public. In this work we propose two DP synthetic tabular data algorithms that only require API access to the foundation model. We adapt the Private Evolution algorithm (Lin et al., 2023; Xie et al., 2024) -- which was designed for image and text data -- to the tabular data domain. In our extension of Private Evolution, we define a query workload-based distance measure, which may be of independent interest. We propose a family of algorithms that use one-shot API access to LLMs, rather than adaptive queries to the LLM. Our findings reveal that API-access to powerful LLMs does not always improve the quality of DP synthetic data compared to established baselines that operate without such access. We provide insights into the underlying reasons and propose improvements to LLMs that could make them more effective for this application.</p></details> |  |

We introduce TabGemma, a schema-agnostic in-context learner that treats rows as sequences and tackles two practical hurdles when adapting pretrained LLMs for tabular predictions: unstable numeric tokenization and limited context size. We propose to canonicalize numbers via signed scientific notation and continue pretraining of a 12B Gemma 3 model with a target imputation objective using a large-scale real world dataset. For inference, we use a compact n-gram-based retrieval to select informative exemplars that fit within a 128k-token window. On semantically rich benchmarks, TabGemma establishes a new state of the art on classification across low- and high-data regimes and improves monotonically with more context rows. For regression, it is competitive at small sample sizes but trails conventional approaches as data grows. Our results show that LLMs can be effective tabular in-context learners on highly semantic tasks when paired with dedicated numeric handling and context retrieval, while motivating further advances in numeric modeling and long-context scaling.</p></details> |  |

Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown State-of-The-Art performance in Entity Linking (EL) tasks, their deployment in real-world scenarios requires not only accurate predictions but also reliable uncertainty estimates, which require resource-demanding multi-shot inference, posing serious limits to their actual applicability. As a more efficient alternative, we investigate a self-supervised approach for estimating uncertainty from single-shot LLM outputs using token-level features, reducing the need for multiple generations. Evaluation is performed on an EL task on tabular data across multiple LLMs, showing that the resulting uncertainty estimates are highly effective in detecting low-accuracy outputs. This is achieved at a fraction of the computational cost, ultimately supporting a cost-effective integration of uncertainty measures into LLM-based EL workflows. The method offers a practical way to incorporate uncertainty estimation into EL workflows with limited computational overhead.</p></details> |  |

The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has sparked interest in leveraging their pre-trained knowledge for few-shot tabular learning. Despite promising results, existing approaches either rely on test-time knowledge extraction, which introduces undesirable latency, or text-level knowledge, which leads to unreliable feature engineering. To overcome these limitations, we propose Latte, a training-time knowledge extraction framework that transfers the latent prior knowledge within LLMs to optimize a more generalized downstream model. Latte enables general knowledge-guided downstream tabular learning, facilitating the weighted fusion of information across different feature values while reducing the risk of overfitting to limited labeled data. Furthermore, Latte is compatible with existing unsupervised pre-training paradigms and effectively utilizes available unlabeled samples to overcome the performance limitations imposed by an extremely small labeled dataset. Extensive experiments on various few-shot tabular learning benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of Latte, establishing it as a state-of-the-art approach in this domain</p></details> |  |

| **[LLM-Symbolic Integration for Robust Temporal Tabular Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.05746v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal tabular question answering presents a significant challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs), requiring robust reasoning over structured data, which is a task where traditional prompting methods often fall short. These methods face challenges such as memorization, sensitivity to table size, and reduced performance on complex queries. To overcome these limitations, we introduce TempTabQA-C, a synthetic dataset designed for systematic and controlled evaluations, alongside a symbolic intermediate representation that transforms tables into database schemas. This structured approach allows LLMs to generate and execute SQL queries, enhancing generalization and mitigating biases. By incorporating adaptive few-shot prompting with contextually tailored examples, our method achieves superior robustness, scalability, and performance. Experimental results consistently highlight improvements across key challenges, setting a new benchmark for robust temporal reasoning with LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL Findings 2025</p></details> |

We propose a distant supervision method for training, which comprises a reasoning process extension strategy, aiding in training LLMs to understand reasoning patterns more effectively as well as a cross-way validation strategy, ensuring the quality of the automatically generated data. To evaluate the performance of TableLLM, we have crafted benchmarks tailored to address both document and spreadsheet formats as well as constructed a well-organized evaluation pipeline capable of handling both scenarios. Thorough evaluations underscore the advantages of TableLLM when compared to various existing general-purpose and tabular data-focused LLMs. We have publicly released the model checkpoint, source code, benchmarks, and a web application for user interaction.

Contemporary approaches adopt large language models (LLMs) for tabular augmentation, but exhibit two major limitations: (1) dense dependency modeling among tabular features that can introduce bias, and (2) high computational overhead in sampling. To address these issues, we propose SPADA for SPArse Dependency-driven Augmentation, a lightweight generative framework that explicitly captures sparse dependencies via an LLM-induced graph. We treat each feature as a node and synthesize values by traversing the graph, conditioning each feature solely on its parent nodes. We explore two synthesis strategies: a non-parametric method using Gaussian kernel density estimation, and a conditional normalizing flow model that learns invertible mappings for conditional density estimation. Experiments on four datasets show that SPADA reduces constraint violations by 4% compared to diffusion-based methods and accelerates generation by nearly 9,500 times over LLM-based baselines.</p></details> |  |

We introduce HyST (Hybrid retrieval over Semi-structured Tabular data), a hybrid retrieval framework that combines LLM-powered structured filtering with semantic embedding search to support complex information needs over semi-structured tabular data. HyST extracts attribute-level constraints from natural language using large language models (LLMs) and applies them as metadata filters, while processing the remaining unstructured query components via embedding-based retrieval. Experiments on a semi-structured benchmark show that HyST consistently outperforms tradtional baselines, highlighting the importance of structured filtering in improving retrieval precision, offering a scalable and accurate solution for real-world user queries.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 2nd EARL Workshop on Evaluating and Applying Recommender Systems with Large Language Models (RecSys 2025)</p></details> |
| **[StructSynth: Leveraging LLMs for Structure-Aware Tabular Data Synthesis in Low-Data Regimes](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02601v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The application of machine learning on tabular data in specialized domains is severely limited by data scarcity. While generative models offer a solution, traditional methods falter in low-data regimes, and recent Large Language Models (LLMs) often ignore the explicit dependency structure of tabular data, leading to low-fidelity synthetics. To address these limitations, we introduce StructSynth, a novel framework that integrates the generative power of LLMs with robust structural control. StructSynth employs a two-stage architecture. First, it performs explicit structure discovery to learn a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) from the available data. Second, this learned structure serves as a high-fidelity blueprint to steer the LLM's generation process, forcing it to adhere to the learned feature dependencies and thereby ensuring the generated data respects the underlying structure by design. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that StructSynth produces synthetic data with significantly higher structural integrity and downstream utility than state-of-the-art methods. It proves especially effective in challenging low-data scenarios, successfully navigating the trade-off between privacy preservation and statistical fidelity.</p></details> |  |

However, in addition to preserving global statistical properties, synthetic datasets must also maintain domain-specific logical consistency**-**especially in complex systems like supply chains, where fields such as shipment dates, locations, and product categories must remain logically consistent for real-world usability. Existing generative models often overlook these inter-column relationships, leading to unreliable synthetic tabular data in real-world applications. To address these challenges, we propose LLM-TabLogic, a novel approach that leverages Large Language Model reasoning to capture and compress the complex logical relationships among tabular columns, while these conditional constraints are passed into a Score-based Diffusion model for data generation in latent space. Through extensive experiments on real-world industrial datasets, we evaluate LLM-TabLogic for column reasoning and data generation, comparing it with five baselines including SMOTE and state-of-the-art generative models. Our results show that LLM-TabLogic demonstrates strong generalization in logical inference, achieving over 90% accuracy on unseen tables. Furthermore, our method outperforms all baselines in data generation by fully preserving inter-column relationships while maintaining the best balance between data fidelity, utility, and privacy. This study presents the first method to effectively preserve inter-column relationships in synthetic tabular data generation without requiring domain knowledge, offering new insights for creating logically consistent real-world tabular data.</p></details> |  |

We hypothesize that enriching prompts with domain-specific insights can improve both the quality and efficiency of data generation.

Recently, large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 have demonstrated strong multi-step reasoning capabilities. We then consider harnessing the amazing power of LLMs to solve our task. We abstract a Step-wise Pipeline for tabular and textual QA, which consists of three key steps, including Extractor, Reasoner and Executor, and initially design an instruction to instantiate the pipeline and validate that GPT-4 outperforms all existing methods. However, utilizing an online LLM like GPT-4 holds various challenges in terms of cost, latency, and data security risk, which motivates us to specialize smaller LLMs in this task. We develop a TAT-LLM language model by fine-tuning LLaMA 2 with the training data generated automatically from existing expert-annotated datasets following the Step-wise Pipeline. The experimental results have verified that our TAT-LLM model can outperform all baseline models, including the previous best fine-tuned models and very large-scale LLMs like GPT-4 on FinQA, TAT-QA and TAT-DQA benchmarks.</p></details> | Accepted by ICAIF 24 |

The SemEval 2025 Task 8 (DataBench) introduced a benchmark composed of large-scale, domain-diverse datasets to evaluate the ability of models to accurately answer structured queries. We propose a Natural Language to SQL (NL-to-SQL) approach leveraging large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, and DeepSeek v2:16b to generate SQL queries dynamically. Our system follows a multi-stage pipeline involving example selection, SQL query generation, answer extraction, verification, and iterative refinement. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving 70.5\% accuracy on DataBench QA and 71.6\% on DataBench Lite QA, significantly surpassing baseline scores of 26\% and 27\% respectively.

Hence, data augmentation methods to increase the sample size of datasets needed for ML are key to unlocking the transformative potential of ML in data-deprived regions and domains. Unfortunately, the limited training set constrains traditional tabular synthetic data generators in their ability to generate a large and diverse augmented dataset needed for ML tasks. To address this challenge, we introduce CLLM, which leverages the prior knowledge of Large Language Models (LLMs) for data augmentation in the low-data regime. However, not all the data generated by LLMs will improve downstream utility, as for any generative model. Consequently, we introduce a principled curation mechanism, leveraging learning dynamics, coupled with confidence and uncertainty metrics, to obtain a high-quality dataset. Empirically, on multiple real-world datasets, we demonstrate the superior performance of CLLM in the low-data regime compared to conventional generators. Additionally, we provide insights into the LLM generation and curation mechanism, shedding light on the features that enable them to output high-quality augmented datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at the 41st International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML) 2024. *Seedat & Huynh contributed equally</p></details> |

Leveraging advancements in natural language processing, this study presents a systematic approach to enrich tabular datasets with features derived from large language model embeddings. Through a comprehensive ablation study on diverse datasets, we assess the impact of RoBERTa and GPT-2 embeddings on ensemble classifiers, including Random Forest, XGBoost, and CatBoost. Results indicate that integrating embeddings with traditional numerical and categorical features often enhances predictive performance, especially on datasets with class imbalance or limited features and samples, such as UCI Adult, Heart Disease, Titanic, and Pima Indian Diabetes, with improvements particularly notable in XGBoost and CatBoost classifiers. Additionally, feature importance analysis reveals that LLM-derived features frequently rank among the most impactful for the predictions. This study provides a structured approach to embedding-based feature enrichment and illustrates its benefits in ensemble learning for tabular data.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we present TAGAL, a collection of methods able to generate synthetic tabular data using an agentic workflow. The methods leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) for an automatic and iterative process that uses feedback to improve the generated data without any further LLM training. The use of LLMs also allows for the addition of external knowledge in the generation process. We evaluate TAGAL across diverse datasets and different aspects of quality for the generated data. We look at the utility of downstream ML models, both by training classifiers on synthetic data only and by combining real and synthetic data. Moreover, we compare the similarities between the real and the generated data. We show that TAGAL is able to perform on par with state-of-the-art approaches that require LLM training and generally outperforms other training-free approaches. These findings highlight the potential of agentic workflow and open new directions for LLM-based data generation methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimized Feature Generation for Tabular Data via LLMs with Decision Tree Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.08527v2)** | 2024-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In tabular prediction tasks, tree-based models combined with automated feature engineering methods often outperform deep learning approaches that rely on learned representations. While these feature engineering techniques are effective, they typically depend on a pre-defined search space and primarily use validation scores for feature selection, thereby missing valuable insights from previous experiments. To address these limitations, we propose a novel tabular learning framework that utilizes large language models (LLMs), termed Optimizing Column feature generator with decision Tree reasoning (OCTree). Our key idea is to leverage the reasoning capabilities of LLMs to identify effective feature generation rules without manually specifying the search space and provide language-based reasoning information highlighting past experiments as feedback for iterative rule improvements. We use decision trees to convey this reasoning information, as they can be easily represented in natural language, effectively providing knowledge from prior experiments (i.e., the impact of the generated features on performance) to the LLMs. Our empirical results demonstrate that OCTree consistently enhances the performance of various prediction models across diverse benchmarks, outperforming competing automated feature engineering methods.

The primary objective of this task is to perform question answering on given tabular datasets from diverse domains under two subtasks: DataBench QA (Subtask I) and DataBench Lite QA (Subtask II). To tackle both subtasks, we developed a zero-shot solution with a particular emphasis on leveraging Large Language Model (LLM)-based code generation. Specifically, we propose a Python code generation framework utilizing state-of-the-art open-source LLMs to generate executable Pandas code via optimized prompting strategies. Our experiments reveal that different LLMs exhibit varying levels of effectiveness in Python code generation. Additionally, results show that Python code generation achieves superior performance in tabular question answering compared to alternative approaches. Although our ranking among zero-shot systems is unknown at the time of this paper's submission, our system achieved eighth place in Subtask I and sixth place in Subtask~II among the 30 systems that outperformed the baseline in the open-source models category.</p></details> |  |

An Evaluation Framework for Natural Language Representations of Text-to-SQL System Outputs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.23854v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In modern industry systems like multi-turn chat agents, Text-to-SQL technology bridges natural language (NL) questions and database (DB) querying. The conversion of tabular DB results into NL representations (NLRs) enables the chat-based interaction.

This paper introduces a novel evaluation method - Combo-Eval - for judgment of LLM-generated NLRs that combines the benefits of multiple existing methods, optimizing evaluation fidelity and achieving a significant reduction in LLM calls by 25-61%. Accompanying our method is NLR-BIRD, the first dedicated dataset for NLR benchmarking. Through human evaluations, we demonstrate the superior alignment of Combo-Eval with human judgments, applicable across scenarios with and without ground truth references.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP 2025</p></details> |

In this paper, we introduce Thinking with Tables, where we inject tabular structures into LLMs for data-analytics requests. Through comprehensive evaluations across various request types, we show that providing tabular structures yields a 40.29 percent average performance gain along with better robustness and token efficiency. Through attention-value analysis, we uncover that tables help LLMs better attend to relevant information, explaining these improvements. Beyond tables and text, we evaluate whether (1) blending structuredness within text, such as providing templates or fixing the order of attributes, and (2) other representative structures, such as knowledge graphs and JSON, are helpful. We observe that utilizing tables offers the best balance between efficiency and effectiveness. These advantages remain consistent under increased task complexity and even when all input data cannot be structured. Finally, as data analytics typically relies on structured factual inputs, our text-to-table conversion demonstrates the method's applicability to text-compatible data sources.</p></details> | 20 pages, 7 figures |

Dataset discovery methods aim to automatically identify related data assets in a data lake. The development and evaluation of such solutions for customers from a wide range of business domains, relies on diverse, high quality and domain-specific tabular benchmarks. Large language models (LLMs) are trained on a wide variety of text data, which can provide a strong foundation of general and domain-specific knowledge. In this paper, we ask the question -- \textit{can we leverage LLMs to generate a tabular benchmark adequate for evaluating the dataset discovery solutions?} In particular, we focus on the task of finding joinable tables which is the cornerstone of virtually every dataset discovery method. Current corpora for evaluating dataset discovery methods are mainly based on subsets of open data, and they suffer from three important issues: $i)$ they focus on very common and generic data types (e.g., address, id, name, etc.); $ii)$ they do not contain human-annotated column pairs; instead, practitioners synthesize ground truth using table splits (e.g., horizontal for table union search and vertical ones for joinability) and $iii)$ they do not focus on semantic column relationships.</p></details> | 13 pages |
| **[Tabular Data Understanding with LLMs: A Survey of Recent Advances and Challenges](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.00217v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tables have gained significant attention in large language models (LLMs) and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) due to their complex and flexible structure. Unlike linear text inputs, tables are two-dimensional, encompassing formats that range from well-structured database tables to complex, multi-layered spreadsheets, each with different purposes. This diversity in format and purpose has led to the development of specialized methods and tasks, instead of universal approaches, making navigation of table understanding tasks challenging. To address these challenges, this paper introduces key concepts through a taxonomy of tabular input representations and an introduction of table understanding tasks. We highlight several critical gaps in the field that indicate the need for further research: (1) the predominance of retrieval-focused tasks that require minimal reasoning beyond mathematical and logical operations; (2) significant challenges faced by models when processing complex table structures, large-scale tables, length context, or multi-table scenarios; and (3) the limited generalization of models across different tabular representations and formats.</p></details> |  |
| **[FASTGEN: Fast and Cost-Effective Synthetic Tabular Data Generation with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.15839v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Synthetic data generation has emerged as an invaluable solution in scenarios where real-world data collection and usage are limited by cost and scarcity. Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in producing high-fidelity, domain-relevant samples across various fields. However, existing approaches that directly use LLMs to generate each record individually impose prohibitive time and cost burdens, particularly when large volumes of synthetic data are required. In this work, we propose a fast, cost-effective method for realistic tabular data synthesis that leverages LLMs to infer and encode each field's distribution into a reusable sampling script. By automatically classifying fields into numerical, categorical, or free-text types, the LLM generates distribution-based scripts that can efficiently produce diverse, realistic datasets at scale without continuous model inference. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms traditional direct methods in both diversity and data realism, substantially reducing the burden of high-volume synthetic data generation. We plan to apply this methodology to accelerate testing in production pipelines, thereby shortening development cycles and improving overall system efficiency. We believe our insights and lessons learned will aid researchers and practitioners seeking scalable, cost-effective solutions for synthetic data generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[STRuCT-LLM: Unifying Tabular and Graph Reasoning with Reinforcement Learning for Semantic Parsing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.21575v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose STRuCT-LLM, a unified framework for training large language models (LLMs) to perform structured reasoning over both relational and graph-structured data. Our approach jointly optimizes Text-to-SQL and Text-to-Cypher tasks using reinforcement learning (RL) combined with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) supervision. To support fine-grained optimization in graph-based parsing, we introduce a topology-aware reward function based on graph edit distance. Unlike prior work that treats relational and graph formalisms in isolation, STRuCT-LLM leverages shared abstractions between SQL and Cypher to induce cross-formalism transfer, enabling SQL training to improve Cypher performance and vice versa - even without shared schemas. Our largest model (QwQ-32B) achieves substantial relative improvements across tasks: on semantic parsing, Spider improves by 13.5\% and Text2Cypher by 73.1\%. The model also demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization, improving performance on downstream tabular QA (TableBench: 8.5\%) and knowledge graph QA (CR-LT-KGQA: 1.7\%) without any QA-specific supervision. These results demonstrate both the effectiveness of executable queries as scaffolds for structured reasoning and the synergistic benefits of jointly training on SQL and Cypher (code available at https://github.com/bouv/STRuCT-LLM).</p></details> |  |
| **[Simulating Tabular Datasets through LLMs to Rapidly Explore Hypotheses about Real-World Entities](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.18071v1)** | 2024-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Do horror writers have worse childhoods than other writers? Though biographical details are known about many writers, quantitatively exploring such a qualitative hypothesis requires significant human effort, e.g. to sift through many biographies and interviews of writers and to iteratively search for quantitative features that reflect what is qualitatively of interest. This paper explores the potential to quickly prototype these kinds of hypotheses through (1) applying LLMs to estimate properties of concrete entities like specific people, companies, books, kinds of animals, and countries; (2) performing off-the-shelf analysis methods to reveal possible relationships among such properties (e.g. linear regression); and towards further automation, (3) applying LLMs to suggest the quantitative properties themselves that could help ground a particular qualitative hypothesis (e.g. number of adverse childhood events, in the context of the running example). The hope is to allow sifting through hypotheses more quickly through collaboration between human and machine. Our experiments highlight that indeed, LLMs can serve as useful estimators of tabular data about specific entities across a range of domains, and that such estimations improve with model scale. Further, initial experiments demonstrate the potential of LLMs to map a qualitative hypothesis of interest to relevant concrete variables that the LLM can then estimate. The conclusion is that LLMs offer intriguing potential to help illuminate scientifically interesting patterns latent within the internet-scale data they are trained upon.</p></details> |  |
| **[Measuring LLM Sensitivity in Transformer-based Tabular Data Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.20768v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Synthetic tabular data is used for privacy-preserving data sharing and data-driven model development. Its effectiveness, however, depends heavily on the used Tabular Data Synthesis (TDS) tool. Recent studies have shown that Transformer-based models outperform other state-of-the-art models such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Diffusion models in terms of data quality. However, Transformer-based models also come with high computational costs, making them sometimes unfeasible for end users with prosumer hardware. This study presents a sensitivity assessment on how the choice of hyperparameters, such as number of layers or hidden dimension affects the quality of the resultant synthetic data and the computational performance. It is performed across two tools, GReaT and REaLTabFormer, evaluating 10 model setups that vary in architecture type and depth. We assess the sensitivity on three dimensions: runtime, machine learning (ML) utility, and similarity to real data distributions. Experiments were conducted on four real-world datasets. Our findings reveal that runtime is proportional to the number of hyperparameters, with shallower configurations completing faster. GReaT consistently achieves lower runtimes than REaLTabFormer, and only on the largest dataset they have comparable runtime. For small datasets, both tools achieve synthetic data with high utility and optimal similarity, but on larger datasets only REaLTabFormer sustains strong utility and similarity. As a result, REaLTabFormer with lightweight LLMs provides the best balance, since it preserves data quality while reducing computational requirements. Nonetheless, its runtime remains higher than that of GReaT and other TDS tools, suggesting that efficiency gains are possible but only up to a certain level.</p></details> | 12 pages, 7 figures |

Since the collection of high-quality TMWP datasets is costly and time-consuming, recent research has concentrated on automatic TMWP generation. However, current generated samples usually suffer from issues of either correctness or diversity. In this paper, we propose a Template-driven LLM-paraphrased (TeLL) framework for generating high-quality TMWP samples with diverse backgrounds and accurate tables, questions, answers, and solutions. To this end, we first extract templates from existing real samples to generate initial problems, ensuring correctness. Then, we adopt an LLM to extend templates and paraphrase problems, obtaining diverse TMWP samples. Furthermore, we find the reasoning annotation is important for solving TMWPs. Therefore, we propose to enrich each solution with illustrative reasoning steps. Through the proposed framework, we construct a high-quality dataset TabMWP-TeLL by adhering to the question types in the TabMWP dataset, and we conduct extensive experiments on a variety of LLMs to demonstrate the effectiveness of TabMWP-TeLL in improving TMWP solving performance.

| **[Pneuma: Leveraging LLMs for Tabular Data Representation and Retrieval in an End-to-End System](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.09207v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Finding relevant tables among databases, lakes, and repositories is the first step in extracting value from data. Such a task remains difficult because assessing whether a table is relevant to a problem does not always depend only on its content but also on the context, which is usually tribal knowledge known to the individual or team. While tools like data catalogs and academic data discovery systems target this problem, they rely on keyword search or more complex interfaces, limiting non-technical users' ability to find relevant data. The advent of large language models (LLMs) offers a unique opportunity for users to ask questions directly in natural language, making dataset discovery more intuitive, accessible, and efficient. In this paper, we introduce Pneuma, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system designed to efficiently and effectively discover tabular data. Pneuma leverages large language models (LLMs) for both table representation and table retrieval. For table representation, Pneuma preserves schema and row-level information to ensure comprehensive data understanding. For table retrieval, Pneuma augments LLMs with traditional information retrieval techniques, such as full-text and vector search, harnessing the strengths of both to improve retrieval performance. To evaluate Pneuma, we generate comprehensive benchmarks that simulate table discovery workload on six real-world datasets including enterprise data, scientific databases, warehousing data, and open data. Our results demonstrate that Pneuma outperforms widely used table search systems (such as full-text search and state-of-the-art RAG systems) in accuracy and resource efficiency.</p></details> | SIGMOD 2025 Paper |

However, access to such data is often limited by patient privacy concerns, data sharing restrictions and high costs. To overcome these limitations, synthetic patient data has emerged as an alternative. However, synthetic data generation (SDG) methods typically rely on machine learning (ML) models trained on original data, leading back to the data scarcity problem. We propose an approach to generate synthetic tabular patient data that does not require access to the original data, but only a description of the desired database. We leverage prior medical knowledge and in-context learning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to generate realistic patient data, even in a low-resource setting. We quantitatively evaluate our approach against state-of-the-art SDG models, using fidelity, privacy, and utility metrics. Our results show that while LLMs may not match the performance of state-of-the-art models trained on the original data, they effectively generate realistic patient data with well-preserved clinical correlations. An ablation study highlights key elements of our prompt contributing to high-quality synthetic patient data generation. This approach, which is easy to use and does not require original data or advanced ML skills, is particularly valuable for quickly generating custom-designed patient data, supporting project implementation and providing educational resources.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 3 figures.

| **[Pre-Hoc Predictions in AutoML: Leveraging LLMs to Enhance Model Selection and Benchmarking for Tabular datasets](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.01842v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The field of AutoML has made remarkable progress in post-hoc model selection, with libraries capable of automatically identifying the most performing models for a given dataset. Nevertheless, these methods often rely on exhaustive hyperparameter searches, where methods automatically train and test different types of models on the target dataset. Contrastingly, pre-hoc prediction emerges as a promising alternative, capable of bypassing exhaustive search through intelligent pre-selection of models. Despite its potential, pre-hoc prediction remains under-explored in the literature. This paper explores the intersection of AutoML and pre-hoc model selection by leveraging traditional models and Large Language Model (LLM) agents to reduce the search space of AutoML libraries. By relying on dataset descriptions and statistical information, we reduce the AutoML search space. Our methodology is applied to the AWS AutoGluon portfolio dataset, a state-of-the-art AutoML benchmark containing 175 tabular classification datasets available on OpenML. The proposed approach offers a shift in AutoML workflows, significantly reducing computational overhead, while still selecting the best model for the given dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Oral ...</summary><p>Oral Presentations ADAPT Annual Scientific Conference 2025</p></details> |
| **[TabuLa: Harnessing Language Models for Tabular Data Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.12746v3)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tabular data synthesis is crucial for addressing privacy and security concerns in industries reliant on tabular data. While recent advancements adopt large language models (LLMs) for realistic tabular data generation, their long training times and limited reusability hinder practical applications. In this paper, we propose Tabula, a tabular data synthesizer that leverages the structure of LLM. Unlike state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLM-based tabular data synthesizers that rely on pre-trained LLMs, Tabula discards the pre-trained weights originally designed for natural language tasks, focusing instead on a tailored approach for tabular data. In addition, Tabula introduces a token sequence compression strategy that significantly reduces training time while maintaining data quality, alongside a novel token padding method that improves sequence alignment across training batches. Experiments on six datasets show that Tabula achieves superior synthetic data utility compared to current SOTA methods. Additionally, the results demonstrate that Tabula model trained on tabular datasets serves effectively as a foundational model for synthesizing new tabular datasets. Furthermore, the proposed padding method outperforms the conventional left and right padding strategies. Finally, the results highlight that Tabula averagely reduces training time per epoch by 46.2% compared to state-of-the-art LLM approaches while achieving higher data utility.

| **[Scalable In-Context Learning on Tabular Data via Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.03147v1)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have shown that large language models (LLMs), when customized with post-training on tabular data, can acquire general tabular in-context learning (TabICL) capabilities. These models are able to transfer effectively across diverse data schemas and different task domains. However, existing LLM-based TabICL approaches are constrained to few-shot scenarios due to the sequence length limitations of LLMs, as tabular instances represented in plain text consume substantial tokens. To address this limitation and enable scalable TabICL for any data size, we propose retrieval-augmented LLMs tailored to tabular data. Our approach incorporates a customized retrieval module, combined with retrieval-guided instruction-tuning for LLMs. This enables LLMs to effectively leverage larger datasets, achieving significantly improved performance across 69 widely recognized datasets and demonstrating promising scaling behavior. Extensive comparisons with state-of-the-art tabular models reveal that, while LLM-based TabICL still lags behind well-tuned numeric models in overall performance, it uncovers powerful algorithms under limited contexts, enhances ensemble diversity, and excels on specific datasets. These unique properties underscore the potential of language as a universal and accessible interface for scalable tabular data learning.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Elephants Never Forget: Memorization and Learning of Tabular Data in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.06209v3)** | 2024-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While many have shown how Large Language Models (LLMs) can be applied to a diverse set of tasks, the critical issues of data contamination and memorization are often glossed over. In this work, we address this concern for tabular data. Specifically, we introduce a variety of different techniques to assess whether a language model has seen a tabular dataset during training. This investigation reveals that LLMs have memorized many popular tabular datasets verbatim. We then compare the few-shot learning performance of LLMs on datasets that were seen during training to the performance on datasets released after training. We find that LLMs perform better on datasets seen during training, indicating that memorization leads to overfitting. At the same time, LLMs show non-trivial performance on novel datasets and are surprisingly robust to data transformations. We then investigate the in-context statistical learning abilities of LLMs. While LLMs are significantly better than random at solving statistical classification problems, the sample efficiency of few-shot learning lags behind traditional statistical learning algorithms, especially as the dimension of the problem increases. This suggests that much of the observed few-shot performance on novel real-world datasets is due to the LLM's world knowledge. Overall, our results highlight the importance of testing whether an LLM has seen an evaluation dataset during pre-training. We release the https://github.com/interpretml/LLM-Tabular-Memorization-Checker Python package to test LLMs for memorization of tabular datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>COLM ...</summary><p>COLM camera ready, fix typo</p></details> |

These are challenges that current tabular deep learning approaches have not fully tackled. Here we introduce Generative Tabular Learning (GTL), a novel framework that integrates the advanced functionalities of large language models (LLMs)-such as prompt-based zero-shot generalization and in-context learning-into tabular deep learning. GTL capitalizes on the pre-training of LLMs on diverse tabular data, enhancing their understanding of domain-specific knowledge, numerical sequences, and statistical dependencies critical for accurate predictions. Our empirical study spans 384 public datasets, rigorously analyzing GTL's convergence and scaling behaviors and assessing the impact of varied data templates. The GTL-enhanced LLaMA-2 model demonstrates superior zero-shot and in-context learning capabilities across numerous classification and regression tasks. Notably, it achieves this without fine-tuning, outperforming traditional methods and rivaling state-of-the-art models like GPT-4 in certain cases. Through GTL, we not only foster a deeper integration of LLMs' sophisticated abilities into tabular data comprehension and application but also offer a new training resource and a test bed for LLMs to enhance their ability to comprehend tabular data. To facilitate reproducible research, we release our code, data, and model checkpoints at https://github.com/microsoft/Industrial-Foundation-Models.</p></details> | Accepted by KDD 2024 |
| **[Chain-of-Table: Evolving Tables in the Reasoning Chain for Table Understanding](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.04398v2)** | 2024-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Table-based reasoning with large language models (LLMs) is a promising direction to tackle many table understanding tasks, such as table-based question answering and fact verification. Compared with generic reasoning, table-based reasoning requires the extraction of underlying semantics from both free-form questions and semi-structured tabular data. Chain-of-Thought and its similar approaches incorporate the reasoning chain in the form of textual context, but it is still an open question how to effectively leverage tabular data in the reasoning chain. We propose the Chain-of-Table framework, where tabular data is explicitly used in the reasoning chain as a proxy for intermediate thoughts. Specifically, we guide LLMs using in-context learning to iteratively generate operations and update the table to represent a tabular reasoning chain. LLMs can therefore dynamically plan the next operation based on the results of the previous ones. This continuous evolution of the table forms a chain, showing the reasoning process for a given tabular problem. The chain carries structured information of the intermediate results, enabling more accurate and reliable predictions. Chain-of-Table achieves new state-of-the-art performance on WikiTQ, FeTaQA, and TabFact benchmarks across multiple LLM choices.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2024</p></details> |

Our methodology can successfully annotate a large amount of tabular data and can be flexibly steered to generate various types of annotations based on specific research objectives, as we demonstrate with SQL annotation and input-target column annotation as examples. As a result, we release AnnotatedTables, a collection of 32,119 databases with LLM-generated annotations. The dataset includes 405,616 valid SQL programs, making it the largest SQL dataset with associated tabular data that supports query execution. To further demonstrate the value of our methodology and dataset, we perform two follow-up research studies. 1) We investigate whether LLMs can translate SQL programs to Rel programs, a database language previously unknown to LLMs, while obtaining the same execution results. Using our Incremental Prompt Engineering methods based on execution feedback, we show that LLMs can produce adequate translations with few-shot learning. 2) We evaluate the performance of TabPFN, a recent neural tabular classifier trained on Bayesian priors, on 2,720 tables with input-target columns identified and annotated by LLMs. On average, TabPFN performs on par with the baseline AutoML method, though the relative performance can vary significantly from one data table to another, making both models viable for practical applications depending on the situation. Our findings underscore the potential of LLMs in automating the annotation of large volumes of diverse tabular data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Transfer Learning of Tabular Data by Finetuning Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.06863v1)** | 2025-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution, deep learning has yet to achieve much success with tabular data due to heterogeneous feature space and limited sample sizes without viable transfer learning. The new era of generative AI, powered by large language models (LLM), brings unprecedented learning opportunities to diverse data and domains. This paper investigates the effectiveness of an LLM application programming interface (API) and transfer learning of LLM in tabular data classification. LLM APIs respond to input text prompts with tokenized data and instructions, whereas transfer learning finetunes an LLM for a target classification task. This paper proposes an end-to-end finetuning of LLM to demonstrate cross-data transfer learning on ten benchmark data sets when large pre-trained tabular data models do not exist to facilitate transfer learning. The proposed LLM finetuning method outperforms state-of-the-art machine and deep learning methods on tabular data with less than ten features - a standard feature size for tabular data sets. The transfer learning approach uses a fraction of the computational cost of other deep learning or API-based solutions while ensuring competitive or superior classification performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Interpretable Medical Diagnostics with Structured Data Extraction by Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.05052v1)** | 2023-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tabular data is often hidden in text, particularly in medical diagnostic reports. Traditional machine learning (ML) models designed to work with tabular data, cannot effectively process information in such form. On the other hand, large language models (LLMs) which excel at textual tasks, are probably not the best tool for modeling tabular data. Therefore, we propose a novel, simple, and effective methodology for extracting structured tabular data from textual medical reports, called TEMED-LLM. Drawing upon the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, TEMED-LLM goes beyond traditional extraction techniques, accurately inferring tabular features, even when their names are not explicitly mentioned in the text. This is achieved by combining domain-specific reasoning guidelines with a proposed data validation and reasoning correction feedback loop. By applying interpretable ML models such as decision trees and logistic regression over the extracted and validated data, we obtain end-to-end interpretable predictions. We demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art text classification models in medical diagnostics. Given its predictive performance, simplicity, and interpretability, TEMED-LLM underscores the potential of leveraging LLMs to improve the performance and trustworthiness of ML models in medical applications.</p></details> |  |

However, separating numerical and categorical data has limited the effectiveness of tabular data generation. The GReaT (Generate Realistic Tabular Data) framework uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to encode entire rows, eliminating the need to partition data types. Despite this, the framework's performance is constrained by two issues: (1) tabular data entries lack sufficient semantic meaning, limiting LLM's ability to leverage pre-trained knowledge for in-context learning, and (2) complex multi-table datasets struggle to establish effective relationships for collaboration. To address these, we propose GReaTER (Generate Realistic Tabular Data after data Enhancement and Reduction), which includes: (1) a data semantic enhancement system that improves LLM's understanding of tabular data through mapping, enabling better in-context learning, and (2) a cross-table connecting method to establish efficient relationships across complex tables. Experimental results show that GReaTER outperforms the GReaT framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Data Engineering Meets Large Language Models: Challenges and Opportunities Workshop@ICDE2025 Workshop at ICDE 2025</p></details> |

Current tabular learning research predominantly focuses on closed environments, while in real-world applications, open environments are often encountered, where distribution and feature shifts occur, leading to significant degradation in model performance. Previous research has primarily concentrated on mitigating distribution shifts, whereas feature shifts, a distinctive and unexplored challenge of tabular data, have garnered limited attention. To this end, this paper conducts the first comprehensive study on feature shifts in tabular data and introduces the first tabular feature-shift benchmark (TabFSBench). TabFSBench evaluates impacts of four distinct feature-shift scenarios on four tabular model categories across various datasets and assesses the performance of large language models (LLMs) and tabular LLMs in the tabular benchmark for the first time. Our study demonstrates three main observations: (1) most tabular models have the limited applicability in feature-shift scenarios; (2) the shifted feature set importance has a linear relationship with model performance degradation; (3) model performance in closed environments correlates with feature-shift performance. Future research direction is also explored for each observation. Benchmark: https://github.com/LAMDASZ-ML/TabFSBench.</p></details> |  |

Our findings demonstrate that our method significantly improves evidence-based reasoning across various models.

Providing natural language instructions to large language models (LLMs) offers an alternative solution. However, it is unclear how effectively instructions leverage the knowledge in LLMs for solving tabular prediction problems. To address this gap, we introduce TABLET, a benchmark of 20 diverse tabular datasets annotated with instructions that vary in their phrasing, granularity, and technicality. Additionally, TABLET includes the instructions' logic and structured modifications to the instructions. We find in-context instructions increase zero-shot F1 performance for Flan-T5 11b by 44% on average and 13% for ChatGPT on TABLET. Also, we explore the limitations of using LLMs for tabular prediction in our benchmark by evaluating instruction faithfulness. We find LLMs often ignore instructions and fail to predict specific instances correctly, even with examples. Our analysis on TABLET shows that, while instructions help LLM performance, learning from instructions for tabular data requires new capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Pleas...</summary><p>Please find the TABLET demo and code at https://dylanslacks.website/Tablet</p></details> |

However, directly applying parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques to tabular tasks presents significant challenges, particularly in terms of better table serialization and the representation of two-dimensional structured information within a one-dimensional sequence. To address this, we propose TableLoRA, a module designed to improve LLMs' understanding of table structure during PEFT. It incorporates special tokens for serializing tables with special token encoder and uses 2D LoRA to encode low-rank information on cell positions. Experiments on four tabular-related datasets demonstrate that TableLoRA consistently outperforms vanilla LoRA and surpasses various table encoding methods tested in control experiments.

These models make up for small training datasets by pretraining on large volumes of synthetic data. The prior knowledge obtained via pretraining provides the exceptional performance, but the resulting model becomes a black box that is difficult to interpret and costly to inference. In this work, we explore an alternative strategy: using reasoning-capable LLMs to induce decision trees for small tabular datasets in agentic setup. We design a minimal set of tools for constructing, analyzing and manipulating decision trees. By using these tools, LLMs combine their prior knowledge with learning from data to create a lightweight decision tree that outperforms traditional CART on low-resource tabular problems. While a single decision tree does not outperform state-of-the-art black box models, it comes with a human-readable reasoning trace that can be checked for biases and data leaks. Furthermore, the reasoning-based LLM's creation process allows for additional human input: correcting biases or incorporating domain-specific intuition that is not captured in the data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint, code at https://github.com/yandex-research/TalkingTrees</p></details> |

This research endeavors to apply Large Language Models (LLMs) towards addressing these predictive tasks. Despite their proficiency in comprehending natural language, LLMs fall short in dealing with structured tabular data. This limitation stems from their lacking exposure to the intricacies of tabular data during their foundational training. Our research aims to mitigate this gap by compiling a comprehensive corpus of tables annotated with instructions and executing large-scale training of Llama-2 on this enriched dataset. Furthermore, we investigate the practical application of applying the trained model to zero-shot prediction, few-shot prediction, and in-context learning scenarios. Through extensive experiments, our methodology has shown significant improvements over existing benchmarks. These advancements highlight the efficacy of tailoring LLM training to solve table-related problems in data science, thereby establishing a new benchmark in the utilization of LLMs for enhancing tabular intelligence.</p></details> | 10 pages |

However, inherent historical biases in tabular datasets often cause LLMs to exacerbate fairness issues, particularly when multiple advantaged and protected features are involved. In this work, we introduce a universal debiasing framework that minimizes group-level dependencies by simultaneously reducing the mutual information between advantaged and protected attributes. By leveraging the autoregressive structure and analytic sampling distributions of LLM-based tabular data generators, our approach efficiently computes mutual information, reducing the need for cumbersome numerical estimations. Building on this foundation, we propose two complementary methods: a direct preference optimization (DPO)-based strategy, namely UDF-DPO, that integrates seamlessly with existing models, and a targeted debiasing technique, namely UDF-MIX, that achieves debiasing without tuning the parameters of LLMs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework effectively balances fairness and utility, offering a scalable and practical solution for debiasing in high-stakes applications.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 Findings |

Although LLMs are observed to be vulnerable against prompt injection attacks from external data sources, tabular agents impose strict data formats and predefined rules on the attacker's payload, which are ineffective unless the agent navigates multiple layers of structural data to incorporate the payload. To address the challenge, we present a novel attack termed StruPhantom which specifically targets black-box LLM-powered tabular agents. Our attack designs an evolutionary optimization procedure which continually refines attack payloads via the proposed constrained Monte Carlo Tree Search augmented by an off-topic evaluator. StruPhantom helps systematically explore and exploit the weaknesses of target applications to achieve goal hijacking. Our evaluation validates the effectiveness of StruPhantom across various LLM-based agents, including those on real-world platforms, and attack scenarios. Our attack achieves over 50% higher success rates than baselines in enforcing the application's response to contain phishing links or malicious codes.</p></details> | Work in Progress |

However, existing long-context benchmarks like Needle-in-a-Haystack primarily focus on unstructured text, neglecting the challenge of diverse structured tables. Meanwhile, previous tabular benchmarks mainly consider downstream tasks that require high-level reasoning abilities, and overlook models' underlying fine-grained perception of individual table cells, which is crucial for practical and robust LLM-based table applications. To address this gap, we introduce \textsc{NeedleInATable} (NIAT), a new long-context tabular benchmark that treats each table cell as a ``needle'' and requires models to extract the target cell based on cell locations or lookup questions. Our comprehensive evaluation of various LLMs and multimodal LLMs reveals a substantial performance gap between popular downstream tabular tasks and the simpler NIAT task, suggesting that they may rely on dataset-specific correlations or shortcuts to obtain better benchmark results but lack truly robust long-context understanding towards structured tables. Furthermore, we demonstrate that using synthesized NIAT training data can effectively improve performance on both NIAT task and downstream tabular tasks, which validates the importance of NIAT capability for LLMs' genuine table understanding ability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

Contemporary methodologies in generating tabular data revolve around utilizing Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) or fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLM). However, GAN-based approaches are documented to produce samples with common-sense errors attributed to the absence of external knowledge. On the other hand, LLM-based methods exhibit a limited capacity to capture the disparities between synthesized and actual data distribution due to the absence of feedback from a discriminator during training. Furthermore, the decoding of LLM-based generation introduces gradient breakpoints, impeding the backpropagation of loss from a discriminator, thereby complicating the integration of these two approaches. To solve this challenge, we propose using proximal policy optimization (PPO) to apply GANs, guiding LLMs to enhance the probability distribution of tabular features. This approach enables the utilization of LLMs as generators for GANs in synthesizing tabular data. Our experiments demonstrate that PPO leads to an approximately 4\% improvement in the accuracy of models trained on synthetically generated data over state-of-the-art across three real-world datasets.</p></details> |  |

Using the large language model (LLM) GPT-4o and plain-language prompting, we demonstrate the ability to generate high-fidelity tabular data without task-specific fine-tuning or access to real-world data (RWD) for pre-training. To benchmark GPT-4o, we compared the fidelity and privacy of LLM-generated synthetic data against data generated with the conditional tabular generative adversarial network (CTGAN), across three open-access datasets: Iris, Fish Measurements, and Real Estate Valuation. Despite the zero-shot approach, GPT-4o outperformed CTGAN in preserving means, 95% confidence intervals, bivariate correlations, and data privacy of RWD, even at amplified sample sizes. Notably, correlations between parameters were consistently preserved with appropriate direction and strength. However, refinement is necessary to better retain distributional characteristics. These findings highlight the potential of LLMs in tabular data synthesis, offering an accessible alternative to generative adversarial networks and variational autoencoders.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 7 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

| **[TabGen-ICL: Residual-Aware In-Context Example Selection for Tabular Data Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.16414v1)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language models (LLMs) have achieved encouraging results in tabular data generation. However, existing approaches require fine-tuning, which is computationally expensive. This paper explores an alternative: prompting a fixed LLM with in-context examples. We observe that using randomly selected in-context examples hampers the LLM's performance, resulting in sub-optimal generation quality. To address this, we propose a novel in-context learning framework: TabGen-ICL, to enhance the in-context learning ability of LLMs for tabular data generation. TabGen-ICL operates iteratively, retrieving a subset of real samples that represent the residual between currently generated samples and true data distributions. This approach serves two purposes: locally, it provides more effective in-context learning examples for the LLM in each iteration; globally, it progressively narrows the gap between generated and real data. Extensive experiments on five real-world tabular datasets demonstrate that TabGen-ICL significantly outperforms the random selection strategy. Specifically, it reduces the error rate by a margin of $3.5\%-42.2\%$ on fidelity metrics. We demonstrate for the first time that prompting a fixed LLM can yield high-quality synthetic tabular data. The code is provided in the \href{https://github.com/fangliancheng/TabGEN-ICL}{link}.</p></details> |  |
| **[Elephants Never Forget: Testing Language Models for Memorization of Tabular Data](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.06644v1)** | 2024-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While many have shown how Large Language Models (LLMs) can be applied to a diverse set of tasks, the critical issues of data contamination and memorization are often glossed over. In this work, we address this concern for tabular data. Starting with simple qualitative tests for whether an LLM knows the names and values of features, we introduce a variety of different techniques to assess the degrees of contamination, including statistical tests for conditional distribution modeling and four tests that identify memorization. Our investigation reveals that LLMs are pre-trained on many popular tabular datasets. This exposure can lead to invalid performance evaluation on downstream tasks because the LLMs have, in effect, been fit to the test set. Interestingly, we also identify a regime where the language model reproduces important statistics of the data, but fails to reproduce the dataset verbatim. On these datasets, although seen during training, good performance on downstream tasks might not be due to overfitting. Our findings underscore the need for ensuring data integrity in machine learning tasks with LLMs. To facilitate future research, we release an open-source tool that can perform various tests for memorization \url{https://github.com/interpretml/LLM-Tabular-Memorization-Checker}.</p></details> | <details><summary>Table...</summary><p>Table Representation Learning Workshop at NeurIPS 2023</p></details> |

Currently, using Large Language Models (LLMs) is the predominant method for table reasoning. Most existing methods employ a fixed tabular format to represent the table, which could limit the performance. Given that each instance requires different capabilities and models possess varying abilities, we assert that different instances and models suit different tabular formats. We prove the aforementioned claim through quantitative analysis of experimental results, where different instances and models achieve different performances using various tabular formats. Building on this discussion, we propose FLEXTAF-Single and FLEXTAF-Vote to enhance table reasoning performance by employing flexible tabular formats. Specifically, (i) FLEXTAF-Single trains a classifier to predict the most suitable tabular format based on the instance and the LLM. (ii) FLEXTAF-Vote integrates the results across different formats. Our experiments on WikiTableQuestions and TabFact reveal significant improvements, with average gains of 2.3% and 4.8% compared to the best performance achieved using a fixed tabular format with greedy decoding and self-consistency decoding, thereby validating the effectiveness of our methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Differentially Private Tabular Data Synthesis using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.01457v1)** | 2024-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Synthetic tabular data generation with differential privacy is a crucial problem to enable data sharing with formal privacy. Despite a rich history of methodological research and development, developing differentially private tabular data generators that can provide realistic synthetic datasets remains challenging. This paper introduces DP-LLMTGen -- a novel framework for differentially private tabular data synthesis that leverages pretrained large language models (LLMs). DP-LLMTGen models sensitive datasets using a two-stage fine-tuning procedure with a novel loss function specifically designed for tabular data. Subsequently, it generates synthetic data through sampling the fine-tuned LLMs. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that DP-LLMTGen outperforms a variety of existing mechanisms across multiple datasets and privacy settings. Additionally, we conduct an ablation study and several experimental analyses to deepen our understanding of LLMs in addressing this important problem. Finally, we highlight the controllable generation ability of DP-LLMTGen through a fairness-constrained generation setting.</p></details> |  |
| **[UniPredict: Large Language Models are Universal Tabular Classifiers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.03266v2)** | 2024-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tabular data prediction is a fundamental machine learning task for many applications. Existing methods predominantly employ discriminative modeling and operate under the assumption of a fixed target column, necessitating re-training for every new predictive task. Inspired by the generative power of large language models (LLMs), this paper exploits the idea of building universal tabular data predictors based on generative modeling, namely UniPredict. Here, we demonstrate the scalability of an LLM to extensive tabular datasets, enabling it to comprehend diverse tabular inputs and predict target variables following the provided instructions. Specifically, we train a single LLM on an aggregation of 169 tabular datasets with diverse targets and compare its performance against baselines that are trained on each dataset separately. We observe this versatile UniPredict model demonstrates an advantage over other models, ranging from 5.4% to 13.4%, when compared with the best tree-boosting baseline and the best neural network baseline, respectively. We further test UniPredict in few-shot learning settings on another 62 tabular datasets. Our method achieves strong performance in quickly adapting to new tasks. In low-resource few-shot setup, we observed a 100%+ performance advantage compared with XGBoost, and significant margin over all baselines. We envision that UniPredict sheds light on developing a universal tabular data prediction system that learns from data at scale and serves a wide range of prediction tasks.</p></details> |  |

Recently, ICL has been extended to allow tabular data to be used as demonstration examples by serializing individual records into natural language formats. However, it has been shown that LLMs can leak information contained in prompts, and since tabular data often contain sensitive information, understanding how to protect the underlying tabular data used in ICL is a critical area of research. This work serves as an initial investigation into how to use differential privacy (DP) -- the long-established gold standard for data privacy and anonymization -- to protect tabular data used in ICL. Specifically, we investigate the application of DP mechanisms for private tabular ICL via data privatization prior to serialization and prompting. We formulate two private ICL frameworks with provable privacy guarantees in both the local (LDP-TabICL) and global (GDP-TabICL) DP scenarios via injecting noise into individual records or group statistics, respectively. We evaluate our DP-based frameworks on eight real-world tabular datasets and across multiple ICL and DP settings. Our evaluations show that DP-based ICL can protect the privacy of the underlying tabular data while achieving comparable performance to non-LLM baselines, especially under high privacy regimes.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 2 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |

The performance of tabular models--such as gradient boosted decision trees and neural networks--can vary significantly across datasets due to differences in feature distributions and task characteristics. Achieving top performance on each dataset often requires specialized expert knowledge. To address this variability, practitioners often aggregate the predictions of multiple models. However, conventional aggregation strategies typically rely on static combination rules and lack instance-level adaptability. In this work, we propose an in-context ensemble framework for tabular prediction that leverages large language models (LLMs) to perform dynamic, instance-specific integration of external model predictions. Without access to raw tabular features or semantic information, our method constructs a context around each test instance using its nearest neighbors and the predictions from a pool of external models. Within this enriched context, we introduce Chain of Tabular Thoughts (CoT$^2$), a prompting strategy that guides LLMs through multi-step, interpretable reasoning, making still further progress toward expert-level decision-making. Experimental results show that our method outperforms well-tuned baselines and standard ensemble techniques across a wide range of tabular datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Models Can Automatically Engineer Features for Few-Shot Tabular Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.09491v2)** | 2024-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs), with their remarkable ability to tackle challenging and unseen reasoning problems, hold immense potential for tabular learning, that is vital for many real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a novel in-context learning framework, FeatLLM, which employs LLMs as feature engineers to produce an input data set that is optimally suited for tabular predictions. The generated features are used to infer class likelihood with a simple downstream machine learning model, such as linear regression and yields high performance few-shot learning. The proposed FeatLLM framework only uses this simple predictive model with the discovered features at inference time. Compared to existing LLM-based approaches, FeatLLM eliminates the need to send queries to the LLM for each sample at inference time. Moreover, it merely requires API-level access to LLMs, and overcomes prompt size limitations. As demonstrated across numerous tabular datasets from a wide range of domains, FeatLLM generates high-quality rules, significantly (10% on average) outperforming alternatives such as TabLLM and STUNT.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICML, 2024</p></details> |

Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been used to automatically generate new features by leveraging their vast knowledge. However, existing LLM-based approaches often produce overly simple or repetitive features, partly due to inherent biases in the transformations the LLM chooses and the lack of structured reasoning guidance during generation. In this paper, we propose a novel method REFeat, which guides an LLM to discover diverse and informative features by leveraging multiple types of reasoning to steer the feature generation process. Experiments on 59 benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach not only achieves higher predictive accuracy on average, but also discovers more diverse and meaningful features. These results highlight the promise of incorporating rich reasoning paradigms and adaptive strategy selection into LLM-driven feature discovery for tabular data.</p></details> |  |

Evaluating LLM Fairness and Performance in Loan Approval across Table-to-Text Serialization Approaches](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.21512v1)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed in high-stakes decision-making tasks, such as loan approvals. While their applications expand across domains, LLMs struggle to process tabular data, ensuring fairness and delivering reliable predictions. In this work, we assess the performance and fairness of LLMs on serialized loan approval datasets from three geographically distinct regions: Ghana, Germany, and the United States. Our evaluation focuses on the model's zero-shot and in-context learning (ICL) capabilities. Our results reveal that the choice of serialization (Serialization refers to the process of converting tabular data into text formats suitable for processing by LLMs.) format significantly affects both performance and fairness in LLMs, with certain formats such as GReat and LIFT yielding higher F1 scores but exacerbating fairness disparities. Notably, while ICL improved model performance by 4.9-59.6% relative to zero-shot baselines, its effect on fairness varied considerably across datasets. Our work underscores the importance of effective tabular data representation methods and fairness-aware models to improve the reliability of LLMs in financial decision-making.</p></details> |  |

Accurate extraction and precise calculation from tabular data are essential for reliable financial analysis, since even minor numerical errors can undermine decision-making and regulatory compliance. Financial applications have unique requirements, often relying on context-dependent, numerical, and proprietary tabular data that existing hallucination benchmarks rarely capture. In this study, we develop a rigorous and scalable framework for evaluating intrinsic hallucinations in financial LLMs, conceptualized as a context-aware masked span prediction task over real-world financial documents. Our main contributions are: (1) a novel, automated dataset creation paradigm using a masking strategy; (2) a new hallucination evaluation dataset derived from S&P 500 annual reports; and (3) a comprehensive evaluation of intrinsic hallucination patterns in state-of-the-art LLMs on financial tabular data. Our work provides a robust methodology for in-house LLM evaluation and serves as a critical step toward building more trustworthy and reliable financial Generative AI systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, AMC ICAIF'25</p></details> |

However, the generation of synthetic samples with the original data's characteristics remains a significant challenge for tabular data. While many generative models from the computer vision domain, such as variational autoencoders or generative adversarial networks, have been adapted for tabular data generation, less research has been directed towards recent transformer-based large language models (LLMs), which are also generative in nature. To this end, we propose GReaT (Generation of Realistic Tabular data), which exploits an auto-regressive generative LLM to sample synthetic and yet highly realistic tabular data. Furthermore, GReaT can model tabular data distributions by conditioning on any subset of features; the remaining features are sampled without additional overhead. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in a series of experiments that quantify the validity and quality of the produced data samples from multiple angles. We find that GReaT maintains state-of-the-art performance across numerous real-world and synthetic data sets with heterogeneous feature types coming in various sizes.</p></details> |  |

Existing solutions mainly tested on smaller tables face scalability issues and struggle with complex queries due to incomplete or dispersed data across different table sections. To alleviate these challenges, we propose TAP4LLM as a versatile pre-processor suite for leveraging LLMs in table-based tasks effectively. It covers several distinct components: (1) table sampling to decompose large tables into manageable sub-tables based on query semantics, (2) table augmentation to enhance tables with additional knowledge from external sources or models, and (3) table packing & serialization to convert tables into various formats suitable for LLMs' understanding. In each module, we design and compare several common methods under various usage scenarios, aiming to shed light on the best practices for leveraging LLMs for table-reasoning tasks. Our experiments show that our method improves LLMs' reasoning capabilities in various tabular tasks and enhances the interaction between LLMs and tabular data by employing effective pre-processing.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by EMNLP 2024</p></details> |

Recently, pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) -- even those at the scale of GPT-2 -- have demonstrated great potential in synthesizing tabular data. However, their applications under DP constraints remain largely unexplored. In this work, we address this gap by applying DP techniques to the generation of synthetic tabular data. Our findings shows that LLMs face difficulties in generating coherent text when fine-tuned with DP, as privacy budgets are inefficiently allocated to non-private elements like table structures. To overcome this, we propose DP-2Stage, a two-stage fine-tuning framework for differentially private tabular data generation. The first stage involves non-private fine-tuning on a pseudo dataset, followed by DP fine-tuning on a private dataset. Our empirical results show that this approach improves performance across various settings and metrics compared to directly fine-tuned LLMs in DP contexts. We release our code and setup at https://github.com/tejuafonja/DP-2Stage.</p></details> |  |
