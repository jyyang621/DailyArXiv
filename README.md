| **[RAG-Anything: All-in-One RAG Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12323v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a fundamental paradigm for expanding Large Language Models beyond their static training limitations. However, a critical misalignment exists between current RAG capabilities and real-world information environments. Modern knowledge repositories are inherently multimodal, containing rich combinations of textual content, visual elements, structured tables, and mathematical expressions. Yet existing RAG frameworks are limited to textual content, creating fundamental gaps when processing multimodal documents. We present RAG-Anything, a unified framework that enables comprehensive knowledge retrieval across all modalities. Our approach reconceptualizes multimodal content as interconnected knowledge entities rather than isolated data types. The framework introduces dual-graph construction to capture both cross-modal relationships and textual semantics within a unified representation. We develop cross-modal hybrid retrieval that combines structural knowledge navigation with semantic matching. This enables effective reasoning over heterogeneous content where relevant evidence spans multiple modalities. RAG-Anything demonstrates superior performance on challenging multimodal benchmarks, achieving significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods. Performance gains become particularly pronounced on long documents where traditional approaches fail. Our framework establishes a new paradigm for multimodal knowledge access, eliminating the architectural fragmentation that constrains current systems. Our framework is open-sourced at: https://github.com/HKUDS/RAG-Anything.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beating Harmful Stereotypes Through Facts: RAG-based Counter-speech Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12316v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Counter-speech generation is at the core of many expert activities, such as fact-checking and hate speech, to counter harmful content. Yet, existing work treats counter-speech generation as pure text generation task, mainly based on Large Language Models or NGO experts. These approaches show severe drawbacks due to the limited reliability and coherence in the generated countering text, and in scalability, respectively. To close this gap, we introduce a novel framework to model counter-speech generation as knowledge-wise text generation process. Our framework integrates advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines to ensure the generation of trustworthy counter-speech for 8 main target groups identified in the hate speech literature, including women, people of colour, persons with disabilities, migrants, Muslims, Jews, LGBT persons, and other. We built a knowledge base over the United Nations Digital Library, EUR-Lex and the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights, comprising a total of 32,792 texts. We use the MultiTarget-CONAN dataset to empirically assess the quality of the generated counter-speech, both through standard metrics (i.e., JudgeLM) and a human evaluation. Results show that our framework outperforms standard LLM baselines and competitive approach, on both assessments. The resulting framework and the knowledge base pave the way for studying trustworthy and sound counter-speech generation, in hate speech and beyond.</p></details> |  |
| **[LUMINA: Detecting Hallucinations in RAG System with Context-Knowledge Signals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21875v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) aims to mitigate hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) by grounding responses in retrieved documents. Yet, RAG-based LLMs still hallucinate even when provided with correct and sufficient context. A growing line of work suggests that this stems from an imbalance between how models use external context and their internal knowledge, and several approaches have attempted to quantify these signals for hallucination detection. However, existing methods require extensive hyperparameter tuning, limiting their generalizability. We propose LUMINA, a novel framework that detects hallucinations in RAG systems through context-knowledge signals: external context utilization is quantified via distributional distance, while internal knowledge utilization is measured by tracking how predicted tokens evolve across transformer layers. We further introduce a framework for statistically validating these measurements. Experiments on common RAG hallucination benchmarks and four open-source LLMs show that LUMINA achieves consistently high AUROC and AUPRC scores, outperforming prior utilization-based methods by up to +13% AUROC on HalluRAG. Moreover, LUMINA remains robust under relaxed assumptions about retrieval quality and model matching, offering both effectiveness and practicality.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Longitudinal Study on Different Annotator Feedback Loops in Complex RAG Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11897v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Grounding conversations in existing passages, known as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), is an important aspect of Chat-Based Assistants powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) to ensure they are faithful and don't provide misinformation. Several benchmarks have been created to measure the performance of LLMs on this task. We present a longitudinal study comparing the feedback loop of an internal and external human annotator group for the complex annotation task of creating multi-turn RAG conversations for evaluating LLMs. We analyze the conversations produced by both groups and provide results of a survey comparing their experiences. Our study highlights the advantages of each annotator population and the impact of the different feedback loops; a closer loop creates higher quality conversations with a decrease in quantity and diversity. Further, we present guidance for how to best utilize two different population groups when performing annotation tasks, particularly when the task is complex.</p></details> | 26 pages |
| **[FinVet: A Collaborative Framework of RAG and External Fact-Checking Agents for Financial Misinformation Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11654v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Financial markets face growing threats from misinformation that can trigger billions in losses in minutes. Most existing approaches lack transparency in their decision-making and provide limited attribution to credible sources. We introduce FinVet, a novel multi-agent framework that integrates two Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines with external fact-checking through a confidence-weighted voting mechanism. FinVet employs adaptive three-tier processing that dynamically adjusts verification strategies based on retrieval confidence, from direct metadata extraction to hybrid reasoning to full model-based analysis. Unlike existing methods, FinVet provides evidence-backed verdicts, source attribution, confidence scores, and explicit uncertainty flags when evidence is insufficient. Experimental evaluation on the FinFact dataset shows that FinVet achieves an F1 score of 0.85, which is a 10.4% improvement over the best individual pipeline (fact-check pipeline) and 37% improvement over standalone RAG approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Domain-Specific Data Generation Framework for RAG Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11217v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) combines the language understanding and reasoning power of large language models (LLMs) with external retrieval to enable domain-grounded responses. Effectively adapting RAG systems to domain-specific settings requires specialized, context-rich training data beyond general-purpose question-answering. Here, we propose RAGen, a scalable and modular framework for generating domain-grounded question-answer-context (QAC) triples tailored to diverse RAG adaptation approaches. RAGen produces these QAC triples by identifying key concepts in documents, generating diverse questions guided by Bloom's Taxonomy-inspired principles, and pairing them with precise answers extracted from relevant contexts. RAGen supports multiple RAG adaptation strategies, including the optimization of key components such as the LLM, retriever, and embedding model, etc. Its modular pipeline features semantic chunking, hierarchical concept extraction, and multi-chunk retrieval, along with the introduction of curated distractor contexts to promote robust reasoning. Designed for scalability, RAGen efficiently handles large and evolving document corpora without redundant processing, making it especially suitable for dynamic evolving domains such as scientific research and enterprise knowledge bases.</p></details> |  |
| **[RAG-Pull: Imperceptible Attacks on RAG Systems for Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11195v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) increases the reliability and trustworthiness of the LLM response and reduces hallucination by eliminating the need for model retraining. It does so by adding external data into the LLM's context. We develop a new class of black-box attack, RAG-Pull, that inserts hidden UTF characters into queries or external code repositories, redirecting retrieval toward malicious code, thereby breaking the models' safety alignment. We observe that query and code perturbations alone can shift retrieval toward attacker-controlled snippets, while combined query-and-target perturbations achieve near-perfect success. Once retrieved, these snippets introduce exploitable vulnerabilities such as remote code execution and SQL injection. RAG-Pull's minimal perturbations can alter the model's safety alignment and increase preference towards unsafe code, therefore opening up a new class of attacks on LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Chronological Passage Assembling in RAG framework for Temporal Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18748v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-context question answering over narrative tasks is challenging because correct answers often hinge on reconstructing a coherent timeline of events while preserving contextual f low in a limited context window. Retrievalaugmented generation (RAG) methods aim to address this challenge by selectively retrieving only necessary document segments. However, narrative texts possess unique characteristics that limit the effectiveness of these existing approaches. Specifically, understanding narrative texts requires more than isolated segments, as the broader context and sequential relationships between segments are crucial for comprehension. To address these limitations, we propose ChronoRAG, a novel RAG framework specialized for narrative texts. This approach focuses on two essential aspects: refining dispersed document information into coherent and structured passages and preserving narrative flow by explicitly capturing and maintaining the temporal order among retrieved passages. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of ChronoRAG through experiments on the NarrativeQA and GutenQAdataset, showing substantial improvements in tasks requiring both factual identification and comprehension of complex sequential relationships, underscoring that reasoning over temporal order is crucial in resolving narrative QA.</p></details> | 15 pages, 4 figures |
| **[When Machine Unlearning Meets Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): Keep Secret or Forget Knowledge?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15267v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The deployment of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and Gemini has shown their powerful natural language generation capabilities. However, these models can inadvertently learn and retain sensitive information and harmful content during training, raising significant ethical and legal concerns. To address these issues, machine unlearning has been introduced as a potential solution. While existing unlearning methods take into account the specific characteristics of LLMs, they often suffer from high computational demands, limited applicability, or the risk of catastrophic forgetting. To address these limitations, we propose a lightweight behavioral unlearning framework based on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology. By modifying the external knowledge base of RAG, we simulate the effects of forgetting without directly interacting with the unlearned LLM. We approach the construction of unlearned knowledge as a constrained optimization problem, deriving two key components that underpin the effectiveness of RAG-based unlearning. This RAG-based approach is particularly effective for closed-source LLMs, where existing unlearning methods often fail. We evaluate our framework through extensive experiments on both open-source and closed-source models, including ChatGPT, Gemini, Llama-2-7b-chat, and PaLM 2. The results demonstrate that our approach meets five key unlearning criteria: effectiveness, universality, harmlessness, simplicity, and robustness. Meanwhile, this approach can extend to multimodal large language models and LLM-based agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 9 figures, 13 tables.

| **[VeritasFi: An Adaptable, Multi-tiered RAG Framework for Multi-modal Financial Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10828v1)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is becoming increasingly essential for Question Answering (QA) in the financial sector, where accurate and contextually grounded insights from complex public disclosures are crucial. However, existing financial RAG systems face two significant challenges: (1) they struggle to process heterogeneous data formats, such as text, tables, and figures; and (2) they encounter difficulties in balancing general-domain applicability with company-specific adaptation. To overcome these challenges, we present VeritasFi, an innovative hybrid RAG framework that incorporates a multi-modal preprocessing pipeline alongside a cutting-edge two-stage training strategy for its re-ranking component. VeritasFi enhances financial QA through three key innovations: (1) A multi-modal preprocessing pipeline that seamlessly transforms heterogeneous data into a coherent, machine-readable format. (2) A tripartite hybrid retrieval engine that operates in parallel, combining deep multi-path retrieval over a semantically indexed document corpus, real-time data acquisition through tool utilization, and an expert-curated memory bank for high-frequency questions, ensuring comprehensive scope, accuracy, and efficiency. (3) A two-stage training strategy for the document re-ranker, which initially constructs a general, domain-specific model using anonymized data, followed by rapid fine-tuning on company-specific data for targeted applications. By integrating our proposed designs, VeritasFi presents a groundbreaking framework that greatly enhances the adaptability and robustness of financial RAG systems, providing a scalable solution for both general-domain and company-specific QA tasks. Code accompanying this work is available at https://github.com/simplew4y/VeritasFi.git.</p></details> |  |
| **[Agentic RAG for Software Testing with Hybrid Vector-Graph and Multi-Agent Orchestration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10824v1)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present an approach to software testing automation using Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems for Quality Engineering (QE) artifact creation. We combine autonomous AI agents with hybrid vector-graph knowledge systems to automate test plan, case, and QE metric generation. Our approach addresses traditional software testing limitations by leveraging LLMs such as Gemini and Mistral, multi-agent orchestration, and enhanced contextualization. The system achieves remarkable accuracy improvements from 65% to 94.8% while ensuring comprehensive document traceability throughout the quality engineering lifecycle. Experimental validation of enterprise Corporate Systems Engineering and SAP migration projects demonstrates an 85% reduction in testing timeline, an 85% improvement in test suite efficiency, and projected 35% cost savings, resulting in a 2-month acceleration of go-live.</p></details> |  |
| **[Is Implicit Knowledge Enough for LLMs? A RAG Approach for Tree-based Structures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10806v1)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are adept at generating responses based on information within their context. While this ability is useful for interacting with structured data like code files, another popular method, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), retrieves relevant documents to augment the model's in-context learning. However, it is not well-explored how to best represent this retrieved knowledge for generating responses on structured data, particularly hierarchical structures like trees. In this work, we propose a novel bottom-up method to linearize knowledge from tree-like structures (like a GitHub repository) by generating implicit, aggregated summaries at each hierarchical level. This approach enables the knowledge to be stored in a knowledge base and used directly with RAG. We then compare our method to using RAG on raw, unstructured code, evaluating the accuracy and quality of the generated responses. Our results show that while response quality is comparable across both methods, our approach generates over 68% fewer documents in the retriever, a significant gain in efficiency. This finding suggests that leveraging implicit, linearized knowledge may be a highly effective and scalable strategy for handling complex, hierarchical data structures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Waiti...</summary><p>Waiting for Conference Response</p></details> |
| **[Review of Inference-Time Scaling Strategies: Reasoning, Search and RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10787v1)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The performance gains of LLMs have historically been driven by scaling up model size and training data. However, the rapidly diminishing availability of high-quality training data is introducing a fundamental bottleneck, shifting the focus of research toward inference-time scaling. This paradigm uses additional computation at the time of deployment to substantially improve LLM performance on downstream tasks without costly model re-training. This review systematically surveys the diverse techniques contributing to this new era of inference-time scaling, organizing the rapidly evolving field into two comprehensive perspectives: Output-focused and Input-focused methods. Output-focused techniques encompass complex, multi-step generation strategies, including reasoning (e.g., CoT, ToT, ReAct), various search and decoding methods (e.g., MCTS, beam search), training for long CoT (e.g., RLVR, GRPO), and model ensemble methods. Input-focused techniques are primarily categorized by few-shot and RAG, with RAG as the central focus. The RAG section is further detailed through a structured examination of query expansion, data, retrieval and reranker, LLM generation methods, and multi-modal RAG.</p></details> |  |
| **[REFRAG: Rethinking RAG based Decoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01092v2)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in leveraging extensive external knowledge to enhance responses in multi-turn and agentic applications, such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). However, processing long-context inputs introduces significant system latency and demands substantial memory for the key-value cache, resulting in reduced throughput and a fundamental trade-off between knowledge enrichment and system efficiency. While minimizing latency for long-context inputs is a primary objective for LLMs, we contend that RAG require specialized consideration. In RAG, much of the LLM context consists of concatenated passages from retrieval, with only a small subset directly relevant to the query. These passages often exhibit low semantic similarity due to diversity or deduplication during re-ranking, leading to block-diagonal attention patterns that differ from those in standard LLM generation tasks. Based on this observation, we argue that most computations over the RAG context during decoding are unnecessary and can be eliminated with minimal impact on performance. To this end, we propose REFRAG, an efficient decoding framework that compresses, senses, and expands to improve latency in RAG applications. By exploiting the sparsity structure, we demonstrate a 30.85 the time-to-first-token acceleration (3.75 improvement to previous work) without loss in perplexity. In addition, our optimization framework for large context enables REFRAG to extend the context size of LLMs by 16. We provide rigorous validation of REFRAG across diverse long-context tasks, including RAG, multi-turn conversations, and long document summarization, spanning a wide range of datasets. Experimental results confirm that REFRAG delivers substantial speedup with no loss in accuracy compared to LLaMA models and other state-of-the-art baselines across various context sizes.</p></details> | <details><summary>fix t...</summary><p>fix typo perplexity->log perplexity; added recent papers</p></details> |
| **[Lightweight Joint Optimization of General-Purpose Vision-Language Models and Retrievers for RAG-Based Medical Diagnosis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17394v3)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieving relevant visual and textual information from medical literature and hospital records can enhance diagnostic accuracy for clinical image interpretation. We develop a multimodal retrieval model jointly optimized with an LVLM for medical diagnosis, unlike standard RAG which doesn't backpropagate LVLM errors to the retriever. Using only general-purpose backbones with lightweight fine-tuning, our model achieves competitive results with medically-pretrained models on clinical classification and VQA tasks. In a novel analysis, we find that different top-retrieved images often yield different predictions for the same target, and that these cases are challenging for all models, even for non-retrieval models. Our joint retrieval optimization significantly improves these cases over standard RAG. However, oracle analysis reveals that while the correct diagnosis is frequently achievable using one of the top retrieved images, in practice there is a large performance gap from the oracle, and rerankers using frontier LVLMs do not close this gap -- leaving ample room for improvement by future methods.

| **[Can Compact Language Models Search Like Agents? Distillation-Guided Policy Optimization for Preserving Agentic RAG Capabilities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20324v3)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning has emerged as a dominant post-training approach to elicit agentic RAG behaviors such as search and planning from language models. Despite its success with larger models, applying RL to compact models (e.g., 0.5--1B parameters) presents unique challenges. The compact models exhibit poor initial performance, resulting in sparse rewards and unstable training. To overcome these difficulties, we propose Distillation-Guided Policy Optimization (DGPO), which employs cold-start initialization from teacher demonstrations and continuous teacher guidance during policy optimization. To understand how compact models preserve agentic behavior, we introduce Agentic RAG Capabilities (ARC), a fine-grained metric analyzing reasoning, search coordination, and response synthesis. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that DGPO enables compact models to achieve sophisticated agentic search behaviors, even outperforming the larger teacher model in some cases. DGPO makes agentic RAG feasible in computing resource-constrained environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[CacheClip: Accelerating RAG with Effective KV Cache Reuse](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10129v1)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems suffer from severe time-to-first-token (TTFT) bottlenecks due to long input sequences. Existing KV cache reuse methods face a fundamental trade-off: prefix caching requires identical prefixes that rarely occur in RAG scenarios, while direct precomputation sacrifices quality due to missing inter-chunk attention and repeated attention sinks. Recent methods like APE and CacheBlend partially address these issues but remain inadequate for robust RAG applications. This paper presents CacheClip, a novel framework that achieves both fast TTFT and high generation quality. Our key insight is that small auxiliary LLMs exhibit similar last-layer attention distributions to primary LLMs (the target model for generation), enabling efficient identification of tokens critical for restoring inter-chunk attention, thereby significantly improving response quality on cross-chunk reasoning tasks. CacheClip integrates three techniques: (1) auxiliary-model-guided token selection for selective KV cache recomputation, where the auxiliary model is finetuned to improve selection accuracy, (2) shared prefixes to eliminate redundant attention sinks, and (3) grouping strategy to maintain local coherence during partial KV cache updates. Experiments show CacheClip retains up to 94.8% and 85.0% of full-attention performance on NIAH and LongBench, outperforming APE and CacheBlend by 25.2% and 35.1% on NIAH (with reomp% = 20%). Meanwhile, CacheClip accelerates LLM inference by up to 1.92x in prefill time, providing a practical solution to the efficiency-quality trade-off in RAG systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Transparent and Robust RAG: Adaptive-Reward Reinforcement Learning for Decision Traceability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13258v2)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) delivers substantial value in knowledge-intensive applications. Many recent works use reinforcement learning (RL) to elicit strong reasoning in RAG generators. However, two key challenges remain unresolved: (1) Transparency: most prior methods do not explicitly indicate which references are actually used during the reasoning that leads to the final answer, limiting interpretability and visibility; (2) Stability: the KL divergence estimator used in existing RL-based approaches may cause gradient spikes, leading to unstable training. To address these challenges, we propose Adaptive-Rewarded Evidence Navigation Agent (ARENA), a transparent and robust RAG generator framework trained via RL with designed rewards. Based on our structured protocol, KL divergence stabilization, and adaptive reward calculation modules, ARENA enables the RAG generator to identify key evidence, perform structured reasoning, and generate answers with interpretable decision traces. Applied to Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct and Llama3.1-8B-Instruct, extensive experiments across multiple baselines show 10-30% accuracy improvements on three multi-hop QA datasets, comparable to advanced closed-source LLMs (e.g., OpenAI o1, DeepSeek R1). Further analyses show that ARENA generalizes well to unseen datasets and tasks. Our models and codes are publicly released.</p></details> |  |
| **[Retrieval is Not Enough: Enhancing RAG Reasoning through Test-Time Critique and Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14858v4)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become a widely adopted paradigm for enabling knowledge-grounded large language models (LLMs). However, standard RAG pipelines often fail to ensure that model reasoning remains consistent with the evidence retrieved, leading to factual inconsistencies or unsupported conclusions. In this work, we reinterpret RAG as Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning and identify a central but underexplored problem: Reasoning Misalignment -- the divergence between an LLM's internal reasoning trajectory and the evidential constraints provided by retrieval. To address this issue, we propose AlignRAG, a novel iterative framework grounded in Critique-Driven Alignment (CDA). We further introduce AlignRAG-auto, an autonomous variant that dynamically terminates refinement, removing the need to pre-specify the number of critique iterations. At the heart of AlignRAG lies a contrastive critique synthesis mechanism that generates retrieval-sensitive critiques while mitigating self-bias. This mechanism trains a dedicated retrieval-augmented Critic Language Model (CLM) using labeled critiques that distinguish between evidence-aligned and misaligned reasoning. Empirical evaluations show that our approach significantly improves reasoning fidelity. Our 8B-parameter CLM improves performance over the Self-Refine baseline by 12.1% on out-of-domain tasks and outperforms a standard 72B-parameter CLM by 2.2%. Furthermore, AlignRAG-auto achieves this state-of-the-art performance while dynamically determining the optimal number of refinement steps, enhancing efficiency and usability. AlignRAG remains compatible with existing RAG architectures as a plug-and-play module and demonstrates strong robustness under both informative and noisy retrieval scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[SeCon-RAG: A Two-Stage Semantic Filtering and Conflict-Free Framework for Trustworthy RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09710v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems enhance large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge but are vulnerable to corpus poisoning and contamination attacks, which can compromise output integrity. Existing defenses often apply aggressive filtering, leading to unnecessary loss of valuable information and reduced reliability in generation. To address this problem, we propose a two-stage semantic filtering and conflict-free framework for trustworthy RAG. In the first stage, we perform a joint filter with semantic and cluster-based filtering which is guided by the Entity-intent-relation extractor (EIRE). EIRE extracts entities, latent objectives, and entity relations from both the user query and filtered documents, scores their semantic relevance, and selectively adds valuable documents into the clean retrieval database. In the second stage, we proposed an EIRE-guided conflict-aware filtering module, which analyzes semantic consistency between the query, candidate answers, and retrieved knowledge before final answer generation, filtering out internal and external contradictions that could mislead the model. Through this two-stage process, SeCon-RAG effectively preserves useful knowledge while mitigating conflict contamination, achieving significant improvements in both generation robustness and output trustworthiness. Extensive experiments across various LLMs and datasets demonstrate that the proposed SeCon-RAG markedly outperforms state-of-the-art defense methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[EcphoryRAG: Re-Imagining Knowledge-Graph RAG via Human Associative Memory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08958v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cognitive neuroscience research indicates that humans leverage cues to activate entity-centered memory traces (engrams) for complex, multi-hop recollection. Inspired by this mechanism, we introduce EcphoryRAG, an entity-centric knowledge graph RAG framework. During indexing, EcphoryRAG extracts and stores only core entities with corresponding metadata, a lightweight approach that reduces token consumption by up to 94\% compared to other structured RAG systems. For retrieval, the system first extracts cue entities from queries, then performs a scalable multi-hop associative search across the knowledge graph. Crucially, EcphoryRAG dynamically infers implicit relations between entities to populate context, enabling deep reasoning without exhaustive pre-enumeration of relationships. Extensive evaluations on the 2WikiMultiHop, HotpotQA, and MuSiQue benchmarks demonstrate that EcphoryRAG sets a new state-of-the-art, improving the average Exact Match (EM) score from 0.392 to 0.474 over strong KG-RAG methods like HippoRAG. These results validate the efficacy of the entity-cue-multi-hop retrieval paradigm for complex question answering.</p></details> |  |
| **[UNIDOC-BENCH: A Unified Benchmark for Document-Centric Multimodal RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03663v2)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal retrieval-augmented generation (MM-RAG) is a key approach for applying large language models (LLMs) and agents to real-world knowledge bases, yet current evaluations are fragmented, focusing on either text or images in isolation or on simplified multimodal setups that fail to capture document-centric multimodal use cases. In this paper, we introduce UniDoc-Bench, the first large-scale, realistic benchmark for MM-RAG built from 70k real-world PDF pages across eight domains. Our pipeline extracts and links evidence from text, tables, and figures, then generates 1,600 multimodal QA pairs spanning factual retrieval, comparison, summarization, and logical reasoning queries. To ensure reliability, 20% of QA pairs are validated by multiple annotators and expert adjudication. UniDoc-Bench supports apples-to-apples comparison across four paradigms: (1) text-only, (2) image-only, (3) multimodal text-image fusion, and (4) multimodal joint retrieval -- under a unified protocol with standardized candidate pools, prompts, and evaluation metrics. Our experiments show that multimodal text-image fusion RAG systems consistently outperform both unimodal and jointly multimodal embedding-based retrieval, indicating that neither text nor images alone are sufficient and that current multimodal embeddings remain inadequate. Beyond benchmarking, our analysis reveals when and how visual context complements textual evidence, uncovers systematic failure modes, and offers actionable guidance for developing more robust MM-RAG pipelines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Who Stole Your Data? A Method for Detecting Unauthorized RAG Theft](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07728v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by mitigating hallucinations and outdated information issues, yet simultaneously facilitates unauthorized data appropriation at scale. This paper addresses this challenge through two key contributions. First, we introduce RPD, a novel dataset specifically designed for RAG plagiarism detection that encompasses diverse professional domains and writing styles, overcoming limitations in existing resources. Second, we develop a dual-layered watermarking system that embeds protection at both semantic and lexical levels, complemented by an interrogator-detective framework that employs statistical hypothesis testing on accumulated evidence. Extensive experimentation demonstrates our approach's effectiveness across varying query volumes, defense prompts, and retrieval parameters, while maintaining resilience against adversarial evasion techniques. This work establishes a foundational framework for intellectual property protection in retrieval-augmented AI systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[SUBQRAG: sub-question driven dynamic graph rag](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07718v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Graph RAG) effectively builds a knowledge graph (KG) to connect disparate facts across a large document corpus. However, this broad-view approach often lacks the deep structured reasoning needed for complex multi-hop question answering (QA), leading to incomplete evidence and error accumulation. To address these limitations, we propose SubQRAG, a sub-question-driven framework that enhances reasoning depth. SubQRAG decomposes a complex question into an ordered chain of verifiable sub-questions. For each sub-question, it retrieves relevant triples from the graph. When the existing graph is insufficient, the system dynamically expands it by extracting new triples from source documents in real time. All triples used in the reasoning process are aggregated into a "graph memory," forming a structured and traceable evidence path for final answer generation. Experiments on three multi-hop QA benchmarks demonstrate that SubQRAG achieves consistent and significant improvements, especially in Exact Match scores.</p></details> | 5 pages, 1 figure |
| **[Efficient and Transferable Agentic Knowledge Graph RAG via Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26383v3)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge-graph retrieval-augmented generation (KG-RAG) couples large language models (LLMs) with structured, verifiable knowledge graphs (KGs) to reduce hallucinations and expose reasoning traces. However, many KG-RAG systems compose multiple LLM modules (e.g planning, reasoning, and responding), inflating inference cost and binding behavior to a specific target KG. To address this, we introduce KG-R1, an agentic KG retrieval-augmented generation (KG-RAG) framework through reinforcement learning (RL). KG-R1 utilizes a single agent that interacts with KGs as its environment, learning to retrieve at each step and incorporating the retrieved information into its reasoning and generation. The process is optimized through end-to-end RL. In controlled experiments across Knowledge-Graph Question Answering (KGQA) benchmarks, our method demonstrates both efficiency and transferability: Using Qwen-2.5-3B, KG-R1 improves answer accuracy with fewer generation tokens than prior multi-module workflow methods that use larger foundation or fine-tuned models. Furthermore, KG-R1 enables plug and play: after training, it maintains strong accuracy on new KGs without modification. These properties make KG-R1 a promising KG-RAG framework for real-world deployment. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/Jinyeop3110/KG-R1.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures. Submitted to ICLR 2026</p></details> |

However, conventional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods encode content in isolated chunks during ingestion, losing structural and cross-page dependencies, and retrieve a fixed number of pages at inference, regardless of the specific demands of the question or context. This often results in incomplete evidence retrieval and degraded answer quality for multi-page reasoning tasks. To address these limitations, we propose LAD-RAG, a novel Layout-Aware Dynamic RAG framework. During ingestion, LAD-RAG constructs a symbolic document graph that captures layout structure and cross-page dependencies, adding it alongside standard neural embeddings to yield a more holistic representation of the document. During inference, an LLM agent dynamically interacts with the neural and symbolic indices to adaptively retrieve the necessary evidence based on the query. Experiments on MMLongBench-Doc, LongDocURL, DUDE, and MP-DocVQA demonstrate that LAD-RAG improves retrieval, achieving over 90% perfect recall on average without any top-k tuning, and outperforming baseline retrievers by up to 20% in recall at comparable noise levels, yielding higher QA accuracy with minimal latency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Reliable Retrieval in RAG Systems for Large Legal Datasets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06999v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a promising approach to mitigate hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) for legal applications, but its reliability is critically dependent on the accuracy of the retrieval step. This is particularly challenging in the legal domain, where large databases of structurally similar documents often cause retrieval systems to fail. In this paper, we address this challenge by first identifying and quantifying a critical failure mode we term Document-Level Retrieval Mismatch (DRM), where the retriever selects information from entirely incorrect source documents. To mitigate DRM, we investigate a simple and computationally efficient technique which we refer to as Summary-Augmented Chunking (SAC). This method enhances each text chunk with a document-level synthetic summary, thereby injecting crucial global context that would otherwise be lost during a standard chunking process. Our experiments on a diverse set of legal information retrieval tasks show that SAC greatly reduces DRM and, consequently, also improves text-level retrieval precision and recall. Interestingly, we find that a generic summarization strategy outperforms an approach that incorporates legal expert domain knowledge to target specific legal elements. Our work provides evidence that this practical, scalable, and easily integrable technique enhances the reliability of RAG systems when applied to large-scale legal document datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for the 7th Natural Legal Language Processing Workshop (NLLP 2025), co-located with EMNLP 2025</p></details> |

However, its application in sensitive domains is limited by privacy risks. Existing private RAG methods typically rely on query-time differential privacy (DP), which requires repeated noise injection and leads to accumulated privacy loss. To address this issue, we propose DP-SynRAG, a framework that uses LLMs to generate differentially private synthetic RAG databases. Unlike prior methods, the synthetic text can be reused once created, thereby avoiding repeated noise injection and additional privacy costs. To preserve essential information for downstream RAG tasks, DP-SynRAG extends private prediction, which instructs LLMs to generate text that mimics subsampled database records in a DP manner. Experiments show that DP-SynRAG achieves superior performanec to the state-of-the-art private RAG systems while maintaining a fixed privacy budget, offering a scalable solution for privacy-preserving RAG.</p></details> | Under review |

This grounding improves factuality, reduces hallucination, and extends reasoning beyond parametric knowledge. However, this reliance on external knowledge poses a critical yet underexplored safety risk: knowledge poisoning attacks, where adversaries deliberately inject adversarial multimodal content into external knowledge bases to steer model toward generating incorrect or even harmful responses. To expose such vulnerabilities, we propose MM-PoisonRAG, the first framework to systematically design knowledge poisoning in multimodal RAG. We introduce two complementary attack strategies: Localized Poisoning Attack (LPA), which implants targeted multimodal misinformation to manipulate specific queries, and Globalized Poisoning Attack (GPA), which inserts a single adversarial knowledge to broadly disrupt reasoning and induce nonsensical responses across all queries. Comprehensive experiments across tasks, models, and access settings show that LPA achieves targeted manipulation with attack success rates of up to 56%, while GPA completely disrupts model generation to 0% accuracy with just a single adversarial knowledge injection. Our results reveal the fragility of multimodal RAG and highlight the urgent need for defenses against knowledge poisoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is available at https://github.com/HyeonjeongHa/MM-PoisonRAG</p></details> |
| **[Deterministic Legal Retrieval: An Action API for Querying the SAT-Graph RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06002v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Structure-Aware Temporal Graph RAG (SAT-Graph RAG) addresses core limitations of standard Retrieval-Augmented Generation in the legal domain by providing a verifiable knowledge graph that models hierarchical structure, temporal evolution, and causal events of legal norms. However, a critical gap remains: how to reliably query this structured knowledge without sacrificing its deterministic properties. This paper introduces the SAT-Graph API, a formal query execution layer centered on canonical actions-atomic, composable, and auditable primitives that isolate probabilistic discovery from deterministic retrieval. These actions enable: (i) high-precision hybrid search; (ii) robust reference resolution; (iii) point-in-time version retrieval; and (iv) auditable causal tracing. We demonstrate how planner-guided agents can decompose complex queries into Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) of these actions. This two-layer architecture transforms retrieval from an opaque black box to a transparent, auditable process, directly addressing Explainable AI (XAI) requirements for high-stakes domains.</p></details> |  |

It leverages graphs to model the hierarchical structure between specific concepts, enabling more coherent and effective knowledge retrieval for accurate reasoning.Despite its conceptual promise, recent studies report that GraphRAG frequently underperforms vanilla RAG on many real-world tasks. This raises a critical question: Is GraphRAG really effective, and in which scenarios do graph structures provide measurable benefits for RAG systems? To address this, we propose GraphRAG-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate GraphRAG models onboth hierarchical knowledge retrieval and deep contextual reasoning. GraphRAG-Bench features a comprehensive dataset with tasks of increasing difficulty, coveringfact retrieval, complex reasoning, contextual summarization, and creative generation, and a systematic evaluation across the entire pipeline, from graph constructionand knowledge retrieval to final generation. Leveraging this novel benchmark, we systematically investigate the conditions when GraphRAG surpasses traditional RAG and the underlying reasons for its success, offering guidelines for its practical application.

However, existing approaches underutilize the inherent knowledge of large language models (LLMs), leading to suboptimal retrieval decisions and degraded generation performance. To bridge this gap, we propose Self-Routing RAG (SR-RAG), a novel framework that binds selective retrieval with knowledge verbalization. SR-RAG enables an LLM to dynamically decide whether to retrieve external knowledge or verbalize its own parametric knowledge. To this end, we design a multi-task objective that jointly optimizes an LLM for knowledge source selection, knowledge verbalization, and response generation. SR-RAG further incorporates a nearest neighbor search mechanism at inference time to improve the accuracy of knowledge source decisions under domain shifts. Fine-tuning three LLMs with SR-RAG significantly improves both their response accuracy and reduces the inference latency. Compared to the strongest selective retrieval baseline, SR-RAG reduces the number of retrievals by 29% while improving performance by 5.1%.</p></details> |  |

Using the Operations and Maintenance Intelligence (OMIn) dataset, we construct a QA benchmark spanning global sensemaking and actionable maintenance tasks. KEO builds a structured Knowledge Graph (KG) and integrates it into a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline, enabling more coherent, dataset-wide reasoning than traditional text-chunk RAG. We evaluate locally deployable LLMs (Gemma-3, Phi-4, Mistral-Nemo) and employ stronger models (GPT-4o, Llama-3.3) as judges. Experiments show that KEO markedly improves global sensemaking by revealing patterns and system-level insights, while text-chunk RAG remains effective for fine-grained procedural tasks requiring localized retrieval. These findings underscore the promise of KG-augmented LLMs for secure, domain-specific QA and their potential in high-stakes reasoning.</p></details> |  |

However, despite their widespread use, popular datasets such as WebQSP and CWQ suffer from critical quality issues, including inaccurate or incomplete ground-truth annotations, poorly constructed questions that are ambiguous, trivial, or unanswerable, and outdated or inconsistent knowledge. Through a manual audit of 16 popular KGQA datasets, including WebQSP and CWQ, we find that the average factual correctness rate is only 57 %. To address these issues, we introduce KGQAGen, an LLM-in-the-loop framework that systematically resolves these pitfalls. KGQAGen combines structured knowledge grounding, LLM-guided generation, and symbolic verification to produce challenging and verifiable QA instances. Using KGQAGen, we construct KGQAGen-10k, a ten-thousand scale benchmark grounded in Wikidata, and evaluate a diverse set of KG-RAG models. Experimental results demonstrate that even state-of-the-art systems struggle on this benchmark, highlighting its ability to expose limitations of existing models. Our findings advocate for more rigorous benchmark construction and position KGQAGen as a scalable framework for advancing KGQA evaluation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025 Datasets and Benchmarks Track</p></details> |

Investigating Robustness of Guardrails under RAG-style Contexts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05310v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the increasing adoption of large language models (LLMs), ensuring the safety of LLM systems has become a pressing concern. External LLM-based guardrail models have emerged as a popular solution to screen unsafe inputs and outputs, but they are themselves fine-tuned or prompt-engineered LLMs that are vulnerable to data distribution shifts. In this paper, taking Retrieval Augmentation Generation (RAG) as a case study, we investigated how robust LLM-based guardrails are against additional information embedded in the context. Through a systematic evaluation of 3 Llama Guards and 2 GPT-oss models, we confirmed that inserting benign documents into the guardrail context alters the judgments of input and output guardrails in around 11% and 8% of cases, making them unreliable. We separately analyzed the effect of each component in the augmented context: retrieved documents, user query, and LLM-generated response. The two mitigation methods we tested only bring minor improvements. These results expose a context-robustness gap in current guardrails and motivate training and evaluation protocols that are robust to retrieval and query composition.</p></details> |  |
| **[ModernBERT + ColBERT: Enhancing biomedical RAG through an advanced re-ranking retriever](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04757v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a powerful technique for enriching Large Language Models (LLMs) with external knowledge, allowing for factually grounded responses, a critical requirement in high-stakes domains such as healthcare. However, the efficacy of RAG systems is fundamentally restricted by the performance of their retrieval module, since irrelevant or semantically misaligned documents directly compromise the accuracy of the final generated response. General-purpose dense retrievers can struggle with the nuanced language of specialised domains, while the high accuracy of in-domain models is often achieved at prohibitive computational costs. In this work, we aim to address this trade-off by developing and evaluating a two-stage retrieval architecture that combines a lightweight ModernBERT bidirectional encoder for efficient initial candidate retrieval with a ColBERTv2 late-interaction model for fine-grained re-ranking. We conduct comprehensive evaluations of our retriever module performance and RAG system performance in the biomedical context, fine-tuning the IR module using 10k question-passage pairs from PubMedQA. Our analysis of the retriever module confirmed the positive impact of the ColBERT re-ranker, which improved Recall@3 by up to 4.2 percentage points compared to its retrieve-only counterpart. When integrated into the biomedical RAG, our IR module leads to a state-of-the-art average accuracy of 0.4448 on the five tasks of the MIRAGE question-answering benchmark, outperforming strong baselines such as MedCPT (0.4436). Our ablation studies reveal that this performance is critically dependent on a joint fine-tuning process that aligns the retriever and re-ranker; otherwise, the re-ranker might degrade the performance.</p></details> |  |

The framework enables users to generate 3D-CG content solely through natural language instructions. 3Dify is built upon Dify, an open-source platform for AI application development, and incorporates several state-of-the-art LLM-related technologies such as the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). For 3D-CG generation support, 3Dify automates the operation of various Digital Content Creation (DCC) tools via MCP. When DCC tools do not support MCP-based interaction, the framework employs the Computer-Using Agent (CUA) method to automate Graphical User Interface (GUI) operations. Moreover, to enhance image generation quality, 3Dify allows users to provide feedback by selecting preferred images from multiple candidates. The LLM then learns variable patterns from these selections and applies them to subsequent generations. Furthermore, 3Dify supports the integration of locally deployed LLMs, enabling users to utilize custom-developed models and to reduce both time and monetary costs associated with external API calls by leveraging their own computational resources.</p></details> |  |

While scaling generators improves accuracy, it also raises cost and limits deployability. We explore an orthogonal axis: enlarging the retriever's corpus to reduce reliance on large LLMs. Experimental results show that corpus scaling consistently strengthens RAG and can often serve as a substitute for increasing model size, though with diminishing returns at larger scales. Small- and mid-sized generators paired with larger corpora often rival much larger models with smaller corpora; mid-sized models tend to gain the most, while tiny and large models benefit less. Our analysis shows that improvements arise primarily from increased coverage of answer-bearing passages, while utilization efficiency remains largely unchanged. These findings establish a principled corpus-generator trade-off: investing in larger corpora offers an effective path to stronger RAG, often comparable to enlarging the LLM itself.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances in large vision-language models (LVLMs) provide opportunities to automate safety inspections through enhanced visual and linguistic understanding. However, existing applications face limitations including irrelevant or unspecific responses, restricted modal inputs and hallucinations. Utilisation of Large Language Models (LLMs) for this purpose is constrained by availability of training data and frequently lack real-time adaptability. This study introduces SiteShield, a multi-modal LVLM-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework for automating construction safety inspection reports by integrating visual and audio inputs. Using real-world data, SiteShield outperformed unimodal LLMs without RAG with an F1 score of 0.82, hamming loss of 0.04, precision of 0.76, and recall of 0.96. The findings indicate that SiteShield offers a novel pathway to enhance information retrieval and efficiency in generating safety reports.</p></details> | <details><summary>33 pa...</summary><p>33 pages, 11 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

In real-world scenarios, beyond pure text, a substantial amount of knowledge is stored in tables, and user questions often require retrieving answers that are distributed across multiple tables. Retrieving knowledge from a table corpora (i.e., various individual tables) for a question remains nascent, at least, for (i) how to understand intra- and inter-table knowledge effectively, (ii) how to filter unnecessary tables and how to retrieve the most relevant tables efficiently, (iii) how to prompt LLMs to infer over the retrieval, (iv) how to evaluate the corresponding performance in a realistic setting. Facing the above challenges, in this paper, we first propose a table-corpora-aware RAG framework, named T-RAG, which consists of the hierarchical memory index, multi-stage retrieval, and graph-aware prompting for effective and efficient table knowledge retrieval and inference. Further, we first develop a multi-table question answering benchmark named MultiTableQA, which spans 3 different task types, 57,193 tables, and 23,758 questions in total, and the sources are all from real-world scenarios. Based on MultiTableQA, we did the holistic comparison over table retrieval methods, RAG methods, and table-to-graph representation learning methods, where T-RAG shows the leading accuracy, recall, and running time performance.

When applying reasoning in specialized contexts with LLMs on top of a RAG, the pipeline can capture contextually relevant information, but it is not designed to retrieve comparable cases or related problems. While RAG is effective at extracting factual information, its outputs in specialized reasoning tasks often remain generic, reflecting broad facts rather than context-specific insights. In finance, it results in generic risks that are true for the majority of companies. To address this limitation, we propose a peer-aware comparative inference layer on top of RAG. Our contrastive approach outperforms baseline RAG in text generation metrics such as ROUGE and BERTScore in comparison with human-generated equity research and risk.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 1 figure, Workshop on Generative AI in Finance, NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

It adversely affects performance on downstream tasks such as question answering (QA). Existing approaches often attempt to mitigate conflicts by directly comparing two knowledge sources in a side-by-side manner, but this can overwhelm LLMs with extraneous or lengthy contexts, ultimately hindering their ability to identify and mitigate inconsistencies. To address this issue, we propose Micro-Act a framework with a hierarchical action space that automatically perceives context complexity and adaptively decomposes each knowledge source into a sequence of fine-grained comparisons. These comparisons are represented as actionable steps, enabling reasoning beyond the superficial context. Through extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets, Micro-Act consistently achieves significant increase in QA accuracy over state-of-the-art baselines across all 5 datasets and 3 conflict types, especially in temporal and semantic types where all baselines fail significantly. More importantly, Micro-Act exhibits robust performance on non-conflict questions simultaneously, highlighting its practical value in real-world RAG applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACL 2025 Main</p></details> |

In this work, we investigate a critical question: does the benefit of these complex robust training methods diminish as language models become more powerful? Through systematic evaluation across multiple model scales and question-answering datasets, our analysis reveals a consistent trend: \emph{the marginal robustness benefit of sophisticated training strategies decreases substantially as model capacity increases.} While smaller models show significant performance improvements from complex document selection and adversarial objectives, more capable models achieve comparable or even superior performance with simpler training approaches. Further investigation demonstrates that stronger models naturally exhibit better confidence calibration, cross-dataset generalization capability, and more effective attention patterns, even under simple training regimes. These findings suggest that as foundation models evolve, the engineering effort invested in complex robust training may yield diminishing returns, indicating that simplified RAG pipelines could suffice for powerful models while maintaining competitive performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at SIGIR-AP 2025</p></details> |

We present PunGPT2, the first fully open-source Punjabi generative model suite, trained on a 35GB corpus covering literature, religious texts, news, social discourse, etc. PunGPT2 captures Punjabi's syntactic and morphological richness through a tokenizer optimized for Gurmukhi and Shahmukhi scripts. We introduce Pun-RAG, a retrieval-augmented framework integrating PunGPT2 with a FAISS retriever over a curated Punjabi knowledge base, and Pun-Instruct, an instruction-tuned variant using QLoRA for robust zero-shot summarization, translation, and question answering. Our key innovation, Quantum-RAG, fuses sparse, dense, and quantum kernel embeddings for efficient, context-aware retrieval with low memory overhead, marking the first practical quantum-inspired retrieval in a low-resource LLM. Our models outperform multilingual baselines (mBERT, mT5, MuRIL, BLOOM) on FLORES-200, IndicGenBench, and a new PunjabiEval suite. Quantum-RAG yields +7.4 Recall@10 over FAISS and +3.5 BLEU over mT5 on PunjabiEval. We publicly release all training scripts, hyperparameters, evaluation pipelines, the 35GB Punjabi corpus, the PunjabiEval benchmark, and all model weights, establishing new state-of-the-art results for Punjabi language generation and retrieval.</p></details> |  |

One of the most essential applications of LLM is Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), which greatly enhances generated content's reliability and relevance. However, evaluating RAG systems remains a challenging task. Traditional evaluation metrics struggle to effectively capture the key features of modern LLM-generated content that often exhibits high fluency and naturalness. Inspired by the RAGAS tool, a well-known RAG evaluation framework, we extended this framework into a KG-based evaluation paradigm, enabling multi-hop reasoning and semantic community clustering to derive more comprehensive scoring metrics. By incorporating these comprehensive evaluation criteria, we gain a deeper understanding of RAG systems and a more nuanced perspective on their performance. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we compare its performance with RAGAS scores and construct a human-annotated subset to assess the correlation between human judgments and automated metrics. In addition, we conduct targeted experiments to demonstrate that our KG-based evaluation method is more sensitive to subtle semantic differences in generated outputs. Finally, we discuss the key challenges in evaluating RAG systems and highlight potential directions for future research.</p></details> |  |

The existing methods can be categorized into Large Vision-Language Model (LVLM)-based and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based methods. However, the former were susceptible to hallucinations, while the latter struggled for inter-modal disconnection and cross-page fragmentation. To address these challenges, a novel multi-modal RAG model, named MHier-RAG, was proposed, leveraging both textual and visual information across long-range pages to facilitate accurate question answering for visual-rich documents. A hierarchical indexing method with the integration of flattened in-page chunks and topological cross-page chunks was designed to jointly establish in-page multi-modal associations and long-distance cross-page dependencies. By means of joint similarity evaluation and large language model (LLM)-based re-ranking, a multi-granularity semantic retrieval method, including the page-level parent page retrieval and document-level summary retrieval, was proposed to foster multi-modal evidence connection and long-distance evidence integration and reasoning. Experimental results performed on public datasets, MMLongBench-Doc and LongDocURL, demonstrated the superiority of our MHier-RAG method in understanding and answering modality-rich and multi-page documents.</p></details> | <details><summary>Comme...</summary><p>Comments: Update Title, Author, Abstract, etc</p></details> |

However, these systems remain prone to hallucinations due to limited factual grounding. While text-based dialogue systems address this challenge by integrating tools such as web search and knowledge graph APIs, we introduce the first approach to extend tool use directly into speech-in speech-out systems. A key challenge is that tool integration substantially increases response latency, disrupting conversational flow. To mitigate this, we propose Streaming Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Streaming RAG), a novel framework that reduces user-perceived latency by predicting tool queries in parallel with user speech, even before the user finishes speaking. Specifically, we develop a post-training pipeline that teaches the model when to issue tool calls during ongoing speech and how to generate spoken summaries that fuse audio queries with retrieved text results, thereby improving both accuracy and responsiveness. To evaluate our approach, we construct AudioCRAG, a benchmark created by converting queries from the publicly available CRAG dataset into speech form. Experimental results demonstrate that our streaming RAG approach increases QA accuracy by up to 200% relative (from 11.1% to 34.2% absolute) and further enhances user experience by reducing tool use latency by 20%. Importantly, our streaming RAG approach is modality-agnostic and can be applied equally to typed input, paving the way for more agentic, real-time AI assistants.</p></details> |  |

Current biomedical question-answering systems primarily focus on short-form answers, failing to provide the comprehensive explanations necessary for clinical decision-making. We present RAG-BioQA, a novel framework combining retrieval-augmented generation with domain-specific fine-tuning to produce evidence-based, long-form biomedical answers. Our approach integrates BioBERT embeddings with FAISS indexing and compares various re-ranking strategies (BM25, ColBERT, MonoT5) to optimize context selection before synthesizing evidence through a fine-tuned T5 model. Experimental results on the PubMedQA dataset show significant improvements over baselines, with our best model achieving substantial gains across BLEU, ROUGE, and METEOR metrics, advancing the state of accessible, evidence-based biomedical knowledge retrieval.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fine-tuning with RAG for Improving LLM Learning of New Skills](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01375v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM) agents deployed for multi-step tasks frequently fail in predictable ways: attempting actions with unmet preconditions, issuing redundant commands, or mishandling environment constraints. While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) can improve performance by providing runtime guidance, it requires maintaining external knowledge databases and adds computational overhead at every deployment. We propose a simple pipeline that converts inference-time retrieval into learned competence through distillation. Our approach: (1) extracts compact, reusable hints from agent failures, (2) uses these hints to generate improved teacher trajectories via one-shot retrieval at episode start, and (3) trains student models on these trajectories with hint strings removed, forcing internalization rather than memorization. Across two interactive benchmarks, ALFWorld (household tasks) and WebShop (online shopping), distilled students consistently outperform baseline agents, achieving up to 91% success on ALFWorld (vs. 79% for baselines) and improving WebShop scores to 72 (vs. 61 for baselines), while using 10-60% fewer tokens than retrieval-augmented teachers depending on the environment. The approach generalizes across model scales (7B/14B parameters) and agent architectures (ReAct/StateAct), demonstrating that retrieval benefits can be effectively internalized through targeted fine-tuning without permanent runtime dependencies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review at ICLR 2026</p></details> |
| **[Metaphor identification using large language models: A comparison of RAG, prompt engineering, and fine-tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24866v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Metaphor is a pervasive feature of discourse and a powerful lens for examining cognition, emotion, and ideology. Large-scale analysis, however, has been constrained by the need for manual annotation due to the context-sensitive nature of metaphor. This study investigates the potential of large language models (LLMs) to automate metaphor identification in full texts. We compare three methods: (i) retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), where the model is provided with a codebook and instructed to annotate texts based on its rules and examples; (ii) prompt engineering, where we design task-specific verbal instructions; and (iii) fine-tuning, where the model is trained on hand-coded texts to optimize performance. Within prompt engineering, we test zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought strategies. Our results show that state-of-the-art closed-source LLMs can achieve high accuracy, with fine-tuning yielding a median F1 score of 0.79. A comparison of human and LLM outputs reveals that most discrepancies are systematic, reflecting well-known grey areas and conceptual challenges in metaphor theory. We propose that LLMs can be used to at least partly automate metaphor identification and can serve as a testbed for developing and refining metaphor identification protocols and the theory that underpins them.</p></details> |  |

We introduce Eyes-on-Me, a modular attack that decomposes an adversarial document into reusable Attention Attractors and Focus Regions. Attractors are optimized to direct attention to the Focus Region. Attackers can then insert semantic baits for the retriever or malicious instructions for the generator, adapting to new targets at near zero cost. This is achieved by steering a small subset of attention heads that we empirically identify as strongly correlated with attack success. Across 18 end-to-end RAG settings (3 datasets $\times$ 2 retrievers $\times$ 3 generators), Eyes-on-Me raises average attack success rates from 21.9 to 57.8 (+35.9 points, 2.6$\times$ over prior work). A single optimized attractor transfers to unseen black box retrievers and generators without retraining. Our findings establish a scalable paradigm for RAG data poisoning and show that modular, reusable components pose a practical threat to modern AI systems. They also reveal a strong link between attention concentration and model outputs, informing interpretability research.</p></details> |  |

Building on Gienapp's utility-dimension framework, we designed a human-centred questionnaire that assesses RAG outputs across 12 dimensions. We iteratively refined the questionnaire through several rounds of ratings on a set of query-output pairs and semantic discussions. Ultimately, we incorporated feedback from both a human rater and a human-LLM pair. Results indicate that while large language models (LLMs) reliably focus on metric descriptions and scale labels, they exhibit weaknesses in detecting textual format variations. Humans struggled to focus strictly on metric descriptions and labels. LLM ratings and explanations were viewed as a helpful support, but numeric LLM and human ratings lacked agreement. The final questionnaire extends the initial framework by focusing on user intent, text structuring, and information verifiability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Silent Leaks: Implicit Knowledge Extraction Attack on RAG Systems through Benign Queries](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15420v2)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enhance large language models (LLMs) by incorporating external knowledge bases, but this may expose them to extraction attacks, leading to potential copyright and privacy risks. However, existing extraction methods typically rely on malicious inputs such as prompt injection or jailbreaking, making them easily detectable via input- or output-level detection. In this paper, we introduce Implicit Knowledge Extraction Attack (IKEA), which conducts Knowledge Extraction on RAG systems through benign queries. Specifically, IKEA first leverages anchor concepts-keywords related to internal knowledge-to generate queries with a natural appearance, and then designs two mechanisms that lead anchor concepts to thoroughly "explore" the RAG's knowledge: (1) Experience Reflection Sampling, which samples anchor concepts based on past query-response histories, ensuring their relevance to the topic; (2) Trust Region Directed Mutation, which iteratively mutates anchor concepts under similarity constraints to further exploit the embedding space. Extensive experiments demonstrate IKEA's effectiveness under various defenses, surpassing baselines by over 80% in extraction efficiency and 90% in attack success rate. Moreover, the substitute RAG system built from IKEA's extractions shows comparable performance to the original RAG and outperforms those based on baselines across multiple evaluation tasks, underscoring the stealthy copyright infringement risk in RAG systems.</p></details> |  |

We propose Knowledgeable-R1, a reinforcement-learning framework that explicitly trains large language models to use parametric knowledge (PK) to resist contextual interference while still exploiting external context when it is reliably helpful. Knowledgeable-R1 introduces a joint sampling scheme that generates paired responses with and without retrieval, and learns both local advantages (within each decoding regime) and global advantages under the same input to quantify when to ignore misleading context versus adopt it. We employ an asymmetric advantage transformation that amplifies exploratory behaviors toward parametric knowledge. Experiments show that \method significantly improves robustness and reasoning accuracy in knowledge conflict scenarios and general RAG scenarios, outperforming SOTA baselines by 23% in counterfactual scenarios, and without degradation when the retrieved context is fully accurate.Our code are available at https://github.com/lcy80366872/knowledgeable-R1.</p></details> |  |
| **[SimulRAG: Simulator-based RAG for Grounding LLMs in Long-form Scientific QA](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25459v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) show promise in solving scientific problems. They can help generate long-form answers for scientific questions, which are crucial for comprehensive understanding of complex phenomena that require detailed explanations spanning multiple interconnected concepts and evidence. However, LLMs often suffer from hallucination, especially in the challenging task of long-form scientific question answering. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approaches can ground LLMs by incorporating external knowledge sources to improve trustworthiness. In this context, scientific simulators, which play a vital role in validating hypotheses, offer a particularly promising retrieval source to mitigate hallucination and enhance answer factuality. However, existing RAG approaches cannot be directly applied for scientific simulation-based retrieval due to two fundamental challenges: how to retrieve from scientific simulators, and how to efficiently verify and update long-form answers. To overcome these challenges, we propose the simulator-based RAG framework (SimulRAG) and provide a long-form scientific QA benchmark covering climate science and epidemiology with ground truth verified by both simulations and human annotators. In this framework, we propose a generalized simulator retrieval interface to transform between textual and numerical modalities. We further design a claim-level generation method that utilizes uncertainty estimation scores and simulator boundary assessment (UE+SBA) to efficiently verify and update claims. Extensive experiments demonstrate SimulRAG outperforms traditional RAG baselines by 30.4% in informativeness and 16.3% in factuality. UE+SBA further improves efficiency and quality for claim-level generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Haozh...</summary><p>Haozhou Xu and Dongxia Wu are co-first authors</p></details> |

The proposed approach overcomes limitations of existing methods by enabling fine-grained control over item difficulty, psychometric calibration, and cognitive alignment. It employs multi-graph isolation to preserve domain-specific semantics and leverages a distributed agent architecture coordinated through Data Distribution Service, abbreviated as DDS, for scalable and fault-tolerant operations. Each agent specializes in tasks such as retrieval, generation, or evaluation, forming a modular and traceable pipeline. Distinctively, the framework encodes semantic hierarchies, PageRank-based concept weighting, and assessment-theory parameters directly into the generation process, ensuring that questions are both contextually grounded and cognitively calibrated. Deployed at Taiwan's National Institute of Environmental Research, the system has demonstrated practical value by reducing manual workload, improving reliability and validity, and supporting both adaptive and standardized assessments. By integrating psychometric theory with AI-driven retrieval and generation, this work establishes a scalable and cognitively aligned solution for education and professional certification.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures and 6 tables</p></details> |
| **[Multimodal Iterative RAG for Knowledge-Intensive Visual Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00798v4)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models~(MLLMs) have significantly enhanced the ability of these models in multimodal understanding and reasoning. However, the performance of MLLMs for knowledge-intensive visual questions, which require external knowledge beyond the visual content of an image, still remains limited. While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a promising solution to provide models with external knowledge, its conventional single-pass framework often fails to gather sufficient knowledge. To overcome this limitation, we propose MI-RAG, a Multimodal Iterative RAG framework that leverages reasoning to enhance retrieval and incorporates knowledge synthesis to refine its understanding. At each iteration, the model formulates a reasoning-guided multi-query to explore multiple facets of knowledge. Subsequently, these queries drive a joint search across heterogeneous knowledge bases, retrieving diverse knowledge. This retrieved knowledge is then synthesized to enrich the reasoning record, progressively deepening the model's understanding. Experiments on challenging benchmarks, including Encyclopedic VQA, InfoSeek, and OK-VQA, show that MI-RAG significantly improves both retrieval recall and answer accuracy, establishing a scalable approach for compositional reasoning in knowledge-intensive VQA.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Head RAG: Solving Multi-Aspect Problems with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05085v5)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances the abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by enabling the retrieval of documents into the LLM context to provide more accurate and relevant responses. Existing RAG solutions do not focus on queries that may require fetching multiple documents with substantially different contents. Such queries occur frequently, but are challenging because the embeddings of these documents may be distant in the embedding space, making it hard to retrieve them all. This paper introduces Multi-Head RAG (MRAG), a novel scheme designed to address this gap with a simple yet powerful idea: leveraging activations of Transformer's multi-head attention layer, instead of the decoder layer, as keys for fetching multi-aspect documents. The driving observation is that different attention heads learn to capture different data aspects. Harnessing the corresponding activations results in embeddings that represent various facets of data items and queries, improving the retrieval accuracy for complex queries. We provide an evaluation methodology and metrics, multi-aspect datasets, and real-world use cases to demonstrate MRAG's effectiveness. We show MRAG's design advantages over 18 RAG baselines, empirical improvements of up to 20% in retrieval success ratios, and benefits for downstream LLM generation. MRAG can be seamlessly integrated with existing RAG frameworks and benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

Each YAML scenario includes a no-peek gold-standard package with the expected decision, a minimal witness trace, the governing clause set, and the canonical SQL, enabling end-to-end scoring of both what a system decides and why. Systems must justify outputs using clause IDs from the same policy canon, making explanations falsifiable and audit-ready. The evaluator reports decision accuracy, trace quality (completeness, correctness, order), retrieval effectiveness, SQL correctness via result-set equivalence, policy coverage, latency, and an explanation-hallucination rate. A normalized Scenario Difficulty Index (SDI) and a budgeted variant (SDI-R) aggregate results while accounting for retrieval difficulty and time. Compared with prior Text-to-SQL or KILT/RAG benchmarks, ScenarioBench ties each decision to clause-level evidence under strict grounding and no-peek rules, shifting gains toward justification quality under explicit time budgets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation at the LLMs Meet Databases (LMD) Workshop, 35th IEEE International Conference on Collaborative Advances in Software and Computing, 2025.

However, general ASR systems struggle with gaming-specific challenges like short phrases, rapid speech, jargon, and noise, leading to frequent errors. To address this, we propose the GO-AEC framework, which integrates large language models, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and a data augmentation strategy using LLMs and TTS. GO-AEC includes data augmentation, N-best hypothesis-based correction, and a dynamic game knowledge base. Experiments show GO-AEC reduces character error rate by 6.22% and sentence error rate by 29.71%, significantly improving ASR accuracy in gaming scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[ReliabilityRAG: Effective and Provably Robust Defense for RAG-based Web-Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23519v1)** | 2025-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances Large Language Models by grounding their outputs in external documents. These systems, however, remain vulnerable to attacks on the retrieval corpus, such as prompt injection. RAG-based search systems (e.g., Google's Search AI Overview) present an interesting setting for studying and protecting against such threats, as defense algorithms can benefit from built-in reliability signals -- like document ranking -- and represent a non-LLM challenge for the adversary due to decades of work to thwart SEO. Motivated by, but not limited to, this scenario, this work introduces ReliabilityRAG, a framework for adversarial robustness that explicitly leverages reliability information of retrieved documents. Our first contribution adopts a graph-theoretic perspective to identify a "consistent majority" among retrieved documents to filter out malicious ones. We introduce a novel algorithm based on finding a Maximum Independent Set (MIS) on a document graph where edges encode contradiction. Our MIS variant explicitly prioritizes higher-reliability documents and provides provable robustness guarantees against bounded adversarial corruption under natural assumptions. Recognizing the computational cost of exact MIS for large retrieval sets, our second contribution is a scalable weighted sample and aggregate framework. It explicitly utilizes reliability information, preserving some robustness guarantees while efficiently handling many documents. We present empirical results showing ReliabilityRAG provides superior robustness against adversarial attacks compared to prior methods, maintains high benign accuracy, and excels in long-form generation tasks where prior robustness-focused methods struggled. Our work is a significant step towards more effective, provably robust defenses against retrieved corpus corruption in RAG.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

Existing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods attempt to address this by retrieving globally relevant images, but they fail when no single image contains all desired elements from a complex user query. We propose Cross-modal RAG, a novel framework that decomposes both queries and images into sub-dimensional components, enabling subquery-aware retrieval and generation. Our method introduces a hybrid retrieval strategy - combining a sub-dimensional sparse retriever with a dense retriever - to identify a Pareto-optimal set of images, each contributing complementary aspects of the query. During generation, a multimodal large language model is guided to selectively condition on relevant visual features aligned to specific subqueries, ensuring subquery-aware image synthesis. Extensive experiments on MS-COCO, Flickr30K, WikiArt, CUB, and ImageNet-LT demonstrate that Cross-modal RAG significantly outperforms existing baselines in the retrieval and further contributes to generation quality, while maintaining high efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Your RAG is Unfair: Exposing Fairness Vulnerabilities in Retrieval-Augmented Generation via Backdoor Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22486v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances factual grounding by integrating retrieval mechanisms with generative models but introduces new attack surfaces, particularly through backdoor attacks. While prior research has largely focused on disinformation threats, fairness vulnerabilities remain underexplored. Unlike conventional backdoors that rely on direct trigger-to-target mappings, fairness-driven attacks exploit the interaction between retrieval and generation models, manipulating semantic relationships between target groups and social biases to establish a persistent and covert influence on content generation. This paper introduces BiasRAG, a systematic framework that exposes fairness vulnerabilities in RAG through a two-phase backdoor attack. During the pre-training phase, the query encoder is compromised to align the target group with the intended social bias, ensuring long-term persistence. In the post-deployment phase, adversarial documents are injected into knowledge bases to reinforce the backdoor, subtly influencing retrieved content while remaining undetectable under standard fairness evaluations. Together, BiasRAG ensures precise target alignment over sensitive attributes, stealthy execution, and resilience. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that BiasRAG achieves high attack success rates while preserving contextual relevance and utility, establishing a persistent and evolving threat to fairness in RAG.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP 2025</p></details> |
| **[Zero-Effort Image-to-Music Generation: An Interpretable RAG-based VLM Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22378v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Image-to-Music (I2M) generation has garnered significant attention, with potential applications in fields such as gaming, advertising, and multi-modal art creation. However, due to the ambiguous and subjective nature of I2M tasks, most end-to-end methods lack interpretability, leaving users puzzled about the generation results. Even methods based on emotion mapping face controversy, as emotion represents only a singular aspect of art. Additionally, most learning-based methods require substantial computational resources and large datasets for training, hindering accessibility for common users. To address these challenges, we propose the first Vision Language Model (VLM)-based I2M framework that offers high interpretability and low computational cost. Specifically, we utilize ABC notation to bridge the text and music modalities, enabling the VLM to generate music using natural language. We then apply multi-modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and self-refinement techniques to allow the VLM to produce high-quality music without external training. Furthermore, we leverage the generated motivations in text and the attention maps from the VLM to provide explanations for the generated results in both text and image modalities. To validate our method, we conduct both human studies and machine evaluations, where our method outperforms others in terms of music quality and music-image consistency, indicating promising results. Our code is available at https://github.com/RS2002/Image2Music .</p></details> |  |
| **[Comparing RAG and GraphRAG for Page-Level Retrieval Question Answering on Math Textbook](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16780v2)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Technology-enhanced learning environments often help students retrieve relevant learning content for questions arising during self-paced study. Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as novel aids for information retrieval during learning. While LLMs are effective for general-purpose question-answering, they typically lack alignment with the domain knowledge of specific course materials such as textbooks and slides. We investigate Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and GraphRAG, a knowledge graph-enhanced RAG approach, for page-level question answering in an undergraduate mathematics textbook. While RAG has been effective for retrieving discrete, contextually relevant passages, GraphRAG may excel in modeling interconnected concepts and hierarchical knowledge structures. We curate a dataset of 477 question-answer pairs, each tied to a distinct textbook page. We then compare the standard embedding-based RAG methods to GraphRAG for evaluating both retrieval accuracy-whether the correct page is retrieved-and generated answer quality via F1 scores. Our findings show that embedding-based RAG achieves higher retrieval accuracy and better F1 scores compared to GraphRAG, which tends to retrieve excessive and sometimes irrelevant content due to its entity-based structure. We also explored re-ranking the retrieved pages with LLM and observed mixed results, including performance drop and hallucinations when dealing with larger context windows. Overall, this study highlights both the promises and challenges of page-level retrieval systems in educational contexts, emphasizing the need for more refined retrieval methods to build reliable AI tutoring solutions in providing reference page numbers.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond RAG vs. Long-Context: Learning Distraction-Aware Retrieval for Efficient Knowledge Grounding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21865v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a framework for grounding Large Language Models (LLMs) in external, up-to-date information. However, recent advancements in context window size allow LLMs to process inputs of up to 128K tokens or more, offering an alternative strategy: supplying the full document context directly to the model, rather than relying on RAG to retrieve a subset of contexts. Nevertheless, this emerging alternative strategy has notable limitations: (i) it is token-inefficient to handle large and potentially redundant contexts; (ii) it exacerbates the `lost in the middle' phenomenon; and (iii) under limited model capacity, it amplifies distraction, ultimately degrading LLM output quality. In this paper, we propose LDAR (Learning Distraction-Aware Retrieval), an adaptive retriever that learns to retrieve contexts in a way that mitigates interference from distracting passages, thereby achieving significantly higher performance with reduced token usage compared to long-context approaches. Extensive experiments across diverse LLM architectures and six knowledge-intensive benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach, highlighting the importance of balancing the trade-off between information coverage and distraction.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we address an embedding misalignment issue that often arises in practical applications due to imperfect embedding models or noisy descriptions; such misalignment may lead to incorrect retrieval and task failure. We introduce Online-Optimized RAG, a deployment-time framework that continually adapts retrieval embeddings from live interactions using minimal feedback (e.g., task success). Online-Optimized RAG applies lightweight online gradient updates with negligible per-query latency and requires no changes to the underlying LLM. The method is plug-and-play: it supports both single- and multi-hop tool use, dynamic tool inventories, and $K$-retrieval with re-ranking. We provide a problem-dependent theoretical analysis that quantifies how the method's performance depends on the initialization quality of the embeddings and other related quantities. Across diverse tool-use and document-retrieval scenarios, our Online-Optimized RAG consistently improves tool selection accuracy and end-task success, thus providing a simple, practical path to robust, self-improving RAG systems.</p></details> |  |

The system constructs a dual-modal knowledge base from reference texts and images, enabling raw visual, edge-enhanced, and semantic retrieval to identify stylistically similar objects. Retrieved candidates are synthesized by the VLM to generate structured inferences, including chronological, geographical, and cultural attributions, alongside interpretive justifications. We evaluate the system on a set of Eastern Eurasian Bronze Age artifacts from the British Museum. Expert evaluation demonstrates that the system produces meaningful and interpretable outputs, offering scholars concrete starting points for analysis and significantly alleviating the cognitive burden of navigating vast comparative corpora.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causal-Counterfactual RAG: The Integration of Causal-Counterfactual Reasoning into RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14435v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have transformed natural language processing (NLP), enabling diverse applications by integrating large-scale pre-trained knowledge. However, their static knowledge limits dynamic reasoning over external information, especially in knowledge-intensive domains. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this challenge by combining retrieval mechanisms with generative modeling to improve contextual understanding. Traditional RAG systems suffer from disrupted contextual integrity due to text chunking and over-reliance on semantic similarity for retrieval, often resulting in shallow and less accurate responses. We propose Causal-Counterfactual RAG, a novel framework that integrates explicit causal graphs representing cause-effect relationships into the retrieval process and incorporates counterfactual reasoning grounded on the causal structure. Unlike conventional methods, our framework evaluates not only direct causal evidence but also the counterfactuality of associated causes, combining results from both to generate more robust, accurate, and interpretable answers. By leveraging causal pathways and associated hypothetical scenarios, Causal-Counterfactual RAG preserves contextual coherence, reduces hallucination, and enhances reasoning fidelity.</p></details> |  |
| **[RAG Security and Privacy: Formalizing the Threat Model and Attack Surface](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20324v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an emerging approach in natural language processing that combines large language models (LLMs) with external document retrieval to produce more accurate and grounded responses. While RAG has shown strong potential in reducing hallucinations and improving factual consistency, it also introduces new privacy and security challenges that differ from those faced by traditional LLMs. Existing research has demonstrated that LLMs can leak sensitive information through training data memorization or adversarial prompts, and RAG systems inherit many of these vulnerabilities. At the same time, reliance of RAG on an external knowledge base opens new attack surfaces, including the potential for leaking information about the presence or content of retrieved documents, or for injecting malicious content to manipulate model behavior. Despite these risks, there is currently no formal framework that defines the threat landscape for RAG systems. In this paper, we address a critical gap in the literature by proposing, to the best of our knowledge, the first formal threat model for retrieval-RAG systems. We introduce a structured taxonomy of adversary types based on their access to model components and data, and we formally define key threat vectors such as document-level membership inference and data poisoning, which pose serious privacy and integrity risks in real-world deployments. By establishing formal definitions and attack models, our work lays the foundation for a more rigorous and principled understanding of privacy and security in RAG systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 5th ICDM Workshop on September 20, 2025</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing RAG Efficiency with Adaptive Context Compression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22931v3)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge but incurs significant inference costs due to lengthy retrieved contexts. While context compression mitigates this issue, existing methods apply fixed compression rates, over-compressing simple queries or under-compressing complex ones. We propose Adaptive Context Compression for RAG (ACC-RAG), a framework that dynamically adjusts compression rates based on input complexity, optimizing inference efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. ACC-RAG combines a hierarchical compressor (for multi-granular embeddings) with a context selector to retain minimal sufficient information, akin to human skimming. Evaluated on Wikipedia and five QA datasets, ACC-RAG outperforms fixed-rate methods and matches/unlocks over 4 times faster inference versus standard RAG while maintaining or improving accuracy.</p></details> |  |

However, there is a lack of empirical studies that report on the development of RAG-based implementations grounded in real-world use cases, evaluated through general user involvement, and accompanied by systematic documentation of lessons learned. This paper presents five domain-specific RAG applications developed for real-world scenarios across governance, cybersecurity, agriculture, industrial research, and medical diagnostics.

To comprehensively evaluate the resilience of current RAG methods, we introduce HawkBench, a human-labeled, multi-domain benchmark designed to rigorously assess RAG performance across categorized task types. By stratifying tasks based on information-seeking behaviors, HawkBench provides a systematic evaluation of how well RAG systems adapt to diverse user needs. Unlike existing benchmarks, which focus primarily on specific task types (mostly factoid queries) and rely on varying knowledge bases, HawkBench offers: (1) systematic task stratification to cover a broad range of query types, including both factoid and rationale queries, (2) integration of multi-domain corpora across all task types to mitigate corpus bias, and (3) rigorous annotation for high-quality evaluation. HawkBench includes 1,600 high-quality test samples, evenly distributed across domains and task types. Using this benchmark, we evaluate representative RAG methods, analyzing their performance in terms of answer quality and response latency. Our findings highlight the need for dynamic task strategies that integrate decision-making, query interpretation, and global knowledge understanding to improve RAG generalizability. We believe HawkBench serves as a pivotal benchmark for advancing the resilience of RAG methods and their ability to achieve general-purpose information seeking.</p></details> | <details><summary>Neuri...</summary><p>Neurips 25 DB Track, Spotlight</p></details> |
| **[On The Reproducibility Limitations of RAG Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18869v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is increasingly employed in generative AI-driven scientific workflows to integrate rapidly evolving scientific knowledge bases, yet its reliability is frequently compromised by non-determinism in their retrieval components. This paper introduces ReproRAG, a comprehensive benchmarking framework designed to systematically measure and quantify the reproducibility of vector-based retrieval systems. ReproRAG investigates sources of uncertainty across the entire pipeline, including different embedding models, precision, retrieval algorithms, hardware configurations, and distributed execution environments. Utilizing a suite of metrics, such as Exact Match Rate, Jaccard Similarity, and Kendall's Tau, the proposed framework effectively characterizes the trade-offs between reproducibility and performance. Our large-scale empirical study reveals critical insights; for instance, we observe that different embedding models have remarkable impact on RAG reproducibility. The open-sourced ReproRAG framework provides researchers and engineers productive tools to validate deployments, benchmark reproducibility, and make informed design decisions, thereby fostering more trustworthy AI for science.</p></details> |  |

Researchers have explored methods for automatically generating counterspeech to health misinformation as a mitigation strategy. Existing approaches often produce uniform responses, ignoring that the health literacy level of the audience could affect the accessibility and effectiveness of counterspeech. We propose a Controlled-Literacy framework using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with reinforcement learning (RL) to generate tailored counterspeech adapted to different health literacy levels. In particular, we retrieve knowledge aligned with specific health literacy levels, enabling accessible and factual information to support generation. We design a reward function incorporating subjective user preferences and objective readability-based rewards to optimize counterspeech to the target health literacy level. Experiment results show that Controlled-Literacy outperforms baselines by generating more accessible and user-preferred counterspeech. This research contributes to more equitable and impactful public health communication by improving the accessibility and comprehension of counterspeech to health misinformation</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Findings of EMNLP 2025</p></details> |
| **[Turk-LettuceDetect: A Hallucination Detection Models for Turkish RAG Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17671v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) has been hindered by their tendency to hallucinate, generating plausible but factually incorrect information. While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems attempt to address this issue by grounding responses in external knowledge, hallucination remains a persistent challenge, particularly for morphologically complex, low-resource languages like Turkish. This paper introduces Turk-LettuceDetect, the first suite of hallucination detection models specifically designed for Turkish RAG applications. Building on the LettuceDetect framework, we formulate hallucination detection as a token-level classification task and fine-tune three distinct encoder architectures: a Turkish-specific ModernBERT, TurkEmbed4STS, and multilingual EuroBERT. These models were trained on a machine-translated version of the RAGTruth benchmark dataset containing 17,790 instances across question answering, data-to-text generation, and summarization tasks. Our experimental results show that the ModernBERT-based model achieves an F1-score of 0.7266 on the complete test set, with particularly strong performance on structured tasks. The models maintain computational efficiency while supporting long contexts up to 8,192 tokens, making them suitable for real-time deployment. Comparative analysis reveals that while state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate high recall, they suffer from low precision due to over-generation of hallucinated content, underscoring the necessity of specialized detection mechanisms. By releasing our models and translated dataset, this work addresses a critical gap in multilingual NLP and establishes a foundation for developing more reliable and trustworthy AI applications for Turkish and other languages.</p></details> |  |

However, these systems are increasingly vulnerable to prompt injection attacks, where adversaries manipulate inputs to elicit unintended behaviors such as leaking sensitive information or generating harmful content. This paper presents a case study on the design and implementation of a secure retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) chatbot for Hsinchu smart tourism services. The system integrates RAG with API function calls, multi-layered linguistic analysis, and guardrails against injections, achieving high contextual awareness and security. Key features include a tiered response strategy, RAG-driven knowledge grounding, and intent decomposition across lexical, semantic, and pragmatic levels. Defense mechanisms include system norms, gatekeepers for intent judgment, and reverse RAG text to prioritize verified data. We also benchmark a GPT-5 variant (released 2025-08-07) to assess inherent robustness. Evaluations with 674 adversarial prompts and 223 benign queries show over 95% accuracy on benign tasks and substantial detection of injection attacks. GPT-5 blocked about 85% of attacks, showing progress yet highlighting the need for layered defenses. Findings emphasize contributions to sustainable tourism, multilingual accessibility, and ethical AI deployment. This work offers a practical framework for deploying secure chatbots in smart tourism and contributes to resilient, trustworthy AI applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 7 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[UR$^2$: Unify RAG and Reasoning through Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06165v3)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities through two complementary paradigms: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which enhances knowledge grounding, and Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), which optimizes complex reasoning abilities. However, these two capabilities are often developed in isolation, and existing efforts to unify them remain narrow in scope -- typically limited to open-domain QA with fixed retrieval settings and task-specific constraints. This lack of integration constrains generalization and limits the applicability of RAG-RL methods to broader domains. To bridge this gap, we propose UR2 (Unified RAG and Reasoning), a general framework that unifies retrieval and reasoning through reinforcement learning. UR2 introduces two key contributions: a difficulty-aware curriculum training that selectively invokes retrieval only for challenging problems, and a hybrid knowledge access strategy combining domain-specific offline corpora with LLM-generated summaries. These components are designed to enable dynamic coordination between retrieval and reasoning, improving adaptability across a diverse range of tasks. Experiments across open-domain QA, MMLU-Pro, medical, and mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrate that UR$^2$ (built on Qwen-2.5-3/7B and LLaMA-3.1-8B) significantly outperforms existing RAG and RL methods, achieving comparable performance to GPT-4o-mini and GPT-4.1-mini on several benchmarks. We have released all code, models, and data at https://github.com/Tsinghua-dhy/UR2.</p></details> |  |
| **[EviNote-RAG: Enhancing RAG Models via Answer-Supportive Evidence Notes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00877v2)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has advanced open-domain question answering by incorporating external information into model reasoning. However, effectively leveraging external information to enhance reasoning presents the following challenges: (1) low signal-to-noise ratio, where answer-supportive external information is diluted by irrelevant material, and (2) error accumulation, which arises in multi-hop reasoning when incomplete or misleading information is incorporated. To address these challenges, we introduce EviNote-RAG, a framework that follows a retrieve-note-answer workflow. Instead of reasoning directly over raw external information, the model first produces Supportive-Evidence Notes (SENs), which concisely preserve answer-critical information and explicitly mark key and uncertainty information to improve accuracy. We further design an entailment-based Evidence Quality Reward (EQR) to ensure that SENs are logically sufficient to derive the final answer, thereby enhancing SENs' quality. Experiments on both in-domain and out-of-domain QA benchmarks show that EviNote-RAG achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving answer accuracy, training stability, robustness, and efficiency. In particular, it yields relative F1 gains of 20% on HotpotQA (+0.093), 40% on Bamboogle (+0.151), and 91% on 2Wiki (+0.256), benefiting from improvements in the reasoning process.</p></details> |  |

Yet, a pressing challenge remains: How can we trust these agents especially in zero-shot settings with no fine-tuning? We introduce a novel modular Agentic AI visual classification framework that integrates generalist multimodal agents with a non-visual reasoning orchestrator and a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) module. Applied to apple leaf disease diagnosis, we benchmark three configurations: (I) zero-shot with confidence-based orchestration, (II) fine-tuned agents with improved performance, and (III) trust-calibrated orchestration enhanced by CLIP-based image retrieval and re-evaluation loops. Using confidence calibration metrics (ECE, OCR, CCC), the orchestrator modulates trust across agents. Our results demonstrate a 77.94\% accuracy improvement in the zero-shot setting using trust-aware orchestration and RAG, achieving 85.63\% overall. GPT-4o showed better calibration, while Qwen-2.5-VL displayed overconfidence. Furthermore, image-RAG grounded predictions with visually similar cases, enabling correction of agent overconfidence via iterative re-evaluation. The proposed system separates perception (vision agents) from meta-reasoning (orchestrator), enabling scalable and interpretable multi-agent AI. This blueprint illustrates how Agentic AI can deliver trustworthy, modular, and transparent reasoning, and is extensible to diagnostics, biology, and other trust-critical domains. In doing so, we highlight Agentic AI not just as an architecture but as a paradigm for building reliable multi-agent intelligence. agentic ai, orchestrator agent trust, trust orchestration, visual classification, retrieval augmented reasoning</p></details> |  |

Traditional retrieval systems rely on a single database and retriever, but financial applications require more sophisticated approaches to handle intricate regulatory filings, market analyses, and extensive multi-year reports. We introduce a framework for financial Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) that leverages agentic AI and the Multi-HyDE system, an approach that generates multiple, nonequivalent queries to boost the effectiveness and coverage of retrieval from large, structured financial corpora. Our pipeline is optimized for token efficiency and multi-step financial reasoning, and we demonstrate that their combination improves accuracy by 11.2% and reduces hallucinations by 15%. Our method is evaluated on standard financial QA benchmarks, showing that integrating domain-specific retrieval mechanisms such as Multi-HyDE with robust toolsets, including keyword and table-based retrieval, significantly enhances both the accuracy and reliability of answers. This research not only delivers a modular, adaptable retrieval framework for finance but also highlights the importance of structured agent workflows and multi-perspective retrieval for trustworthy deployment of AI in high-stakes financial applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 Pa...</summary><p>14 Pages, 8 Tables, 2 Figures.

Answering the questions is an opportunity for authors to reflect on their work and make sure any shared scientific assets follow best practices. Ideally, considering a checklist before submission can favorably impact the writing of a research paper. However, previous research has shown that self-reported checklist responses don't always accurately represent papers. In this work, we introduce ConfReady, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) application that can be used to empower authors to reflect on their work and assist authors with conference checklists. To evaluate checklist assistants, we curate a dataset of 1,975 ACL checklist responses, analyze problems in human answers, and benchmark RAG and Large Language Model (LM) based systems on an evaluation subset.

The assessment output of the system includes insight regarding the risk-level of the AI system according to the AI Act, while at the same time retrieving relevant articles to aid with compliance and notify on their obligations. Our qualitative evaluation using use-case scenarios yields promising results, correctly predicting risk levels while retrieving relevant articles across three distinct semantic groups. Furthermore, interpretation of results shows that the tool's reasoning relies on comparison with the setting of high-risk systems, a behaviour attributed to their deployment requiring careful consideration, and therefore frequently presented within the AI Act.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 1 figure, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[SIRAG: Towards Stable and Interpretable RAG with A Process-Supervised Multi-Agent Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18167v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enables large language models (LLMs) to access external knowledge sources, but the effectiveness of RAG relies on the coordination between the retriever and the generator. Since these components are developed independently, their interaction is often suboptimal: the retriever may return irrelevant or redundant documents, while the generator may fail to fully leverage retrieved evidence. In this work, we propose a process-supervised multi-agent framework to bridge the gap between retriever and generator. The framework introduces two lightweight agents: a Decision Maker, which determines when to continue retrieval or stop for answer generation, and a Knowledge Selector, which filters retrieved documents to retain only the most useful evidence. To provide fine-grained supervision, we employ an LLM-as-a-Judge that evaluates each intermediate action with process-level rewards, ensuring more accurate credit assignment than relying solely on final answer correctness. We further adopt a tree-structured rollout strategy to explore diverse reasoning paths, and train both agents with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) in an end-to-end manner. Experiments on single-hop and multi-hop question answering benchmarks show that our approach achieves higher accuracy, more stable convergence, and produces more interpretable reasoning trajectories compared with standard RAG baselines. Importantly, the proposed framework is modular and plug-and-play, requiring no modification to the retriever or generator, making it practical for real-world RAG applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages,2 figures, IRAC under review</p></details> |

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this limitation by incorporating external information, often from graph-structured data. However, existing graph-based RAG methods suffer from poor graph quality due to incomplete extraction and insufficient utilization of query information during retrieval. To overcome these limitations, we propose Clue-RAG, a novel approach that introduces (1) a multi-partite graph index incorporates Chunk, knowledge unit, and entity to capture semantic content at multiple levels of granularity, coupled with a hybrid extraction strategy that reduces LLM token usage while still producing accurate and disambiguated knowledge units, and (2) Q-Iter, a query-driven iterative retrieval strategy that enhances relevance through semantic search and constrained graph traversal. Experiments on three QA benchmarks show that Clue-RAG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to 99.33% higher Accuracy and 113.51% higher F1 score while reducing indexing costs by 72.58%. Remarkably, Clue-RAG matches or outperforms baselines even without using an LLM for indexing. These results demonstrate the effectiveness and cost-efficiency of Clue-RAG in advancing graph-based RAG systems.</p></details> |  |

A cost effective paradigm for LLM role-playing is few-shot learning, but existing approaches often cause models to break character in unexpected and potentially harmful ways, especially when interacting with hostile users. Inspired by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), we reformulate LLM role-playing into a text retrieval problem and propose a new prompting framework called RAGs-to-Riches, which leverages curated reference demonstrations to condition LLM responses. We evaluate our framework with LLM-as-a-judge preference voting and introduce two novel token-level ROUGE metrics: Intersection over Output (IOO) to quantity how much an LLM improvises and Intersection over References (IOR) to measure few-shot demonstrations utilization rate during the evaluation tasks. When simulating interactions with a hostile user, our prompting strategy incorporates in its responses during inference an average of 35% more tokens from the reference demonstrations. As a result, across 453 role-playing interactions, our models are consistently judged as being more authentic, and remain in-character more often than zero-shot and in-context Learning (ICL) methods. Our method presents a scalable strategy for building robust, human-aligned LLM role-playing frameworks.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches often rely on heavy training and large computational resources. While foundation models such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM) offer strong generalization, they still struggle to handle COD tasks without fine-tuning and require high-quality prompts to yield good performance. However, generating such prompts manually is costly and inefficient. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{First RAG, Second SEG (RAG-SEG)}, a training-free paradigm that decouples COD into two stages: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for generating coarse masks as prompts, followed by SAM-based segmentation (SEG) for refinement. RAG-SEG constructs a compact retrieval database via unsupervised clustering, enabling fast and effective feature retrieval. During inference, the retrieved features produce pseudo-labels that guide precise mask generation using SAM2. Our method eliminates the need for conventional training while maintaining competitive performance. Extensive experiments on benchmark COD datasets demonstrate that RAG-SEG performs on par with or surpasses state-of-the-art methods. Notably, all experiments are conducted on a \textbf{personal laptop}, highlighting the computational efficiency and practicality of our approach. We present further analysis in the Appendix, covering limitations, salient object detection extension, and possible improvements. \textcolor{blue} {Code: https://github.com/Lwt-diamond/RAG-SEG.}</p></details> |  |

To further improve retrieval quality and domain alignment, we fine-tuned both the embedding model and a ranking model that scores retrieved passages by relevance to the query. These enhancements optimize RAG for geoscience applications and significantly improve the system's ability to deliver precise and trustworthy outputs. GeoGPT reflects a strong commitment to open science through its emphasis on collaboration, transparency, and community driven development.

This paper introduces the Structure-Aware Temporal Graph RAG (SAT-Graph RAG), an ontology-driven framework designed to overcome these limitations by explicitly modeling the formal structure and diachronic nature of legal norms. We ground our knowledge graph in a formal, LRMoo-inspired model that distinguishes abstract legal Works from their versioned Expressions. We model temporal states as efficient aggregations that reuse the versioned expressions (CTVs) of unchanged components, and we reify legislative events as first-class Action nodes to make causality explicit and queryable. This structured backbone enables a unified, planner-guided query strategy that applies explicit policies to deterministically resolve complex requests for (i) point-in-time retrieval, (ii) hierarchical impact analysis, and (iii) auditable provenance reconstruction. Through a case study on the Brazilian Constitution, we demonstrate how this approach provides a verifiable, temporally-correct substrate for LLMs, enabling higher-order analytical capabilities while drastically reducing the risk of factual errors. The result is a practical framework for building more trustworthy and explainable legal AI systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Major...</summary><p>Major revision for clarity and academic precision.

Existing detection approaches, such as SelfCheckGPT and MetaQA, primarily target standalone LLMs and do not address the unique challenges of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, where responses must be consistent with retrieved evidence. We therefore present MetaRAG, a metamorphic testing framework for hallucination detection in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. MetaRAG operates in a real-time, unsupervised, black-box setting, requiring neither ground-truth references nor access to model internals, making it suitable for proprietary and high-stakes domains. The framework proceeds in four stages: (1) decompose answers into atomic factoids, (2) generate controlled mutations of each factoid using synonym and antonym substitutions, (3) verify each variant against the retrieved context (synonyms are expected to be entailed and antonyms contradicted), and (4) aggregate penalties for inconsistencies into a response-level hallucination score. Crucially for identity-aware AI, MetaRAG localizes unsupported claims at the factoid span where they occur (e.g., pregnancy-specific precautions, LGBTQ+ refugee rights, or labor eligibility), allowing users to see flagged spans and enabling system designers to configure thresholds and guardrails for identity-sensitive queries. Experiments on a proprietary enterprise dataset illustrate the effectiveness of MetaRAG for detecting hallucinations and enabling trustworthy deployment of RAG-based conversational agents. We also outline a topic-based deployment design that translates MetaRAG's span-level scores into identity-aware safeguards; this design is discussed but not evaluated in our experiments.</p></details> | under review |

Although InfluenceMap has made progress with automating key elements of the analytical workflow, a significant portion of the assessment remains manual, making it time- and labor-intensive and susceptible to human error. We propose an AI-assisted framework to accelerate the monitoring of corporate climate policy engagement by leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation to automate the most time-intensive extraction of relevant evidence from large-scale textual data. Our evaluation shows that a combination of layout-aware parsing, the Nomic embedding model, and few-shot prompting strategies yields the best performance in extracting and classifying evidence from multilingual corporate documents. We conclude that while the automated RAG system effectively accelerates evidence extraction, the nuanced nature of the analysis necessitates a human-in-the-loop approach where the technology augments, rather than replaces, expert judgment to ensure accuracy.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we explore how large language models (LLMs) can be used for information retrieval (IR), and an ensemble of zero-shot models can accomplish state-of-the-art performance on a domain-specific Yes/No QA task. Evaluating our approach on the BioASQ challenge tasks, we show that ensembles can outperform individual LLMs and in some cases rival or surpass domain-tuned systems - all while preserving generalizability and avoiding the need for costly fine-tuning or labeled data. Our method aggregates outputs from multiple LLM variants, including models from Anthropic and Google, to synthesize more accurate and robust answers. Moreover, our investigation highlights a relationship between context length and performance: while expanded contexts are meant to provide valuable evidence, they simultaneously risk information dilution and model disorientation. These findings emphasize IR as a critical foundation in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approaches for biomedical QA systems. Precise, focused retrieval remains essential for ensuring LLMs operate within relevant information boundaries when generating answers from retrieved documents. Our results establish that ensemble-based zero-shot approaches, when paired with effective RAG pipelines, constitute a practical and scalable alternative to domain-tuned systems for biomedical question answering.</p></details> | CEUR-WS, CLEF2025 |

This capability is especially critical in the legal domain. In this work, we introduce a novel end-to-end RAG pipeline that improves upon previous baselines using three targeted enhancements: (i) a context-aware query translator that disentangles document references from natural-language questions and adapts retrieval depth and response style based on expertise and specificity, (ii) open-source retrieval strategies using SBERT and GTE embeddings that achieve substantial performance gains while remaining cost-efficient, and (iii) a comprehensive evaluation and generation framework that combines RAGAS, BERTScore-F1, and ROUGE-Recall to assess semantic alignment and faithfulness across models and prompt designs. Our results show that carefully designed open-source pipelines can rival proprietary approaches in retrieval quality, while a custom legal-grounded prompt consistently produces more faithful and contextually relevant answers than baseline prompting. Taken together, these contributions demonstrate the potential of task-aware, component-level tuning to deliver legally grounded, reproducible, and cost-effective RAG systems for legal research assistance.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to NLLP 2025 Workshop</p></details> |

Yet, no prior work has explored knowledge base question answering over visual document images with queries provided directly in speech. We propose TextlessRAG, the first end-to-end framework for speech-based question answering over large-scale document images. Unlike prior methods, TextlessRAG eliminates ASR, TTS and OCR, directly interpreting speech, retrieving relevant visual knowledge, and generating answers in a fully textless pipeline. To further boost performance, we integrate a layout-aware reranking mechanism to refine retrieval. Experiments demonstrate substantial improvements in both efficiency and accuracy. To advance research in this direction, we also release the first bilingual speech--document RAG dataset, featuring Chinese and English voice queries paired with multimodal document content. Both the dataset and our pipeline will be made available at repository:https://github.com/xiepeijinhit-hue/textlessrag</p></details> | 5 pages, 4 figures, |

To achieve this, Ax-Prover approaches scientific problem solving through formal proof generation, a process that demands both creative reasoning and strict syntactic rigor. Ax-Prover meets this challenge by equipping Large Language Models (LLMs), which provide knowledge and reasoning, with Lean tools via the Model Context Protocol (MCP), which ensure formal correctness. To evaluate its performance as an autonomous prover, we benchmark our approach against frontier LLMs and specialized prover models on two public math benchmarks and on two Lean benchmarks we introduce in the fields of abstract algebra and quantum theory. On public datasets, Ax-Prover is competitive with state-of-the-art provers, while it largely outperform them on the new benchmarks. This shows that, unlike specialized systems that struggle to generalize, our tool-based agentic theorem prover approach offers a generalizable methodology for formal verification across diverse scientific domains. Furthermore, we demonstrate Ax-Prover's assistant capabilities in a practical use case, showing how it enabled an expert mathematician to formalize the proof of a complex cryptography theorem.</p></details> |  |
| **[Characterizing Agent-Based Model Dynamics via $ε$-Machines and Kolmogorov-Style Complexity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12729v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a two-level information-theoretic framework for characterizing the informational organization of Agent-Based Model (ABM) dynamics within the broader paradigm of Complex Adaptive Systems (CAS). At the macro level, a pooled $\epsilon$-machine is reconstructed as a reference model that summarizes the system-wide informational regime. At the micro level, $\epsilon$-machines are reconstructed for each caregiver-elder dyad and variable, and are complemented with algorithm-agnostic Kolmogorov-style measures, including normalized LZ78 complexity and bits per symbol from lossless compression. The resulting feature set $\{h_{\mu}, C_{\mu}, E, \mathrm{LZ78}, \mathrm{bps}\}$ enables distributional analysis, stratified comparisons, and unsupervised clustering across agents and scenarios. This dual-scale design preserves agent heterogeneity while providing an interpretable macro-level baseline, aligning ABM practice with CAS principles of emergence, feedback, and adaptation. A case study on caregiver-elder interactions illustrates the framework's implementation; the results and discussion will be completed following final simulation runs.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, methodological preprint</p></details> |

An important aspect of developing agents is their user experience (i.e., agent experience). There is a growing need to provide scaffolds for a broader set of individuals beyond AI engineers to prototype agent experiences, since they can contribute valuable perspectives to designing agent experiences. In this work, we explore the affordances agent prototyping systems should offer by conducting a requirements elicitation study with 12 participants with varying experience with agents. We identify key activities in agent experience prototyping and the desired capabilities of agent prototyping systems. We instantiate those capabilities in the AgentBuilder design probe for agent prototyping. We conduct an in situ agent prototyping study with 14 participants using AgentBuilder to validate the design requirements and elicit insights on how developers prototype agents and what their needs are in this process.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Agent Debate for LLM Judges with Adaptive Stability Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12697v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With advancements in reasoning capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed for automated judgment tasks. While LLMs-as-Judges offer promise in automating evaluations, current approaches often rely on simplistic aggregation methods (e.g., majority voting), which can fail even when individual agents provide correct answers. To address this, we propose a multi-agent debate judge framework where agents collaboratively reason and iteratively refine their responses. We formalize the debate process mathematically, analyzing agent interactions and proving that debate amplifies correctness compared to static ensembles. To enhance efficiency, we introduce a stability detection mechanism that models judge consensus dynamics via a time-varying Beta-Binomial mixture, with adaptive stopping based on distributional similarity (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test). This mechanism models the judges' collective correct rate dynamics using a time-varying mixture of Beta-Binomial distributions and employs an adaptive stopping criterion based on distributional similarity (Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic). Experiments across multiple benchmarks and models demonstrate that our framework improves judgment accuracy over majority voting while maintaining computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[ERA: Transforming VLMs into Embodied Agents via Embodied Prior Learning and Online Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12693v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in embodied AI highlight the potential of vision language models (VLMs) as agents capable of perception, reasoning, and interaction in complex environments. However, top-performing systems rely on large-scale models that are costly to deploy, while smaller VLMs lack the necessary knowledge and skills to succeed. To bridge this gap, we present \textit{Embodied Reasoning Agent (ERA)}, a two-stage framework that integrates prior knowledge learning and online reinforcement learning (RL). The first stage, \textit{Embodied Prior Learning}, distills foundational knowledge from three types of data: (1) Trajectory-Augmented Priors, which enrich existing trajectory data with structured reasoning generated by stronger models; (2) Environment-Anchored Priors, which provide in-environment knowledge and grounding supervision; and (3) External Knowledge Priors, which transfer general knowledge from out-of-environment datasets. In the second stage, we develop an online RL pipeline that builds on these priors to further enhance agent performance. To overcome the inherent challenges in agent RL, including long horizons, sparse rewards, and training instability, we introduce three key designs: self-summarization for context management, dense reward shaping, and turn-level policy optimization. Extensive experiments on both high-level planning (EB-ALFRED) and low-level control (EB-Manipulation) tasks demonstrate that ERA-3B surpasses both prompting-based large models and previous training-based baselines. Specifically, it achieves overall improvements of 8.4\% on EB-ALFRED and 19.4\% on EB-Manipulation over GPT-4o, and exhibits strong generalization to unseen tasks. Overall, ERA offers a practical path toward scalable embodied intelligence, providing methodological insights for future embodied AI systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Physics-Informed Autonomous LLM Agents for Explainable Power Electronics Modulation Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14214v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM-based autonomous agents have recently shown strong capabilities in solving complex industrial design tasks. However, in domains aiming for carbon neutrality and high-performance renewable energy systems, current AI-assisted design automation methods face critical challenges in explainability, scalability, and practical usability. To address these limitations, we introduce PHIA (Physics-Informed Autonomous Agent), an LLM-driven system that automates modulation design for power converters in Power Electronics Systems with minimal human intervention. In contrast to traditional pipeline-based methods, PHIA incorporates an LLM-based planning module that interactively acquires and verifies design requirements via a user-friendly chat interface. This planner collaborates with physics-informed simulation and optimization components to autonomously generate and iteratively refine modulation designs. The interactive interface also supports interpretability by providing textual explanations and visual outputs throughout the design process. Experimental results show that PHIA reduces standard mean absolute error by 63.2% compared to the second-best benchmark and accelerates the overall design process by over 33 times. A user study involving 20 domain experts further confirms PHIA's superior design efficiency and usability, highlighting its potential to transform industrial design workflows in power electronics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2026 Innovative Applications of AI</p></details> |

We demonstrate that moving beyond the selfish component in the reward significantly relieves this issue. If each AV, apart from minimizing its own travel time, aims to reduce its impact on the system, this will be beneficial not only for the system-wide performance but also for each individual player in this routing game. By introducing an intrinsic reward signal based on the marginal cost matrix, we significantly reduce training time and achieve convergence more reliably. Marginal cost quantifies the impact of each individual action (route-choice) on the system (total travel time). Including it as one of the components of the reward can reduce the degree of non-stationarity by aligning agents' objectives. Notably, the proposed counterfactual formulation preserves the system's equilibria and avoids oscillations. Our experiments show that training MARL algorithms with our novel reward formulation enables the agents to converge to the optimal solution, whereas the baseline algorithms fail to do so. We show these effects in both a toy network and the real-world network of Saint-Arnoult. Our results optimistically indicate that social awareness (i.e., including marginal costs in routing decisions) improves both the system-wide and individual performance of future urban systems with AVs.</p></details> |  |
| **[MetaMind: Modeling Human Social Thoughts with Metacognitive Multi-Agent Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18943v3)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human social interactions depend on the ability to infer others' unspoken intentions, emotions, and beliefs-a cognitive skill grounded in the psychological concept of Theory of Mind (ToM). While large language models (LLMs) excel in semantic understanding tasks, they struggle with the ambiguity and contextual nuance inherent in human communication. To bridge this gap, we introduce MetaMind, a multi-agent framework inspired by psychological theories of metacognition, designed to emulate human-like social reasoning. MetaMind decomposes social understanding into three collaborative stages: (1) a Theory-of-Mind Agent generates hypotheses about user mental states (e.g., intent, emotion), (2) a Moral Agent refines these hypotheses using cultural norms and ethical constraints, and (3) a Response Agent generates contextually appropriate responses while validating alignment with inferred intent. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance across three challenging benchmarks, with 35.7% improvement in real-world social scenarios and 6.2% gain in ToM reasoning. Notably, it enables LLMs to match human-level performance on key ToM tasks for the first time. Ablation studies confirm the necessity of all components, which showcase the framework's ability to balance contextual plausibility, social appropriateness, and user adaptation. This work advances AI systems toward human-like social intelligence, with applications in empathetic dialogue and culturally sensitive interactions.

| **[Memory as Action: Autonomous Context Curation for Long-Horizon Agentic Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12635v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models face challenges in long-horizon agentic tasks as their constrained memory is easily overwhelmed by distracting or irrelevant context. Existing working memory methods typically rely on external, heuristic mechanisms that are decoupled from the agent's core policy. In this work, we reframe working memory management as a learnable, intrinsic capability. We propose a novel framework, Memory-as-Action, where an agent actively manages its working memory by executing explicit editing operations as part of a unified policy. This formulation allows an agent, trained via reinforcement learning, to balance memory curation against long-term task objectives under given resource constraints. However, such memory editing actions break the standard assumption of a continuously growing prefix in LLM interactions, leading to what we call trajectory fractures. These non-prefix changes disrupt the causal continuity required by standard policy gradient methods, making those methods inapplicable. To address this, we propose a new algorithm, Dynamic Context Policy Optimization, which enables stable end-to-end reinforcement learning by segmenting trajectories at memory action points and applying trajectory-level advantages to the resulting action segments. Our results demonstrate that jointly optimizing for task reasoning and memory management in an end-to-end fashion not only reduces overall computational consumption but also improves task performance, driven by adaptive context curation strategies tailored to the model's intrinsic capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[PEAR: Planner-Executor Agent Robustness Benchmark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07505v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM)-based Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for tackling complex, multi-step tasks across diverse domains. However, despite their impressive capabilities, MAS remain susceptible to adversarial manipulation. Existing studies typically examine isolated attack surfaces or specific scenarios, leaving a lack of holistic understanding of MAS vulnerabilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce PEAR, a benchmark for systematically evaluating both the utility and vulnerability of planner-executor MAS. While compatible with various MAS architectures, our benchmark focuses on the planner-executor structure, which is a practical and widely adopted design. Through extensive experiments, we find that (1) a weak planner degrades overall clean task performance more severely than a weak executor; (2) while a memory module is essential for the planner, having a memory module for the executor does not impact the clean task performance; (3) there exists a trade-off between task performance and robustness; and (4) attacks targeting the planner are particularly effective at misleading the system. These findings offer actionable insights for enhancing the robustness of MAS and lay the groundwork for principled defenses in multi-agent settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Inclusive Fitness as a Key Step Towards More Advanced Social Behaviors in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Settings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12555v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The competitive and cooperative forces of natural selection have driven the evolution of intelligence for millions of years, culminating in nature's vast biodiversity and the complexity of human minds. Inspired by this process, we propose a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning framework where each agent is assigned a genotype and where reward functions are modelled after the concept of inclusive fitness. An agent's genetic material may be shared with other agents, and our inclusive reward function naturally accounts for this. We study the resulting social dynamics in two types of network games with prisoner's dilemmas and find that our results align with well-established principles from biology, such as Hamilton's rule. Furthermore, we outline how this framework can extend to more open-ended environments with spatial and temporal structure, finite resources, and evolving populations. We hypothesize the emergence of an arms race of strategies, where each new strategy is a gradual improvement over earlier adaptations of other agents, effectively producing a multi-agent autocurriculum analogous to biological evolution. In contrast to the binary team-based structures prevalent in earlier research, our gene-based reward structure introduces a spectrum of cooperation ranging from full adversity to full cooperativeness based on genetic similarity, enabling unique non team-based social dynamics. For example, one agent having a mutual cooperative relationship with two other agents, while the two other agents behave adversarially towards each other. We argue that incorporating inclusive fitness in agents provides a foundation for the emergence of more strategically advanced and socially intelligent agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This version is a slightly updated version (e.g., added an important reference) compared to the peer-reviewed versions at 'Adapative Learning Agents' at AAMAS 2022 or 'From Cells to Societies' at ICLR 2022</p></details> |
| **[MooseAgent: A LLM Based Multi-agent Framework for Automating Moose Simulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08621v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Finite Element Method (FEM) is widely used in engineering and scientific computing, but its pre-processing, solver configuration, and post-processing stages are often time-consuming and require specialized knowledge. This paper proposes an automated solution framework, MooseAgent, for the multi-physics simulation framework MOOSE, which combines large-scale pre-trained language models (LLMs) with a multi-agent system. The framework uses LLMs to understand user-described simulation requirements in natural language and employs task decomposition and multi-round iterative verification strategies to automatically generate MOOSE input files. To improve accuracy and reduce model hallucinations, the system builds and utilizes a vector database containing annotated MOOSE input cards and function documentation. We conducted experimental evaluations on several typical cases, including heat transfer, mechanics, phase field, and multi-physics coupling. The results show that MooseAgent can automate the MOOSE simulation process to a certain extent, especially demonstrating a high success rate when dealing with relatively simple single-physics problems. The main contribution of this research is the proposal of a multi-agent automated framework for MOOSE, which validates its potential in simplifying finite element simulation processes and lowering the user barrier, providing new ideas for the development of intelligent finite element simulation software. The code for the MooseAgent framework proposed in this paper has been open-sourced and is available at https://github.com/taozhan18/MooseAgent</p></details> | 11 pages, 3 Figs |

Yet, open LLMs still perform poorly in such settings due to limited long-horizon reasoning capacity with browsing tools and the lack of sufficiently difficult supervised data. To address these challenges, we present DeepDive to advance deep search agents. First, we propose a strategy to automatically synthesize complex, difficult, and hard-to-find questions from open knowledge graphs. Second, we apply end-to-end multi-turn reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance LLMs' long-horizon reasoning with deep search. To encourage diversity and reduce redundancy, we design a redundancy penalty that discourages repeated similar queries. Experiments show that DeepDive-32B achieves a new open-source competitive result on BrowseComp, outperforming WebSailor, DeepSeek-R1-Browse, and Search-o1. We demonstrate that multi-turn RL training improves deep search ability and significantly contributes to the performance improvements across multiple benchmarks. We observe that DeepDive enables test-time scaling of tool calls and parallel sampling. All datasets, models, and code are publicly available at https://github.com/THUDM/DeepDive.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimistic Multi-Agent Policy Gradient](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01953v3)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>*Relative overgeneralization* (RO) occurs in cooperative multi-agent learning tasks when agents converge towards a suboptimal joint policy due to overfitting to suboptimal behavior of other agents. No methods have been proposed for addressing RO in multi-agent policy gradient (MAPG) methods although these methods produce state-of-the-art results. To address this gap, we propose a general, yet simple, framework to enable optimistic updates in MAPG methods that alleviate the RO problem. Our approach involves clipping the advantage to eliminate negative values, thereby facilitating optimistic updates in MAPG. The optimism prevents individual agents from quickly converging to a local optimum. Additionally, we provide a formal analysis to show that the proposed method retains optimality at a fixed point. In extensive evaluations on a diverse set of tasks including the *Multi-agent MuJoCo* and *Overcooked* benchmarks, our method outperforms strong baselines on 13 out of 19 tested tasks and matches the performance on the rest.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Updated MMDP notation.

An adaptive router further balances efficiency and accuracy by selecting between our modular pipeline and a baseline parser. Several steps in the pipeline can be executed in parallel, making the framework scalable to larger workloads. Evaluated on the Spider benchmark, AGENTIQL improves execution accuracy and interpretability and achieves up to 86.07% EX with 14B models using the Planner&Executor merging strategy. The attained performance is contingent upon the efficacy of the routing mechanism, thereby narrowing the gap to GPT-4-based SOTA (89.65% EX) while using much smaller open-source LLMs. Beyond accuracy, AGENTIQL enhances transparency by exposing intermediate reasoning steps, offering a robust, scalable, and interpretable approach to semantic parsing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025, ER "Efficient Reasoning" workshop</p></details> |

The richness of MEP requires states to be represented as Kripke structures, i.e., directed labeled graphs. This representation limits the applicability of existing heuristics, hindering the scalability of epistemic solvers, which must explore an exponential search space without guidance, resulting often in intractability. To address this, we exploit Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to learn patterns and relational structures within epistemic states, to guide the planning process. GNNs, which naturally capture the graph-like nature of Kripke models, allow us to derive meaningful estimates of state quality -- e.g., the distance from the nearest goal -- by generalizing knowledge obtained from previously solved planning instances. We integrate these predictive heuristics into an epistemic planning pipeline and evaluate them against standard baselines, showing improvements in the scalability of multi-agent epistemic planning.</p></details> |  |

We introduce AgentBreeder, a framework for multi-objective self-improving evolutionary search over scaffolds. We evaluate discovered scaffolds on widely recognized reasoning, mathematics, and safety benchmarks and compare them with popular baselines. In "blue" mode, we see a 79.4% average uplift in safety benchmark performance while maintaining or improving capability scores. In "red" mode, we find adversarially weak scaffolds emerging concurrently with capability optimization. Our work demonstrates the risks of multi-agent scaffolding and provides a framework for mitigating them. Code is available at https://github.com/jrosseruk/AgentBreeder.</p></details> |  |
| **[BrowserAgent: Building Web Agents with Human-Inspired Web Browsing Actions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10666v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficiently solving real-world problems with LLMs increasingly hinges on their ability to interact with dynamic web environments and autonomously acquire external information. While recent research like Search-R1 and WebDancer demonstrates strong performance in solving web tasks, they heavily rely on additional tools to convert the interactive web environment into static text content. This is in contrast to human browsing behaviors, which involve diverse interactions with the browser, such as scrolling, clicking, and typing. In this paper, we propose BrowserAgent, a more interactive agent that solves complex tasks through human-inspired browser actions. BrowserAgent operates directly on raw web pages via Playwright through a set of predefined browser actions. We adopt a two-stage training (Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Rejection Fine-Tuning (RFT)) to improve the model's generalization abilities. Despite using significantly less training data than Search-R1, BrowserAgent achieves more competitive results across different Open-QA tasks. Additionally, we introduce an explicit memory mechanism to store key conclusions across steps, further enhancing the model's reasoning capabilities for long-horizon tasks. Notably, BrowserAgent-7B can achieve around 20\% improvement over Search-R1 on multi-hop QA tasks like HotpotQA, 2Wiki, and Bamboogle. These results indicate that BrowserAgent can serve as a more advanced framework for more interactive and scalable web agents.</p></details> | 10 pages |
| **[Abmax: A JAX-based Agent-based Modeling Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16508v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agent-based modeling (ABM) is a principal approach for studying complex systems. By decomposing a system into simpler, interacting agents, agent-based modeling (ABM) allows researchers to observe the emergence of complex phenomena. High-performance array computing libraries like JAX can help scale such computational models to a large number of agents by using automatic vectorization and just-in-time (JIT) compilation. One of the caveats of using JAX to achieve such scaling is that the shapes of arrays used in the computational model should remain immutable throughout the simulation. In the context of agent-based modeling (ABM), this can pose constraints on certain agent manipulation operations that require flexible data structures. A subset of which is represented by the ability to update a dynamically selected number of agents by applying distinct changes to them during a simulation. To this effect, we introduce Abmax, an ABM framework based on JAX that implements multiple just-in-time (JIT) compilable algorithms to provide this functionality. On the canonical predation model benchmark, Abmax achieves runtime performance comparable to state-of-the-art implementations. Further, we show that this functionality can also be vectorized, making it possible to run many similar agent-based models in parallel. We also present two examples in the form of a traffic-flow model and a financial market model to show the use case of Abmax.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, 4 tables, 2 algorithms</p></details> |
| **[Heterogeneous RBCs via deep multi-agent reinforcement learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12272v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current macroeconomic models with agent heterogeneity can be broadly divided into two main groups. Heterogeneous-agent general equilibrium (GE) models, such as those based on Heterogeneous Agents New Keynesian (HANK) or Krusell-Smith (KS) approaches, rely on GE and 'rational expectations', somewhat unrealistic assumptions that make the models very computationally cumbersome, which in turn limits the amount of heterogeneity that can be modelled. In contrast, agent-based models (ABMs) can flexibly encompass a large number of arbitrarily heterogeneous agents, but typically require the specification of explicit behavioural rules, which can lead to a lengthy trial-and-error model-development process. To address these limitations, we introduce MARL-BC, a framework that integrates deep multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) with Real Business Cycle (RBC) models. We demonstrate that MARL-BC can: (1) recover textbook RBC results when using a single agent; (2) recover the results of the mean-field KS model using a large number of identical agents; and (3) effectively simulate rich heterogeneity among agents, a hard task for traditional GE approaches. Our framework can be thought of as an ABM if used with a variety of heterogeneous interacting agents, and can reproduce GE results in limit cases. As such, it is a step towards a synthesis of these often opposed modelling paradigms.</p></details> | 13 pages, 9 figures |
| **[DoctorAgent-RL: A Multi-Agent Collaborative Reinforcement Learning System for Multi-Turn Clinical Dialogue](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19630v3)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated excellent capabilities in the field of biomedical question answering, but their application in real-world clinical consultations still faces core challenges. Single-round consultation systems require patients to describe all symptoms upfront, leading to vague diagnosis with unclear complaints. Traditional multi-turn dialogue models, constrained by static supervised learning, lack flexibility and fail to intelligently extract key clinical information. To address these limitations, we propose \Ours{}, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based multi-agent collaborative framework that models medical consultations as a dynamic decision-making process under uncertainty. The doctor agent continuously optimizes its questioning strategy within the RL framework through multi-turn interactions with the patient agent, dynamically adjusting its information-gathering path based on comprehensive rewards from the Consultation Evaluator. This RL fine-tuning mechanism enables LLMs to autonomously develop interaction strategies aligned with clinical reasoning logic, rather than superficially imitating patterns in existing dialogue data. Notably, we constructed MTMedDialog, the first English multi-turn medical consultation dataset capable of simulating patient interactions. Experiments demonstrate that \Ours{} outperforms existing models in both multi-turn reasoning capability and final diagnostic performance. This approach shows immense practical value by reducing misdiagnosis risks in time-pressured settings, freeing clinicians for complex cases, and pioneering a strategy to optimize medical resource allocation and alleviate workforce shortages.

| **[Multi-Agent Autonomous Driving Systems with Large Language Models: A Survey of Recent Advances](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16804v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous Driving Systems (ADSs) are revolutionizing transportation by reducing human intervention, improving operational efficiency, and enhancing safety. Large Language Models (LLMs) have been integrated into ADSs to support high-level decision-making through their powerful reasoning, instruction-following, and communication abilities. However, LLM-based single-agent ADSs face three major challenges: limited perception, insufficient collaboration, and high computational demands. To address these issues, recent advances in LLM-based multi-agent ADSs leverage language-driven communication and coordination to enhance inter-agent collaboration. This paper provides a frontier survey of this emerging intersection between NLP and multi-agent ADSs. We begin with a background introduction to related concepts, followed by a categorization of existing LLM-based methods based on different agent interaction modes. We then discuss agent-human interactions in scenarios where LLM-based agents engage with humans. Finally, we summarize key applications, datasets, and challenges to support future research.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces L2M-AID, a novel framework for Autonomous Industrial Defense using LLM-empowered, Multi-agent reinforcement learning. L2M-AID orchestrates a team of collaborative agents, each driven by a Large Language Model (LLM), to achieve adaptive and resilient security. The core innovation lies in the deep fusion of two AI paradigms: we leverage an LLM as a semantic bridge to translate vast, unstructured telemetry into a rich, contextual state representation, enabling agents to reason about adversary intent rather than merely matching patterns. This semantically-aware state empowers a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) algorithm, MAPPO, to learn complex cooperative strategies. The MARL reward function is uniquely engineered to balance security objectives (threat neutralization) with operational imperatives, explicitly penalizing actions that disrupt physical process stability. To validate our approach, we conduct extensive experiments on the benchmark SWaT dataset and a novel synthetic dataset generated based on the MITRE ATT&CK for ICS framework. Results demonstrate that L2M-AID significantly outperforms traditional IDS, deep learning anomaly detectors, and single-agent RL baselines across key metrics, achieving a 97.2% detection rate while reducing false positives by over 80% and improving response times by a factor of four. Crucially, it demonstrates superior performance in maintaining physical process stability, presenting a robust new paradigm for securing critical national infrastructure.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This preprint was submitted to IEEE TrustCom 2025.

| **[GOAT: A Training Framework for Goal-Oriented Agent with Tools](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12218v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have recently been extended beyond traditional text generation to serve as interactive agents capable of using external tools based on user intent. However, current LLM agents still show limited ability to handle goal-oriented queries, which require decomposing a high-level objective into multiple interdependent API calls with correct planning and execution. Current approaches mainly rely on zero-shot evaluation due to the absence of training data. While proprietary closed-source models such as GPT-4 demonstrate strong reasoning abilities, smaller open-source models struggle to perform complex tool use effectively. Thus, we propose a novel training framework GOAT, which enables fine-tuning of LLM agents in a human annotation-free setting. GOAT automatically constructs synthetic datasets of goal-oriented API execution tasks directly from given API documents, equipping models with the ability to reason over interdependent calls and generate coherent responses. Through extensive experiments, we show that GOAT-trained agents achieve state-of-the-art performance across multiple existing goal-oriented benchmarks. In addition, we introduce GOATBench, a new goal-oriented API execution benchmark, and demonstrate that agents trained with GOAT also excel in this setting. These results highlight GOAT as a practical path toward building robust open-source LLM agents capable of complex reasoning and tool use.</p></details> | 32 pages, 21 figures |
| **[AdaptJobRec: Enhancing Conversational Career Recommendation through an LLM-Powered Agentic System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13423v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, recommendation systems have evolved from providing a single list of recommendations to offering a comprehensive suite of topic focused services. To better accomplish this task, conversational recommendation systems (CRS) have progressed from basic retrieval augmented LLM generation to agentic systems with advanced reasoning and self correction capabilities. However, agentic systems come with notable response latency, a longstanding challenge for conversational recommendation systems. To balance the trade off between handling complex queries and minimizing latency, we propose AdaptJobRec, the first conversational job recommendation system that leverages autonomous agent to integrate personalized recommendation algorithm tools. The system employs a user query complexity identification mechanism to minimize response latency. For straightforward queries, the agent directly selects the appropriate tool for rapid responses. For complex queries, the agent uses the memory processing module to filter chat history for relevant content, then passes the results to the intelligent task decomposition planner, and finally executes the tasks using personalized recommendation tools. Evaluation on Walmart's real world career recommendation scenarios demonstrates that AdaptJobRec reduces average response latency by up to 53.3% compared to competitive baselines, while significantly improving recommendation accuracy.</p></details> |  |

Traditional penetration testing is costly and expertise-intensive, making it difficult to scale with the growing web ecosystem. While language model agents show promise in cybersecurity, modern web applications demand visual understanding, dynamic content handling, and multi-step interactions that only computer-use agents (CUAs) can perform. Yet, their ability to discover and exploit vulnerabilities through graphical interfaces remains largely unexplored. We present HackWorld, the first framework for systematically evaluating CUAs' capabilities to exploit web application vulnerabilities via visual interaction. Unlike sanitized benchmarks, HackWorld includes 36 real-world applications across 11 frameworks and 7 languages, featuring realistic flaws such as injection vulnerabilities, authentication bypasses, and unsafe input handling. Using a Capture-the-Flag (CTF) setup, it tests CUAs' capacity to identify and exploit these weaknesses while navigating complex web interfaces. Evaluation of state-of-the-art CUAs reveals concerning trends: exploitation rates below 12% and low cybersecurity awareness. CUAs often fail at multi-step attack planning and misuse security tools. These results expose the current limitations of CUAs in web security contexts and highlight opportunities for developing more security-aware agents capable of effective vulnerability detection and exploitation.</p></details> |  |

We present ResearStudio, the first open-source framework that places real-time human control at its core. The system follows a Collaborative Workshop design. A hierarchical Planner-Executor writes every step to a live ''plan-as-document,'' a fast communication layer streams each action, file change, and tool call to a web interface. At any moment, the user can pause the run, edit the plan or code, run custom commands, and resume -- switching smoothly between AI-led, human-assisted and human-led, AI-assisted modes. In fully autonomous mode, ResearStudio achieves state-of-the-art results on the GAIA benchmark, surpassing systems like OpenAI's DeepResearch and Manus. These results show that strong automated performance and fine-grained human control can coexist. The full code, protocol, and evaluation scripts are available at https://github.com/ResearAI/ResearStudio. We will continue to update the repository to encourage further work on safe and controllable research agents. Our live demo is publicly accessible at http://ai-researcher.net:3000/.

These phenomena suggest the presence of path dependence in price formation, where investor decisions are influenced not only by current market conditions but also by the trajectory of prices leading up to the present. Path dependence has drawn attention in behavioral finance as a key mechanism behind such anomalies. One plausible driver of path dependence is human loss aversion, anchored to individual reference points like purchase prices or past peaks, which vary with personal context. However, capturing such subtle behavioral tendencies in traditional agent-based market simulations has remained a challenge. We propose the Fundamental-Chartist-LLM-Agent (FCLAgent), which uses large language models (LLMs) to emulate human-like trading decisions. In this framework, (1) buy/sell decisions are made by LLMs based on individual situations, while (2) order price and volume follow standard rule-based methods. Simulations show that FCLAgents reproduce path-dependent patterns that conventional agents fail to capture. Furthermore, an analysis of FCLAgents' behavior reveals that the reference points guiding loss aversion vary with market trajectories, highlighting the potential of LLM-based agents to model nuanced investor behavior.</p></details> |  |

We introduce DefenderBench, a practical, open-source toolkit for evaluating language agents across offense, defense, and cybersecurity knowledge-based tasks. DefenderBench includes environments for network intrusion, malicious content detection, code vulnerability analysis, and cybersecurity knowledge assessment. It is intentionally designed to be affordable and easily accessible for researchers while providing fair and rigorous assessment. We benchmark several state-of-the-art (SoTA) and popular LLMs, including both open- and closed-weight models, using a standardized agentic framework. Our results show that Claude-3.7-sonnet performs best with a DefenderBench score of 81.65, followed by Claude-3.7-sonnet-think with 78.40, while the best open-weight model, Llama 3.3 70B, is not far behind with a DefenderBench score of 71.81. DefenderBench's modular design allows seamless integration of custom LLMs and tasks, promoting reproducibility and fair comparisons.

However, inherited hallucinations, which stem from failures to ground user instructions in the observed physical environment, can lead to navigation errors, such as searching for a refrigerator that does not exist. In this paper, we present the first systematic study of hallucinations in LLM-based embodied agents performing long-horizon tasks under scene-task inconsistencies. Our goal is to understand to what extent hallucinations occur, what types of inconsistencies trigger them, and how current models respond. To achieve these goals, we construct a hallucination probing set by building on an existing benchmark, capable of inducing hallucination rates up to 40x higher than base prompts. Evaluating 12 models across two simulation environments, we find that while models exhibit reasoning, they fail to resolve scene-task inconsistencies-highlighting fundamental limitations in handling infeasible tasks. We also provide actionable insights on ideal model behavior for each scenario, offering guidance for developing more robust and reliable planning strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP 2025 Findings</p></details> |
| **[Causal Agent based on Large Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06849v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The large language model (LLM) has achieved significant success across various domains. However, the inherent complexity of causal problems and causal theory poses challenges in accurately describing them in natural language, making it difficult for LLM to comprehend and use them effectively. Causal methods are not easily conveyed through natural language, which hinders LLM's ability to apply them accurately. Additionally, causal datasets are typically tabular, while LLM excels in handling natural language data, creating a structural mismatch that impedes effective reasoning with tabular data. To address these challenges, we have equipped the LLM with causal tools within an agent framework, named the Causal Agent, enabling it to tackle causal problems. The causal agent comprises tools, memory, and reasoning modules. In the tool module, the causal agent calls Python code and uses the encapsulated causal function module to align tabular data with natural language. In the reasoning module, the causal agent performs reasoning through multiple iterations with the tools. In the memory module, the causal agent maintains a dictionary instance where the keys are unique names and the values are causal graphs. To verify the causal ability of the causal agent, we established a Causal Tabular Question Answer (CausalTQA) benchmark consisting of four levels of causal problems: variable level, edge level, causal graph level, and causal effect level. CausalTQA consists of about 1.4K for these four levels questions. Causal agent demonstrates remarkable efficacy on the four-level causal problems, with accuracy rates all above 80\%. Through verification on the real-world dataset QRData, the causal agent is 6\% higher than the original SOTA. For further insights and implementation details, our code is accessible via the GitHub repository https://github.com/kairong-han/causal_agent.</p></details> |  |
| **[MapAgent: A Hierarchical Agent for Geospatial Reasoning with Dynamic Map Tool Integration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05933v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agentic AI has significantly extended the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by enabling complex reasoning and tool use. However, most existing frameworks are tailored to domains such as mathematics, coding, or web automation, and fall short on geospatial tasks that require spatial reasoning, multi-hop planning, and real-time map interaction. To address these challenges, we introduce MapAgent, a hierarchical multi-agent plug-and-play framework with customized toolsets and agentic scaffolds for map-integrated geospatial reasoning. Unlike existing flat agent-based approaches that treat tools uniformly-often overwhelming the LLM when handling similar but subtly different geospatial APIs-MapAgent decouples planning from execution. A high-level planner decomposes complex queries into subgoals, which are routed to specialized modules. For tool-heavy modules-such as map-based services-we then design a dedicated map-tool agent that efficiently orchestrates related APIs adaptively in parallel to effectively fetch geospatial data relevant for the query, while simpler modules (e.g., solution generation or answer extraction) operate without additional agent overhead. This hierarchical design reduces cognitive load, improves tool selection accuracy, and enables precise coordination across similar APIs. We evaluate MapAgent on four diverse geospatial benchmarks-MapEval-Textual, MapEval-API, MapEval-Visual, and MapQA-and demonstrate substantial gains over state-of-the-art tool-augmented and agentic baselines. We open-source our framwork at https://github.com/Hasebul/MapAgent.</p></details> | 27 Pages |
| **[Towards Engineering Multi-Agent LLMs: A Protocol-Driven Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12120v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing demand for software development has driven interest in automating software engineering (SE) tasks using Large Language Models (LLMs). Recent efforts extend LLMs into multi-agent systems (MAS) that emulate collaborative development workflows, but these systems often fail due to three core deficiencies: under-specification, coordination misalignment, and inappropriate verification, arising from the absence of foundational SE structuring principles. This paper introduces Software Engineering Multi-Agent Protocol (SEMAP), a protocol-layer methodology that instantiates three core SE design principles for multi-agent LLMs: (1) explicit behavioral contract modeling, (2) structured messaging, and (3) lifecycle-guided execution with verification, and is implemented atop Google's Agent-to-Agent (A2A) infrastructure. Empirical evaluation using the Multi-Agent System Failure Taxonomy (MAST) framework demonstrates that SEMAP effectively reduces failures across different SE tasks. In code development, it achieves up to a 69.6% reduction in total failures for function-level development and 56.7% for deployment-level development. For vulnerability detection, SEMAP reduces failure counts by up to 47.4% on Python tasks and 28.2% on C/C++ tasks.</p></details> |  |

Current approaches either rely on prompting to elicit the model's innate agent capabilities, or suffer from performance ceilings and collapse when applying RL to complex interactive tasks, leaving their true agentic potential untapped. To address this, we introduce \textbf{D}ynamic-filter \textbf{S}equence-level \textbf{P}olicy \textbf{O}ptimization (DSPO), an improved RL algorithm designed for robust agent training through sequence-level optimization and dynamic sample filtering. We train our model purely through RL to interleave multi-turn search and reasoning, obviating the need for supervised demonstration data. Across multiple QA benchmarks, our 7B model improves over a comparable previous work by \textbf{34.1\%}, and even outperforms the 14B model from previous work in complex multihop QA such as HotpotQA by nearly \textbf{9\% relative}, maintaining exceptional training stability.</p></details> |  |

In this framework, multiple agents involve inter-agent communication to perform environmental perception, sub-task decomposition and action generation, enabling efficient handling of complex manipulation scenarios. Evaluations show ManiAgent achieves an 86.8% success rate on the SimplerEnv benchmark and 95.8% on real-world pick-and-place tasks, enabling efficient data collection that yields VLA models with performance comparable to those trained on human-annotated datasets.

By integrating large language models (LLMs) with domain-specific computational tools, ToPolyAgent supports both interactive and autonomous simulation workflows across diverse polymer architectures, including linear, ring, brush, and star polymers, as well as dendrimers. The system consists of four LLM-powered agents: a Config Agent for generating initial polymer-solvent configurations, a Simulation Agent for executing LAMMPS-based MD simulations and conformational analyses, a Report Agent for compiling markdown reports, and a Workflow Agent for streamlined autonomous operations. Interactive mode incorporates user feedback loops for iterative refinements, while autonomous mode enables end-to-end task execution from detailed prompts. We demonstrate ToPolyAgent's versatility through case studies involving diverse polymer architectures under varying solvent condition, thermostats, and simulation lengths. Furthermore, we highlight its potential as a research assistant by directing it to investigate the effect of interaction parameters on the linear polymer conformation, and the influence of grafting density on the persistence length of the brush polymer. By coupling natural language interfaces with rigorous simulation tools, ToPolyAgent lowers barriers to complex computational workflows and advances AI-driven materials discovery in polymer science. It lays the foundation for autonomous and extensible multi-agent scientific research ecosystems.</p></details> | 10 pages, 8 figures |
| **[AI Agents as Universal Task Solvers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12066v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI reasoning agents are already able to solve a variety of tasks by deploying tools, simulating outcomes of multiple hypotheses and reflecting on them. In doing so, they perform computation, although not in the classical sense -- there is no program being executed. Still, if they perform computation, can AI agents be universal? Can chain-of-thought reasoning solve any computable task? How does an AI Agent learn to reason? Is it a matter of model size? Or training dataset size? In this work, we reinterpret the role of learning in the context of AI Agents, viewing them as compute-capable stochastic dynamical systems, and highlight the role of time in a foundational principle for learning to reason. In doing so, we propose a shift from classical inductive learning to transductive learning -- where the objective is not to approximate the distribution of past data, but to capture their algorithmic structure to reduce the time needed to find solutions to new tasks. Transductive learning suggests that, counter to Shannon's theory, a key role of information in learning is about reduction of time rather than reconstruction error. In particular, we show that the optimal speed-up that a universal solver can achieve using past data is tightly related to their algorithmic information. Using this, we show a theoretical derivation for the observed power-law scaling of inference time versus training time. We then show that scaling model size can lead to behaviors that, while improving accuracy on benchmarks, fail any reasonable test of intelligence, let alone super-intelligence: In the limit of infinite space and time, large models can behave as savants, able to brute-force through any task without any insight. Instead, we argue that the key quantity to optimize when scaling reasoning models is time, whose critical role in learning has so far only been indirectly considered.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph2Eval: Automatic Multimodal Task Generation for Agents via Knowledge Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00507v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As multimodal LLM-driven agents continue to advance in autonomy and generalization, evaluation based on static datasets can no longer adequately assess their true capabilities in dynamic environments and diverse tasks. Existing LLM-based synthetic data methods are largely designed for LLM training and evaluation, and thus cannot be directly applied to agent tasks that require tool use and interactive capabilities. While recent studies have explored automatic agent task generation with LLMs, most efforts remain limited to text or image analysis, without systematically modeling multi-step interactions in web environments. To address these challenges, we propose Graph2Eval, a knowledge graph-based framework that automatically generates both multimodal document comprehension tasks and web interaction tasks, enabling comprehensive evaluation of agents' reasoning, collaboration, and interactive capabilities. In our approach, knowledge graphs constructed from multi-source external data serve as the task space, where we translate semantic relations into structured multimodal tasks using subgraph sampling, task templates, and meta-paths. A multi-stage filtering pipeline based on node reachability, LLM scoring, and similarity analysis is applied to guarantee the quality and executability of the generated tasks. Furthermore, Graph2Eval supports end-to-end evaluation of multiple agent types (Single-Agent, Multi-Agent, Web Agent) and measures reasoning, collaboration, and interaction capabilities. We instantiate the framework with Graph2Eval-Bench, a curated dataset of 1,319 tasks spanning document comprehension and web interaction scenarios. Experiments show that Graph2Eval efficiently generates tasks that differentiate agent and model performance, revealing gaps in reasoning, collaboration, and web interaction across different settings and offering a new perspective for agent evaluation.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 10 figures.

Existing statistical approaches often lack semantic context, generalize poorly across events, and offer limited interpretability. While Large language models (LLMs) provide few-shot generalization, they remain text-bound and blind to geography. To bridge this gap, we introduce a Geospatial Awareness Layer (GAL) that grounds LLM agents in structured earth data. Starting from raw wildfire detections, GAL automatically retrieves and integrates infrastructure, demographic, terrain, and weather information from external geodatabases, assembling them into a concise, unit-annotated perception script. This enriched context enables agents to produce evidence-based resource-allocation recommendations (e.g., personnel assignments, budget allocations), further reinforced by historical analogs and daily change signals for incremental updates. We evaluate the framework in real wildfire scenarios across multiple LLM models, showing that geospatially grounded agents can outperform baselines. The proposed framework can generalize to other hazards such as floods and hurricanes.</p></details> |  |

Existing AI systems often function as isolated black boxes, lacking the seamless integration of prediction, explanation, and causal reasoning required for a unified decision-support solution. This fragmentation limits their trustworthiness and practical utility in high-stakes industrial environments. In this work, we present CausalTrace, a neurosymbolic causal analysis module integrated into the SmartPilot industrial CoPilot. CausalTrace performs data-driven causal analysis enriched by industrial ontologies and knowledge graphs, including advanced functions such as causal discovery, counterfactual reasoning, and root cause analysis (RCA). It supports real-time operator interaction and is designed to complement existing agents by offering transparent, explainable decision support. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation of CausalTrace using multiple causal assessment methods and the C3AN framework (i.e. Custom, Compact, Composite AI with Neurosymbolic Integration), which spans principles of robustness, intelligence, and trustworthiness. In an academic rocket assembly testbed, CausalTrace achieved substantial agreement with domain experts (ROUGE-1: 0.91 in ontology QA) and strong RCA performance (MAP@3: 94%, PR@2: 97%, MRR: 0.92, Jaccard: 0.92). It also attained 4.59/5 in the C3AN evaluation, demonstrating precision and reliability for live deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables, Accepted at AAAI 2026: IAAI - Innovative Applications of AI Conference</p></details> |
| **[Agent Learning via Early Experience](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08558v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A long-term goal of language agents is to learn and improve through their own experience, ultimately outperforming humans in complex, real-world tasks. However, training agents from experience data with reinforcement learning remains difficult in many environments, which either lack verifiable rewards (e.g., websites) or require inefficient long-horizon rollouts (e.g., multi-turn tool use). As a result, most current agents rely on supervised fine-tuning on expert data, which is challenging to scale and generalizes poorly. This limitation stems from the nature of expert demonstrations: they capture only a narrow range of scenarios and expose the agent to limited environment diversity. We address this limitation with a middle-ground paradigm we call early experience: interaction data generated by the agent's own actions, where the resulting future states serve as supervision without reward signals. Within this paradigm we study two strategies of using such data: (1) Implicit world modeling, which uses collected states to ground the policy in environment dynamics; and (2) Self-reflection, where the agent learns from its suboptimal actions to improve reasoning and decision-making. We evaluate across eight diverse environments and multiple model families. Our approaches consistently improve effectiveness and out-of-domain generalization, highlighting the value of early experience. Moreover, in environments with verifiable rewards, our results provide promising signals that early experience offers a strong foundation for subsequent reinforcement learning, positioning it as a practical bridge between imitation learning and fully experience-driven agents.</p></details> | Work in progress |

Evaluation with simulated users has been introduced as an alternative, however existing approaches typically model generic users and overlook the domain-specific principles required to capture realistic behavior. We propose SAGE, a novel user Simulation framework for multi-turn AGent Evaluation that integrates knowledge from business contexts. SAGE incorporates top-down knowledge rooted in business logic, such as ideal customer profiles, grounding user behavior in realistic customer personas. We further integrate bottom-up knowledge taken from business agent infrastructure (e.g., product catalogs, FAQs, and knowledge bases), allowing the simulator to generate interactions that reflect users' information needs and expectations in a company's target market. Through empirical evaluation, we find that this approach produces interactions that are more realistic and diverse, while also identifying up to 33% more agent errors, highlighting its effectiveness as an evaluation tool to support bug-finding and iterative agent improvement.</p></details> |  |
| **[Holistic Agent Leaderboard: The Missing Infrastructure for AI Agent Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11977v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI agents have been developed for complex real-world tasks from coding to customer service. But AI agent evaluations suffer from many challenges that undermine our understanding of how well agents really work. We introduce the Holistic Agent Leaderboard (HAL) to address these challenges. We make three main contributions. First, we provide a standardized evaluation harness that orchestrates parallel evaluations across hundreds of VMs, reducing evaluation time from weeks to hours while eliminating common implementation bugs. Second, we conduct three-dimensional analysis spanning models, scaffolds, and benchmarks. We validate the harness by conducting 21,730 agent rollouts across 9 models and 9 benchmarks in coding, web navigation, science, and customer service with a total cost of about $40,000. Our analysis reveals surprising insights, such as higher reasoning effort reducing accuracy in the majority of runs. Third, we use LLM-aided log inspection to uncover previously unreported behaviors, such as searching for the benchmark on HuggingFace instead of solving a task, or misusing credit cards in flight booking tasks. We share all agent logs, comprising 2.5B tokens of language model calls, to incentivize further research into agent behavior. By standardizing how the field evaluates agents and addressing common pitfalls in agent evaluation, we hope to shift the focus from agents that ace benchmarks to agents that work reliably in the real world.</p></details> |  |
| **[Strategic Tradeoffs Between Humans and AI in Multi-Agent Bargaining](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09071v3)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly embedded in collaborative human activities such as business negotiations and group coordination, it becomes critical to evaluate both the performance gains they can achieve and how they interact in dynamic, multi-agent environments. Unlike traditional statistical agents such as Bayesian models, which may excel under well-specified conditions, large language models (LLMs) can generalize across diverse, real-world scenarios, raising new questions about how their strategies and behaviors compare to those of humans and other agent types. In this work, we compare outcomes and behavioral dynamics across humans (N = 216), LLMs (GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro), and Bayesian agents in a dynamic negotiation setting under identical conditions. Bayesian agents extract the highest surplus through aggressive optimization, at the cost of frequent trade rejections. Humans and LLMs achieve similar overall surplus, but through distinct behaviors: LLMs favor conservative, concessionary trades with few rejections, while humans employ more strategic, risk-taking, and fairness-oriented behaviors. Thus, we find that performance parity -- a common benchmark in agent evaluation -- can conceal fundamental differences in process and alignment, which are critical for practical deployment in real-world coordination tasks. By establishing foundational behavioral baselines under matched conditions, this work provides a baseline for future studies in more applied, variable-rich environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scaling Long-Horizon LLM Agent via Context-Folding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11967v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM) agents are fundamentally constrained by context length on long-horizon tasks. We introduce Context-Folding, a framework that empowers agents to actively manage their working context. An agent can procedurally branch into a sub-trajectory to handle a subtask and then fold it upon completion, collapsing the intermediate steps while retaining a concise summary of the outcome. To make this behavior learnable, we develop an end-to-end reinforcement learning framework FoldGRPO with specific process rewards to encourage effective task decomposition and context management. On complex long-horizon tasks (Deep Research and SWE), our folding agent matches or outperforms the ReAct baselines while using an active context 10$\times$ smaller and significantly outperforms models that rely on summarization-based context management.</p></details> |  |
| **[VIDEE: Visual and Interactive Decomposition, Execution, and Evaluation of Text Analytics with Intelligent Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21582v4)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text analytics has traditionally required specialized knowledge in Natural Language Processing (NLP) or text analysis, which presents a barrier for entry-level analysts. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have changed the landscape of NLP by enabling more accessible and automated text analysis (e.g., topic detection, summarization, information extraction, etc.). We introduce VIDEE, a system that supports entry-level data analysts to conduct advanced text analytics with intelligent agents. VIDEE instantiates a human-agent collaroration workflow consisting of three stages: (1) Decomposition, which incorporates a human-in-the-loop Monte-Carlo Tree Search algorithm to support generative reasoning with human feedback, (2) Execution, which generates an executable text analytics pipeline, and (3) Evaluation, which integrates LLM-based evaluation and visualizations to support user validation of execution results. We conduct two quantitative experiments to evaluate VIDEE's effectiveness and analyze common agent errors. A user study involving participants with varying levels of NLP and text analytics experience -- from none to expert -- demonstrates the system's usability and reveals distinct user behavior patterns. The findings identify design implications for human-agent collaboration, validate the practical utility of VIDEE for non-expert users, and inform future improvements to intelligent text analytics systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[R-WoM: Retrieval-augmented World Model For Computer-use Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11892v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) can serve as world models to enhance agent decision-making in digital environments by simulating future states and predicting action outcomes, potentially eliminating costly trial-and-error exploration. However, this capability is fundamentally limited by LLMs' tendency toward hallucination and their reliance on static training knowledge, which can lead to compounding errors that inhibit long-horizon simulations. To systematically investigate whether LLMs are appropriate for world modeling, we probe two core capabilities of world models--future state prediction and reward estimation--through three tasks: next-state identification, full-procedure planning alignment, and milestone transition recognition. Our analysis shows that while LLMs effectively capture immediate next states and identify meaningful state transitions, their performance rapidly degrades in full-procedure planning. This highlights LLMs' limitations in reliably modeling environment dynamics over long horizons. To address these limitations, we propose the Retrieval-augmented World Model (R-WoM), which grounds LLM simulations by incorporating factual, up-to-date knowledge retrieved from external tutorials. Experiments show that R-WoM achieves substantial improvements of up to 25.3% (OSWorld) and 18.1% (WebArena) compared to baselines, with particular advantages in longer-horizon simulations.</p></details> |  |
| **[EmoDebt: Bayesian-Optimized Emotional Intelligence for Strategic Agent-to-Agent Debt Recovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21080v5)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of autonomous Large Language Model (LLM) agents has created a new ecosystem of strategic, agent-to-agent interactions. However, a critical challenge remains unaddressed: in high-stakes, emotion-sensitive domains like debt collection, LLM agents pre-trained on human dialogue are vulnerable to exploitation by adversarial counterparts who simulate negative emotions to derail negotiations. To fill this gap, we first contribute a novel dataset of simulated debt recovery scenarios and a multi-agent simulation framework. Within this framework, we introduce EmoDebt, an LLM agent architected for robust performance. Its core innovation is a Bayesian-optimized emotional intelligence engine that reframes a model's ability to express emotion in negotiation as a sequential decision-making problem. Through online learning, this engine continuously tunes EmoDebt's emotional transition policies, discovering optimal counter-strategies against specific debtor tactics. Extensive experiments on our proposed benchmark demonstrate that EmoDebt achieves significant strategic robustness, substantially outperforming non-adaptive and emotion-agnostic baselines across key performance metrics, including success rate and operational efficiency. By introducing both a critical benchmark and a robustly adaptive agent, this work establishes a new foundation for deploying strategically robust LLM agents in adversarial, emotion-sensitive debt interactions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pathology-CoT: Learning Visual Chain-of-Thought Agent from Expert Whole Slide Image Diagnosis Behavior](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04587v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diagnosing a whole-slide image is an interactive, multi-stage process of changing magnification and moving between fields. Although recent pathology foundation models demonstrated superior performances, practical agentic systems that decide what field to examine next, adjust magnification, and deliver explainable diagnoses are still lacking. Such limitation is largely bottlenecked by data: scalable, clinically aligned supervision of expert viewing behavior that is tacit and experience-based, not documented in textbooks or internet, and therefore absent from LLM training. Here we introduce a framework designed to address this challenge through three key breakthroughs. First, the AI Session Recorder seamlessly integrates with standard whole-slide image viewers to unobtrusively record routine navigation and convert the viewer logs into standardized behavioral commands and bounding boxes. Second, a lightweight human-in-the-loop review turns AI-drafted rationales for behavioral commands into the Pathology-CoT dataset, a form of paired "where to look" and "why it matters", enabling six-fold faster labeling compared to manual constructing such Chain-of-Thought dataset. Using this behavioral data, we build Pathology-o3, a two-stage agent that first proposes important ROIs and then performs behavior-guided reasoning. On the gastrointestinal lymph-node metastasis detection task, our method achieved 100 recall on the internal validation from Stanford Medicine and 97.6 recall on an independent external validation from Sweden, exceeding the state-of-the-art OpenAI o3 model and generalizing across backbones. To our knowledge, Pathology-CoT constitutes one of the first behavior-grounded agentic systems in pathology. Turning everyday viewer logs into scalable, expert-validated supervision, our framework makes agentic pathology practical and establishes a path to human-aligned, upgradeable clinical AI.</p></details> |  |
| **[Empirical Study on Robustness and Resilience in Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11824v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), it is a common practice to tune hyperparameters in ideal simulated environments to maximize cooperative performance. However, policies tuned for cooperation often fail to maintain robustness and resilience under real-world uncertainties. Building trustworthy MARL systems requires a deep understanding of robustness, which ensures stability under uncertainties, and resilience, the ability to recover from disruptions--a concept extensively studied in control systems but largely overlooked in MARL. In this paper, we present a large-scale empirical study comprising over 82,620 experiments to evaluate cooperation, robustness, and resilience in MARL across 4 real-world environments, 13 uncertainty types, and 15 hyperparameters. Our key findings are: (1) Under mild uncertainty, optimizing cooperation improves robustness and resilience, but this link weakens as perturbations intensify. Robustness and resilience also varies by algorithm and uncertainty type. (2) Robustness and resilience do not generalize across uncertainty modalities or agent scopes: policies robust to action noise for all agents may fail under observation noise on a single agent. (3) Hyperparameter tuning is critical for trustworthy MARL: surprisingly, standard practices like parameter sharing, GAE, and PopArt can hurt robustness, while early stopping, high critic learning rates, and Leaky ReLU consistently help. By optimizing hyperparameters only, we observe substantial improvement in cooperation, robustness and resilience across all MARL backbones, with the phenomenon also generalizing to robust MARL methods across these backbones.

| **[Demystifying Reinforcement Learning in Agentic Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11701v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, the emergence of agentic RL has showcased that RL could also effectively improve the agentic reasoning ability of LLMs, yet the key design principles and optimal practices remain unclear. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive and systematic investigation to demystify reinforcement learning in agentic reasoning from three key perspectives: data, algorithm, and reasoning mode. We highlight our key insights: (i) Replacing stitched synthetic trajectories with real end-to-end tool-use trajectories yields a far stronger SFT initialization; high-diversity, model-aware datasets sustain exploration and markedly improve RL performance. (ii) Exploration-friendly techniques are crucial for agentic RL, such as clip higher, overlong reward shaping, and maintaining adequate policy entropy could improve the training efficiency. (iii) A deliberative strategy with fewer tool calls outperforms frequent tool calls or verbose self-reasoning, improving tool efficiency and final accuracy. Together, these simple practices consistently enhance agentic reasoning and training efficiency, achieving strong results on challenging benchmarks with smaller models, and establishing a practical baseline for future agentic RL research. Beyond these empirical insights, we further contribute a high-quality, real end-to-end agentic SFT dataset along with a high-quality RL dataset, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our insights in boosting the agentic reasoning ability of LLMs across four challenging benchmarks, including AIME2024/AIME2025, GPQA-Diamond, and LiveCodeBench-v6. With our recipes, 4B-sized models could also achieve superior agentic reasoning performance compared to 32B-sized models.

To address these gaps, we introduce Agent Market Arena (AMA), the first lifelong, real-time benchmark for evaluating LLM-based trading agents across multiple markets. AMA integrates verified trading data, expert-checked news, and diverse agent architectures within a unified trading framework, enabling fair and continuous comparison under real conditions. It implements four agents, including InvestorAgent as a single-agent baseline, TradeAgent and HedgeFundAgent with different risk styles, and DeepFundAgent with memory-based reasoning, and evaluates them across GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, Claude-3.5-haiku, Claude-sonnet-4, and Gemini-2.0-flash. Live experiments on both cryptocurrency and stock markets demonstrate that agent frameworks display markedly distinct behavioral patterns, spanning from aggressive risk-taking to conservative decision-making, whereas model backbones contribute less to outcome variation. AMA thus establishes a foundation for rigorous, reproducible, and continuously evolving evaluation of financial reasoning and trading intelligence in LLM-based agents.</p></details> |  |

However, current methods typically confine LLMs to the role of an equation proposer within search algorithms like genetic programming. In this paper, we present SR-Scientist, a framework that elevates the LLM from a simple equation proposer to an autonomous AI scientist that writes code to analyze data, implements the equation as code, submits it for evaluation, and optimizes the equation based on experimental feedback. Specifically, we wrap the code interpreter into a set of tools for data analysis and equation evaluation. The agent is instructed to optimize the equation by utilizing these tools over a long horizon with minimal human-defined pipelines. Empirical results show that SR-Scientist outperforms baseline methods by an absolute margin of 6% to 35% on datasets covering four science disciplines. Additionally, we demonstrate our method's robustness to noise, the generalization of the discovered equations to out-of-domain data, and their symbolic accuracy. Furthermore, we develop an end-to-end reinforcement learning framework to enhance the agent's capabilities.</p></details> |  |

Most existing approaches lack transparency in their decision-making and provide limited attribution to credible sources. We introduce FinVet, a novel multi-agent framework that integrates two Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines with external fact-checking through a confidence-weighted voting mechanism. FinVet employs adaptive three-tier processing that dynamically adjusts verification strategies based on retrieval confidence, from direct metadata extraction to hybrid reasoning to full model-based analysis. Unlike existing methods, FinVet provides evidence-backed verdicts, source attribution, confidence scores, and explicit uncertainty flags when evidence is insufficient. Experimental evaluation on the FinFact dataset shows that FinVet achieves an F1 score of 0.85, which is a 10.4% improvement over the best individual pipeline (fact-check pipeline) and 37% improvement over standalone RAG approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[StreamAgent: Towards Anticipatory Agents for Streaming Video Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01875v3)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-time streaming video understanding in domains such as autonomous driving and intelligent surveillance poses challenges beyond conventional offline video processing, requiring continuous perception, proactive decision making, and responsive interaction based on dynamically evolving visual content. However, existing methods rely on alternating perception-reaction or asynchronous triggers, lacking task-driven planning and future anticipation, which limits their real-time responsiveness and proactive decision making in evolving video streams. To this end, we propose a StreamAgent that anticipates the temporal intervals and spatial regions expected to contain future task-relevant information to enable proactive and goal-driven responses. Specifically, we integrate question semantics and historical observations through prompting the anticipatory agent to anticipate the temporal progression of key events, align current observations with the expected future evidence, and subsequently adjust the perception action (e.g., attending to task-relevant regions or continuously tracking in subsequent frames). To enable efficient inference, we design a streaming KV-cache memory mechanism that constructs a hierarchical memory structure for selective recall of relevant tokens, enabling efficient semantic retrieval while reducing the overhead of storing all tokens in the traditional KV-cache. Extensive experiments on streaming and long video understanding tasks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods in response accuracy and real-time efficiency, highlighting its practical value for real-world streaming scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Inspired by this creative process, we propose a novel approach to long-form story generation, termed hybrid bottom-up long-form story generation, using multi-agent simulations. In our method, agents interact within a dynamic sandbox environment, where their behaviors and interactions with one another and the environment generate emergent events. These events form the foundation for the story, enabling organic character development and plot progression. Unlike traditional top-down approaches that impose rigid structures, our hybrid bottom-up approach allows for the natural unfolding of events, fostering more spontaneous and engaging storytelling. The system is capable of generating stories exceeding 10,000 words while maintaining coherence and consistency, addressing some of the key challenges faced by current story generation models. We achieve state-of-the-art performance across several metrics. This approach offers a scalable and innovative solution for creating dynamic, immersive long-form stories that evolve organically from agent-driven interactions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project: https://storyboxproject.github.io</p></details> |

To address this, we present ParaCook, a benchmark for time-efficient collaborative planning. Inspired by the Overcooked game, ParaCook provides an environment for various challenging interaction planning of multi-agent systems that are instantiated as cooking tasks, with a simplified action space to isolate the core challenge of strategic parallel planning. Through a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs, we find that current approaches achieve suboptimal plans, which struggle with parallel actions or coordination. Our analysis also reveals LLMs' potential on abstract tasks where they can focus on high-level parallel optimization. ParaCook provides a scalable evaluation framework with adjustable complexity, establishing a foundation for developing and assessing time efficiency-aware multi-agent planning.

Prior work has primarily focused on debates within homogeneous groups of agents, whereas we explore how diversity in model capabilities influences the dynamics and outcomes of multi-agent interactions. Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate that debate can lead to a decrease in accuracy over time - even in settings where stronger (i.e., more capable) models outnumber their weaker counterparts. Our analysis reveals that models frequently shift from correct to incorrect answers in response to peer reasoning, favoring agreement over challenging flawed reasoning. We perform additional experiments investigating various potential contributing factors to these harmful shifts - including sycophancy, social conformity, and model and task type. These results highlight important failure modes in the exchange of reasons during multi-agent debate, suggesting that naive applications of debate may cause performance degradation when agents are neither incentivised nor adequately equipped to resist persuasive but incorrect reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML MAS Workshop 2025</p></details> |

We measure our main outcome using established psychological questionnaires based on the Theory of Planned Behavior and additionally investigate Social Costs. We find evidence that our preliminary simulations produce outcomes that are (i) consistent with theoretical expectations; and (ii) valid when compared to data from previous studies with human participants. Generative agent-based models are a promising tool for identifying novel communication strategies on meat reduction -- tailored to highly specific participant groups -- to then be tested in subsequent studies with human participants.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available at https://github.com/dess-mannheim/MeatlessAgents</p></details> |

As requirements grow, these documents expand rapidly, causing high computational overhead. This motivates developing internalization methods that embed policy documents into model priors while preserving performance. Prior prompt compression work targets generic prompts, but agentic policy documents span multiple complexity levels and require deeper reasoning, making internalization harder. We introduce CC-Gen, an agentic benchmark generator with Controllable Complexity across four levels, enabling systematic evaluation of agents' ability to handle complexity and offering a unified framework for assessing policy internalization. Our analysis shows that complex policy specifications governing workflows pose major reasoning challenges. Supporting internalization with gold user agent interaction trajectories containing chain-of-thought (CoT) annotations via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is data-intensive and degrades sharply as policy complexity increases. To mitigate data and reasoning burdens, we propose Category-Aware Policy Continued Pretraining (CAP-CPT). Our automated pipeline parses policy documents to extract key specifications, grouping them into factual, behavioral, and conditional categories, and isolating complex conditions that drive workflow complexity. This guides targeted data synthesis and enables agents to internalize policy information through an autoregressive pretraining loss. Experiments show CAP-CPT improves SFT baselines in all settings, with up to 41% and 22% gains on Qwen-3-32B, achieving 97.3% prompt length reduction on CC-Gen and further enhancing tau-Bench with minimal SFT data.</p></details> | 42 pages |

Existing performant VQA models trained with direct score supervision suffer from (1) poor generalization across diverse content and tasks, ranging from user-generated content (UGC), short-form videos, to AI-generated content (AIGC), (2) limited interpretability, and (3) lack of extensibility to novel use cases or content types. We propose Q-Router, an agentic framework for universal VQA with a multi-tier model routing system. Q-Router integrates a diverse set of expert models and employs vision--language models (VLMs) as real-time routers that dynamically reason and then ensemble the most appropriate experts conditioned on the input video semantics. We build a multi-tiered routing system based on the computing budget, with the heaviest tier involving a specific spatiotemporal artifacts localization for interpretability. This agentic design enables Q-Router to combine the complementary strengths of specialized experts, achieving both flexibility and robustness in delivering consistent performance across heterogeneous video sources and tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Q-Router matches or surpasses state-of-the-art VQA models on a variety of benchmarks, while substantially improving generalization and interpretability. Moreover, Q-Router excels on the quality-based question answering benchmark, Q-Bench-Video, highlighting its promise as a foundation for next-generation VQA systems. Finally, we show that Q-Router capably localizes spatiotemporal artifacts, showing potential as a reward function for post-training video generation models.</p></details> |  |

However, existing LLM agents largely overlook the functional role of emotions in such negotiations, instead generating passive, preference-driven emotional responses that make them vulnerable to manipulation and strategic exploitation by adversarial counterparts. To address this gap, we present EvoEmo, an evolutionary reinforcement learning framework that optimizes dynamic emotional expression in negotiations. EvoEmo models emotional state transitions as a Markov Decision Process and employs population-based genetic optimization to evolve high-reward emotion policies across diverse negotiation scenarios. We further propose an evaluation framework with two baselines -- vanilla strategies and fixed-emotion strategies -- for benchmarking emotion-aware negotiation. Extensive experiments and ablation studies show that EvoEmo consistently outperforms both baselines, achieving higher success rates, higher efficiency, and increased buyer savings. This findings highlight the importance of adaptive emotional expression in enabling more effective LLM agents for multi-turn negotiation.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Flexible Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning Framework for Dynamic Routing and Scheduling of Latency-Critical Services](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11535v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Timely delivery of delay-sensitive information over dynamic, heterogeneous networks is increasingly essential for a range of interactive applications, such as industrial automation, self-driving vehicles, and augmented reality. However, most existing network control solutions target only average delay performance, falling short of providing strict End-to-End (E2E) peak latency guarantees. This paper addresses the challenge of reliably delivering packets within application-imposed deadlines by leveraging recent advancements in Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MA-DRL). After introducing the Delay-Constrained Maximum-Throughput (DCMT) dynamic network control problem, and highlighting the limitations of current solutions, we present a novel MA-DRL network control framework that leverages a centralized routing and distributed scheduling architecture. The proposed framework leverages critical networking domain knowledge for the design of effective MA-DRL strategies based on the Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG) technique, where centralized routing and distributed scheduling agents dynamically assign paths and schedule packet transmissions according to packet lifetimes, thereby maximizing on-time packet delivery. The generality of the proposed framework allows integrating both data-driven \blue{Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)} agents and traditional rule-based policies in order to strike the right balance between performance and learning complexity. Our results confirm the superiority of the proposed framework with respect to traditional stochastic optimization-based approaches and provide key insights into the role and interplay between data-driven DRL agents and new rule-based policies for both efficient and high-performance control of latency-critical services.</p></details> |  |

We present ReLook, an agentic, vision-grounded reinforcement learning framework that empowers an agent to close a robust generate--diagnose--refine loop by invoking a multimodal LLM (MLLM) as a tool. During training, the agent uses the MLLM-in-the-loop both as a visual critic--scoring code with screenshots--and as a source of actionable, vision-grounded feedback; a strict zero-reward rule for invalid renders anchors renderability and prevents reward hacking. To prevent behavioral collapse, we introduce Forced Optimization, a strict acceptance rule that admits only improving revisions, yielding monotonically better trajectories. At inference, we decouple the critic and run a lightweight, critic-free self-edit cycle, keeping latency comparable to base decoding while retaining most of the gains. Across three widely used benchmarks, ReLook consistently outperforms strong baselines in vision-grounded front-end code generation, highlighting the benefits of agentic perception, visual rewards, and training-inference decoupling.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce a novel 3D multi-agent air combat environment and a Hierarchical Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning framework to tackle these challenges. Our approach combines heterogeneous agent dynamics, curriculum learning, league-play, and a newly adapted training algorithm. To this end, the decision-making process is organized into two abstraction levels: low-level policies learn precise control maneuvers, while high-level policies issue tactical commands based on mission objectives. Empirical results show that our hierarchical approach improves both learning efficiency and combat performance in complex dogfight scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>2025 ...</summary><p>2025 IEEE International Conference on Agentic AI (ICA)</p></details> |
| **[Uncertainty-Aware, Risk-Adaptive Access Control for Agentic Systems using an LLM-Judged TBAC Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11414v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The proliferation of autonomous AI agents within enterprise environments introduces a critical security challenge: managing access control for emergent, novel tasks for which no predefined policies exist. This paper introduces an advanced security framework that extends the Task-Based Access Control (TBAC) model by using a Large Language Model (LLM) as an autonomous, risk-aware judge. This model makes access control decisions not only based on an agent's intent but also by explicitly considering the inherent \textbf{risk associated with target resources} and the LLM's own \textbf{model uncertainty} in its decision-making process. When an agent proposes a novel task, the LLM judge synthesizes a just-in-time policy while also computing a composite risk score for the task and an uncertainty estimate for its own reasoning. High-risk or high-uncertainty requests trigger more stringent controls, such as requiring human approval. This dual consideration of external risk and internal confidence allows the model to enforce a more robust and adaptive version of the principle of least privilege, paving the way for safer and more trustworthy autonomous systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Part II: ROLL Flash -- Accelerating RLVR and Agentic Training with Asynchrony](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11345v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Synchronous Reinforcement Learning (RL) post-training has emerged as a crucial step for enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) with diverse capabilities. However, many systems designed to accelerate RL post-training still suffer from low resource utilization and limited scalability. We present ROLL Flash, a system that extends ROLL with native support for asynchronous RL post-training. ROLL Flash is built upon two core design principles: fine-grained parallelism and rollout-train decoupling. Guided by these principles, ROLL Flash provides flexible programming interfaces that enable a fully asynchronous training architecture and support efficient rollout mechanisms, including queue scheduling and environment-level asynchronous execution. Through comprehensive theoretical analysis and extensive experiments, we demonstrate that ROLL Flash significantly improves resource utilization and scalability over synchronous RL post-training. ROLL Flash achieves up to 2.24x speedup on RLVR tasks and 2.72x on agentic tasks, using the same GPU budget as synchronous baselines. Furthermore, we implement several popular off-policy algorithms and verify that asynchronous training can achieve performance on par with synchronous training.</p></details> |  |

We propose the AI-Agent School (AAS) system, built around a self-evolving mechanism that leverages agents for simulating complex educational dynamics. Addressing the fragmented issues in teaching process modeling and the limitations of agents performance in simulating diverse educational participants, AAS constructs the Zero-Exp strategy, employs a continuous "experience-reflection-optimization" cycle, grounded in a dual memory base comprising experience and knowledge bases and incorporating short-term and long-term memory components. Through this mechanism, agents autonomously evolve via situated interactions within diverse simulated school scenarios. This evolution enables agents to more accurately model the nuanced, multi-faceted teacher-student engagements and underlying learning processes found in physical schools. Experiment confirms that AAS can effectively simulate intricate educational dynamics and is effective in fostering advanced agent cognitive abilities, providing a foundational stepping stone from the "Era of Experience" to the "Era of Simulation" by generating high-fidelity behavioral and interaction data.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 7 figures, EMNLP conference</p></details> |

Recent advances in artificial intelligence for chemistry have sought to expedite individual drug discovery tasks; however, there remains a critical need for an intelligent agent that can navigate the drug discovery process. Towards this end, we introduce LIDDIA, an autonomous agent capable of intelligently navigating the drug discovery process in silico. By leveraging the reasoning capabilities of large language models, LIDDIA serves as a low-cost and highly-adaptable tool for autonomous drug discovery. We comprehensively examine LIDDIA , demonstrating that (1) it can generate molecules meeting key pharmaceutical criteria on over 70% of 30 clinically relevant targets, (2) it intelligently balances exploration and exploitation in the chemical space, and (3) it identifies one promising novel candidate on AR/NR3C4, a critical target for both prostate and breast cancers.

However, existing research has focused exclusively on single-agent backdoor attacks, overlooking the novel attack surfaces introduced by agent collaboration in MAS. To bridge this gap, we present the first Distributed Backdoor Attack tailored to MAS. We decompose the backdoor into multiple distributed attack primitives that are embedded within MAS tools. These primitives remain dormant individually but collectively activate only when agents collaborate in a specific sequence, thereby assembling the full backdoor to execute targeted attacks such as data exfiltration. To fully assess this threat, we introduce a benchmark for multi-role collaborative tasks and a sandboxed framework to evaluate. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our attack achieves an attack success rate exceeding 95% without degrading performance on benign tasks. This work exposes novel backdoor attack surfaces that exploit agent collaboration, underscoring the need to move beyond single-agent protection. Code and benchmark are available at https://github.com/whfeLingYu/Distributed-Backdoor-Attacks-in-MAS.</p></details> |  |

The challenge is amplified by web agents' inherently complex prompts that include goals, action histories, and environmental states, leading to degraded LLM ensemble performance. To address this, we introduce WebRouter, a novel query-specific router trained from an information-theoretic perspective. Our core contribution is a cost-aware Variational Information Bottleneck (ca-VIB) objective, which learns a compressed representation of the input prompt while explicitly penalizing the expected operational cost. Experiments on five real-world websites from the WebVoyager benchmark show that WebRouter reduces operational costs by a striking 87.8\% compared to a GPT-4o baseline, while incurring only a 3.8\% accuracy drop.</p></details> |  |
| **[TraceAegis: Securing LLM-Based Agents via Hierarchical and Behavioral Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11203v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM-based agents have demonstrated promising adaptability in real-world applications. However, these agents remain vulnerable to a wide range of attacks, such as tool poisoning and malicious instructions, that compromise their execution flow and can lead to serious consequences like data breaches and financial loss. Existing studies typically attempt to mitigate such anomalies by predefining specific rules and enforcing them at runtime to enhance safety. Yet, designing comprehensive rules is difficult, requiring extensive manual effort and still leaving gaps that result in false negatives. As agent systems evolve into complex software systems, we take inspiration from software system security and propose TraceAegis, a provenance-based analysis framework that leverages agent execution traces to detect potential anomalies. In particular, TraceAegis constructs a hierarchical structure to abstract stable execution units that characterize normal agent behaviors. These units are then summarized into constrained behavioral rules that specify the conditions necessary to complete a task. By validating execution traces against both hierarchical and behavioral constraints, TraceAegis is able to effectively detect abnormal behaviors. To evaluate the effectiveness of TraceAegis, we introduce TraceAegis-Bench, a dataset covering two representative scenarios: healthcare and corporate procurement. Each scenario includes 1,300 benign behaviors and 300 abnormal behaviors, where the anomalies either violate the agent's execution order or break the semantic consistency of its execution sequence. Experimental results demonstrate that TraceAegis achieves strong performance on TraceAegis-Bench, successfully identifying the majority of abnormal behaviors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Agent-Based Modelling for Real-World Stock Markets under Behavioral Economic Principles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12987v3)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The reproduction of realistic dynamics in financial markets is of great significance, as it enhances our understanding of market evolution beyond other physical processes, and facilitates the development and backtesting of investment strategies. Most existing literature approaches this issue as a time series forecasting problem, which often faces challenges such as 1) overfitting historical data, 2) failing to reconstruct stylized facts, and 3) limiting users' ability to conduct counterfactual analyses. To address these limitations, we employ agent-based modeling (ABM) for market simulation, where each trader acts as an autonomous agent guided by established behavioral-economic principles. The parameters of the agent model are subsequently calibrated using deep learning techniques. Additionally, we align our agent model with publicly available economic indices, such as the Consumer Price Index (CPI), to enhance the explainability of our system's outcomes. Our experiments demonstrate that the ABM method effectively reproduces market dynamics with a confidence level of 90%, accurately reflecting well-known stylized facts. Furthermore, the calibration process proves to be more computationally efficient compared to other existing methods that perform simulation-based inference. We also present case studies illustrating the correlation between agent parameters and economic indices.</p></details> |  |
| **[Agents of Change: Self-Evolving LLM Agents for Strategic Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04651v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We address the long-horizon gap in large language model (LLM) agents by enabling them to sustain coherent strategies in adversarial, stochastic environments. Settlers of Catan provides a challenging benchmark: success depends on balancing short- and long-term goals amid randomness, trading, expansion, and blocking. Prompt-centric LLM agents (e.g., ReAct, Reflexion) must re-interpret large, evolving game states each turn, quickly saturating context windows and losing strategic consistency. We propose HexMachina, a continual learning multi-agent system that separates environment discovery (inducing an adapter layer without documentation) from strategy improvement (evolving a compiled player through code refinement and simulation). This design preserves executable artifacts, allowing the LLM to focus on high-level strategy rather than per-turn reasoning. In controlled Catanatron experiments, HexMachina learns from scratch and evolves players that outperform the strongest human-crafted baseline (AlphaBeta), achieving a 54% win rate and surpassing prompt-driven and no-discovery baselines. Ablations confirm that isolating pure strategy learning improves performance. Overall, artifact-centric continual learning transforms LLMs from brittle stepwise deciders into stable strategy designers, advancing long-horizon autonomy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking Reward Miscalibration of GRPO in Agentic RL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23870v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Building autonomous agents capable of solving long-horizon, real-world tasks has garnered significant research interest. But outcome based rewards may cause reward miscalibration which means it might mistakenly allocate positive reward to flawed middle steps which is regarded as the key reason making the bad actions being reinforced during training. However we reveal that outcome based reward ensures expected negative advantage for those flawed middle steps, which means the flawed actions should be punished during training. Even accounting for the ``squeezing effect", the probability mass of good actions should increase and the actor should gradually get rid of harmful actions. This shows that flawed actions should be punished during training. We further identify gradient coupling between similar samples as a key issue in agentic RL, the input prompt is extremely similar and the output action space is limited, therefore during training, gradients from well-performing samples can inadvertently strengthen suboptimal or incorrect actions due to similar input observation and output actions. We show that with gradient coupling, some flawed actions might be enhanced. To address this, we propose training the actor to classify good or bad actions to separate the embedding of good/bad actions and alleviate the gradient interference, extensive experiments shows its effectiveness.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Vision for Access Control in LLM-based Agent Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11108v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The autonomy and contextual complexity of LLM-based agents render traditional access control (AC) mechanisms insufficient. Static, rule-based systems designed for predictable environments are fundamentally ill-equipped to manage the dynamic information flows inherent in agentic interactions. This position paper argues for a paradigm shift from binary access control to a more sophisticated model of information governance, positing that the core challenge is not merely about permission, but about governing the flow of information. We introduce Agent Access Control (AAC), a novel framework that reframes AC as a dynamic, context-aware process of information flow governance. AAC operates on two core modules: (1) multi-dimensional contextual evaluation, which assesses not just identity but also relationships, scenarios, and norms; and (2) adaptive response formulation, which moves beyond simple allow/deny decisions to shape information through redaction, summarization, and paraphrasing. This vision, powered by a dedicated AC reasoning engine, aims to bridge the gap between human-like nuanced judgment and scalable Al safety, proposing a new conceptual lens for future research in trustworthy agent design.</p></details> | 10 pages, 1 figure |

Building upon a previously established multi-level intelligent agent economic model, this paper conducts simulation-based comparisons of macroeconomic output evolution in China and the United States under different mechanisms-AI collaboration, network effects, and AI autonomous production. The results show that: (1) when AI functions as an independent productive entity, the overall growth rate of social output far exceeds that of traditional human-labor-based models; (2) China demonstrates clear potential for acceleration in both the expansion of intelligent agent populations and the pace of technological catch-up, offering the possibility of achieving technological convergence or even partial surpassing. This study provides a systematic, model-based analytical framework for understanding AI-driven production system transformation and shifts in international competitiveness, as well as quantitative insights for relevant policy formulation.</p></details> |  |
| **[DebugTA: An LLM-Based Agent for Simplifying Debugging and Teaching in Programming Education](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11076v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In programming education, Debugging and Teaching (DT) task is a common scenario where students receive assistance in correcting their erroneous code. The task involves multiple inputs, including erroneous code, error messages, reference solutions, and the question description, with the goal of generating modification suggestions to the erroneous code. However, two key challenges hinder the effectiveness of existing approaches. Firstly, the complexity and heterogeneity of inputs inherent in DT tasks significantly elevate the reasoning challenges faced by LLMs. Second, existing approaches often fail to fully leverage the availability of standard code in DT tasks, forcing models to rely solely on complex multi-step reasoning, which limits the potential of LLMs in addressing DT tasks effectively. To address these challenges, we propose DebugTA, a novel LLM-based debugging and teaching agent with specialized tools for standard code retrieval, variable substitution to align reference code, and an external compiler for real-time code analysis. Guided by explicit pedagogical and debugging principles, DebugTA acts as an agent that decomposes a complex task into sequential LLM interactions, each utilizing distinct tools for specific subtasks, thereby simplifying the logical reasoning at each step and reducing overall reasoning complexity. Furthermore, DebugTA utilizes tool calls to align the standard code with the erroneous code as much as possible, allowing the LLM to focus on logic errors within the erroneous code and improving the accuracy of the generated suggestions. To rigorously assess the quality of modification suggestions, we introduce a student simulator-teacher interaction paradigm. Experimental results on three real-world code datasets demonstrate that DebugTA consistently improves teaching effectiveness while significantly reducing computational costs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Agentic Systems in Radiology: Design, Applications, Evaluation, and Challenges](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09404v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Building agents, systems that perceive and act upon their environment with a degree of autonomy, has long been a focus of AI research. This pursuit has recently become vastly more practical with the emergence of large language models (LLMs) capable of using natural language to integrate information, follow instructions, and perform forms of "reasoning" and planning across a wide range of tasks. With its multimodal data streams and orchestrated workflows spanning multiple systems, radiology is uniquely suited to benefit from agents that can adapt to context and automate repetitive yet complex tasks. In radiology, LLMs and their multimodal variants have already demonstrated promising performance for individual tasks such as information extraction and report summarization. However, using LLMs in isolation underutilizes their potential to support complex, multi-step workflows where decisions depend on evolving context from multiple information sources. Equipping LLMs with external tools and feedback mechanisms enables them to drive systems that exhibit a spectrum of autonomy, ranging from semi-automated workflows to more adaptive agents capable of managing complex processes. This review examines the design of such LLM-driven agentic systems, highlights key applications, discusses evaluation methods for planning and tool use, and outlines challenges such as error cascades, tool-use efficiency, and health IT integration.</p></details> |  |

However, the open wireless environment, dynamic topology, and resource constraints of UAVs expose low-altitude networks to severe DoS threats. Traditional defense approaches, which rely on fixed configurations or centralized decision-making, cannot effectively respond to the rapidly changing conditions in UAV swarm environments. To address these challenges, we propose a novel federated multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (FMADRL)-driven moving target defense (MTD) framework for proactive DoS mitigation in low-altitude networks. Specifically, we design lightweight and coordinated MTD mechanisms, including leader switching, route mutation, and frequency hopping, to disrupt attacker efforts and enhance network resilience. The defense problem is formulated as a multi-agent partially observable Markov decision process, capturing the uncertain nature of UAV swarms under attack. Each UAV is equipped with a policy agent that autonomously selects MTD actions based on partial observations and local experiences. By employing a policy gradient-based algorithm, UAVs collaboratively optimize their policies via reward-weighted aggregation. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to a 34.6% improvement in attack mitigation rate, a reduction in average recovery time of up to 94.6%, and decreases in energy consumption and defense cost by as much as 29.3% and 98.3%, respectively, under various DoS attack strategies. These results highlight the potential of intelligent, distributed defense mechanisms to protect low-altitude networks, paving the way for reliable and scalable low-altitude economy.</p></details> | <details><summary>15pag...</summary><p>15pages; Minor Revision for IEEE TCCN</p></details> |

We introduce SusBench, an online benchmark for evaluating the susceptibility of CUAs to UI dark patterns, designs that aim to manipulate or deceive users into taking unintentional actions. Drawing nine common dark pattern types from existing taxonomies, we developed a method for constructing believable dark patterns on real-world consumer websites through code injections, and designed 313 evaluation tasks across 55 websites. Our study with 29 participants showed that humans perceived our dark pattern injections to be highly realistic, with the vast majority of participants not noticing that these had been injected by the research team. We evaluated five state-of-the-art CUAs on the benchmark. We found that both human participants and agents are particularly susceptible to the dark patterns of Preselection, Trick Wording, and Hidden Information, while being resilient to other overt dark patterns. Our findings inform the development of more trustworthy CUAs, their use as potential human proxies in evaluating deceptive designs, and the regulation of an online environment increasingly navigated by autonomous agents.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing agents remain limited to static planning and brittle interactions, falling short of true collaboration or adaptive reasoning. We introduce ProSEA, a modular, general-purpose multi-agent framework designed for iterative problem solving through exploration and plan evolution. ProSEA features a hierarchical architecture in which a Manager Agent orchestrates domain-specialized Expert Agents, decomposes tasks, and adaptively replans based on structured feedback from failed attempts. Unlike prior systems, ProSEA agents report not only success or failure but also detailed reasons for failure and newly discovered constraints, enabling dynamic plan refinement informed by exploratory traces. The framework operates autonomously but supports seamless integration with human collaborators when needed. Experiments on the challenging FinanceBench benchmark demonstrate that ProSEA, even without human feedback, outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and achieves robust performance across reasoning-heavy tasks. These results underscore ProSEA's potential as a foundation for more transparent, adaptive, and human-aligned AI agents.</p></details> |  |

However, backdoor attacks are typically detectable by safety audits that analyze the reasoning process of agents. To this end, we propose a novel backdoor implantation strategy called \textbf{Dynamically Encrypted Multi-Backdoor Implantation Attack}. Specifically, we introduce dynamic encryption, which maps the backdoor into benign content, effectively circumventing safety audits. To enhance stealthiness, we further decompose the backdoor into multiple sub-backdoor fragments. Based on these advancements, backdoors are allowed to bypass safety audits significantly. Additionally, we present AgentBackdoorEval, a dataset designed for the comprehensive evaluation of agent backdoor attacks. Experimental results across multiple datasets demonstrate that our method achieves an attack success rate nearing 100\% while maintaining a detection rate of 0\%, illustrating its effectiveness in evading safety audits. Our findings highlight the limitations of existing safety mechanisms in detecting advanced attacks, underscoring the urgent need for more robust defenses against backdoor threats.

Existing benchmarks rely on surface-level metrics that fail to capture the distinctive traits of this genre. To address these gaps, we introduce DITING, the first comprehensive evaluation framework for web novel translation, assessing narrative and cultural fidelity across six dimensions: idiom translation, lexical ambiguity, terminology localization, tense consistency, zero-pronoun resolution, and cultural safety, supported by over 18K expert-annotated Chinese-English sentence pairs. We further propose AgentEval, a reasoning-driven multi-agent evaluation framework that simulates expert deliberation to assess translation quality beyond lexical overlap, achieving the highest correlation with human judgments among seven tested automatic metrics. To enable metric comparison, we develop MetricAlign, a meta-evaluation dataset of 300 sentence pairs annotated with error labels and scalar quality scores. Comprehensive evaluation of fourteen open, closed, and commercial models reveals that Chinese-trained LLMs surpass larger foreign counterparts, and that DeepSeek-V3 delivers the most faithful and stylistically coherent translations. Our work establishes a new paradigm for exploring LLM-based web novel translation and provides public resources to advance future research.</p></details> |  |

Recent advancements in LLMs have significantly enhanced their ability to perform complex reasoning, long-horizon planning, and precise tool utilization -- capabilities well aligned with structural engineering tasks such as interpreting design codes, executing load calculations, and verifying structural capacities. We present a proof-of-concept showing that most real-world structural engineering workflows can be fully automated through a training-free LLM-based multi-agent system.

Motivated by the growing interest in agentic AI and its potential trajectory toward AGI, we present a comprehensive survey on Agentic Multimodal Large Language Models (Agentic MLLMs). In this survey, we explore the emerging paradigm of agentic MLLMs, delineating their conceptual foundations and distinguishing characteristics from conventional MLLM-based agents. We establish a conceptual framework that organizes agentic MLLMs along three fundamental dimensions: (i) Agentic internal intelligence functions as the system's commander, enabling accurate long-horizon planning through reasoning, reflection, and memory; (ii) Agentic external tool invocation, whereby models proactively use various external tools to extend their problem-solving capabilities beyond their intrinsic knowledge; and (iii) Agentic environment interaction further situates models within virtual or physical environments, allowing them to take actions, adapt strategies, and sustain goal-directed behavior in dynamic real-world scenarios. To further accelerate research in this area for the community, we compile open-source training frameworks, training and evaluation datasets for developing agentic MLLMs. Finally, we review the downstream applications of agentic MLLMs and outline future research directions for this rapidly evolving field. To continuously track developments in this rapidly evolving field, we will also actively update a public repository at https://github.com/HJYao00/Awesome-Agentic-MLLMs.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces RL-Focal, a two-stage RL agent framework that routes and ensembles LLMs. First, we develop the Decider RL-agent, which learns to dynamically select an ensemble of small size ($m_i$) among $N$ LLMs ($m_i \ll N$) for incoming queries from a user-defined downstream task $i$, by maximizing both error-diversity and reasoning-performance of the selected ensemble through iterative updates of task-adaptive rewards and policy. Second, to enable effective fusion of dynamically selected LLMs, we develop the stage-2 Fusion RL-agent, which learns to resolve reasoning conflicts from different LLMs and dynamically adapts to different ensemble teams composed by the Decider Agent for different downstream tasks. Third, we introduce the focal diversity metric to better model the error correlations among multiple LLMs, further improving the generalization performance of the Decider Agent, which actively prunes the ensemble combinations. By focal diversity, we enhance performance across tasks by effectively promoting reward-aware and policy-adaptive ensemble selection and inference fusion. Extensive evaluations on five benchmarks show that RL-Focal achieves the performance improvement of 8.48\% with an ensemble of small size compared to the best individual LLM in a pool and offers stronger robustness.

| **[The Social Cost of Intelligence: Emergence, Propagation, and Amplification of Stereotypical Bias in Multi-Agent Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10943v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bias in large language models (LLMs) remains a persistent challenge, manifesting in stereotyping and unfair treatment across social groups. While prior research has primarily focused on individual models, the rise of multi-agent systems (MAS), where multiple LLMs collaborate and communicate, introduces new and largely unexplored dynamics in bias emergence and propagation. In this work, we present a comprehensive study of stereotypical bias in MAS, examining how internal specialization, underlying LLMs and inter-agent communication protocols influence bias robustness, propagation, and amplification. We simulate social contexts where agents represent different social groups and evaluate system behavior under various interaction and adversarial scenarios. Experiments on three bias benchmarks reveal that MAS are generally less robust than single-agent systems, with bias often emerging early through in-group favoritism. However, cooperative and debate-based communication can mitigate bias amplification, while more robust underlying LLMs improve overall system stability. Our findings highlight critical factors shaping fairness and resilience in multi-agent LLM systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 19 figures, Preprint.

| **[Neutral Agent-based Adversarial Policy Learning against Deep Reinforcement Learning in Multi-party Open Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10937v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has been an important machine learning paradigm for solving long-horizon sequential decision-making problems under uncertainty. By integrating deep neural networks (DNNs) into the RL framework, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has emerged, which achieved significant success in various domains. However, the integration of DNNs also makes it vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Existing adversarial attack techniques mainly focus on either directly manipulating the environment with which a victim agent interacts or deploying an adversarial agent that interacts with the victim agent to induce abnormal behaviors. While these techniques achieve promising results, their adoption in multi-party open systems remains limited due to two major reasons: impractical assumption of full control over the environment and dependent on interactions with victim agents. To enable adversarial attacks in multi-party open systems, in this paper, we redesigned an adversarial policy learning approach that can mislead well-trained victim agents without requiring direct interactions with these agents or full control over their environments. Particularly, we propose a neutral agent-based approach across various task scenarios in multi-party open systems. While the neutral agents seemingly are detached from the victim agents, indirectly influence them through the shared environment. We evaluate our proposed method on the SMAC platform based on Starcraft II and the autonomous driving simulation platform Highway-env. The experimental results demonstrate that our method can launch general and effective adversarial attacks in multi-party open systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[PoU: Proof-of-Use to Counter Tool-Call Hacking in DeepResearch Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10931v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) agents, such as recent DeepResearch-style systems, extend large language models (LLMs) with autonomous information-seeking capabilities through external tools. While reinforcement learning (RL) has enabled impressive multi-step reasoning, we identify a previously overlooked failure mode, Tool-Call Hacking, where agents inflate reward signals by issuing superficially correct tool calls without genuinely leveraging the retrieved evidence. This results in (i) mode collapse into repetitive reliance on a single source and (ii) spurious grounding, where answers are only weakly supported by cited content. To address this, we propose Proof-of-Use (PoU), an evidence-grounded RL framework that enforces verifiable causal links between retrieved evidence, reasoning traces, and final answers. PoU operationalizes this through a unified step-wise contract combining syntactic citation validation, perturbation-based sensitivity rewards, and answer-evidence alignment objectives, ensuring that tool usage remains both interpretable and functionally grounded. Across seven QA benchmarks spanning in-domain, out-of-domain, and out-of-tool-distribution settings, PoU consistently outperforms strong DeepResearch baselines in factual accuracy, evidence faithfulness, and tool-routing balance. These findings highlight the necessity of grounding RL-trained agents not merely in task outcomes but in the causal use of retrieved information, offering a principled path toward trustworthy retrieval-augmented reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[PaperArena: An Evaluation Benchmark for Tool-Augmented Agentic Reasoning on Scientific Literature](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10909v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding and reasoning on the web-scale scientific literature is a crucial touchstone for large language model (LLM) based agents designed to support complex knowledge-intensive tasks. However, existing works are mainly restricted to tool-free tasks within isolated papers, largely due to the lack of a benchmark for cross-paper reasoning and multi-tool orchestration in real research scenarios. In this work, we propose PaperArena, an evaluation benchmark for agents to address real-world research questions that typically require integrating information across multiple papers with the assistance of external tools. Given a research question, agents should integrate diverse formats across multiple papers through reasoning and interacting with appropriate tools, thereby producing a well-grounded answer. To support standardized evaluation, we provide a modular and extensible platform for agent execution, offering tools such as multimodal parsing, context retrieval, and programmatic computation. Experimental results reveal that even the most advanced LLM powering a well-established agent system achieves merely 38.78% average accuracy. On the hard subset, accuracy drops to only 18.47%, highlighting great potential for improvement. We also present several empirical findings, including that all agents tested exhibit inefficient tool usage, often invoking more tools than necessary to solve a task. We invite the community to adopt PaperArena to develop and evaluate more capable agents for scientific discovery. Our code and data are available https://github.com/Melmaphother/PaperArena.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figures |

Despite the promising potential of large language models (LLMs)-based agent for software optimization, automating compiler optimization remains challenging due to: (1) semantic misalignment between abstract program representations and concrete optimization passes, (2) inefficient interaction mechanisms between agents and compiler environments, and (3) reward sparsity from the extensive decision-making process within large optimization spaces. This paper introduces \textbf{AwareCompiler}, an agentic framework for compiler optimization that addresses these challenges through three key innovations: structured knowledge integration and dataset construction, knowledge-driven adaptive pass generation, and data-driven hybrid training pipeline. Experimental results on standard benchmarks demonstrate that AwareCompiler significantly outperforms existing baselines in both performance and efficiency, highlighting the effectiveness of our synergistic knowledge-data-driven approach.

While deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based protocols enhance task-specified network performance, they suffer from poor generalizability and resilience, demanding costly retraining to adapt to dynamic environments. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a game-theoretic LLM-empowered multi-agent DRL (MARL) framework, in which the uplink transmission between a base station and a varying number of user equipments is modeled as a dynamic multi-follower Stackelberg game (MFSG), capturing the network's natural hierarchical structure. Within this game, LLM-driven agents, coordinated through proximal policy optimization (PPO), synthesize adaptive, semantic MAC protocols in response to network dynamics. Protocol action grammar (PAG) is employed to ensure the reliability and efficiency of this process. Under this system, we further analyze the existence and convergence behavior in terms of a Stackelberg equilibrium by studying the learning dynamics of LLM-empowered unified policies in response to changing followers. Simulations corroborate that our framework achieves a 77.6% greater throughput and a 65.2% fairness improvement over conventional baselines. Besides, our framework generalizes excellently to a fluctuating number of users without requiring retraining or architectural changes.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

Building on the prior work, LLM x MapReduce-V2, this version incorporates a multi-agent architecture where individual functional components, such as skeleton initialization, digest construction, and skeleton refinement, are implemented as independent model-context-protocol (MCP) servers. These atomic servers can be aggregated into higher-level servers, creating a hierarchically structured system. A high-level planner agent dynamically orchestrates the workflow by selecting appropriate modules based on their MCP tool descriptions and the execution history. This modular decomposition facilitates human-in-the-loop intervention, affording users greater control and customization over the research process. Through a multi-turn interaction, the system precisely captures the intended research perspectives to generate a comprehensive skeleton, which is then developed into an in-depth survey.

A key challenge in this space is the continual need to migrate and modernize codebases in response to evolving software ecosystems. Traditionally, such migrations have relied on rule-based systems and human intervention. With the advent of powerful large language models (LLMs), AI-driven agentic frameworks offer a promising alternative-but their effectiveness has not been systematically evaluated. In this paper, we introduce FreshBrew, a novel benchmark for evaluating AI agents on project-level Java migrations, with a specific focus on measuring an agent's ability to preserve program semantics and avoid reward hacking, which we argue requires projects with high test coverage for a rigorous and reliable evaluation. We benchmark several state-of-the-art LLMs, and compare their performance against established rule-based tools. Our evaluation of AI agents on this benchmark of 228 repositories shows that the top-performing model, Gemini 2.5 Flash, can successfully migrate 52.3 percent of projects to JDK 17. Our empirical analysis reveals novel insights into the critical strengths and limitations of current agentic approaches, offering actionable insights into their real-world applicability. Our empirical study reveals failure modes of current AI agents in realistic Java modernization tasks, providing a foundation for evaluating trustworthy code-migration systems. By releasing FreshBrew, we aim to facilitate rigorous, reproducible evaluation and catalyze progress in AI-driven codebase modernization.</p></details> | 18 pages, 12 figures |

| **[LLMs as Strategic Agents: Beliefs, Best Response Behavior, and Emergent Heuristics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10813v1)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to domains that require reasoning about other agents' behavior, such as negotiation, policy design, and market simulation, yet existing research has mostly evaluated their adherence to equilibrium play or their exhibited depth of reasoning. Whether they display genuine strategic thinking, understood as the coherent formation of beliefs about other agents, evaluation of possible actions, and choice based on those beliefs, remains unexplored. We develop a framework to identify this ability by disentangling beliefs, evaluation, and choice in static, complete-information games, and apply it across a series of non-cooperative environments. By jointly analyzing models' revealed choices and reasoning traces, and introducing a new context-free game to rule out imitation from memorization, we show that current frontier models exhibit belief-coherent best-response behavior at targeted reasoning depths. When unconstrained, they self-limit their depth of reasoning and form differentiated conjectures about human and synthetic opponents, revealing an emergent form of meta-reasoning. Under increasing complexity, explicit recursion gives way to internally generated heuristic rules of choice that are stable, model-specific, and distinct from known human biases. These findings indicate that belief coherence, meta-reasoning, and novel heuristic formation can emerge jointly from language modeling objectives, providing a structured basis for the study of strategic cognition in artificial agents.</p></details> |  |

Prompt-as-Policy over Knowledge Graphs for Cold-start Next POI Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08012v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Next point-of-interest (POI) recommendation is crucial for smart urban services such as tourism, dining, and transportation, yet most approaches struggle under cold-start conditions where user-POI interactions are sparse. Recent efforts leveraging large language models (LLMs) address this challenge through either supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or in-context learning (ICL). However, SFT demands costly annotations and fails to generalize to inactive users, while static prompts in ICL cannot adapt to diverse user contexts. To overcome these limitations, we propose Prompt-as-Policy over knowledge graphs, a reinforcement-guided prompting framework that learns to construct prompts dynamically through contextual bandit optimization. Our method treats prompt construction as a learnable policy that adaptively determines (i) which relational evidences to include, (ii) the number of evidence per candidate, and (iii) their organization and ordering within prompts. More specifically, we construct a knowledge graph (KG) to discover candidates and mine relational paths, which are transformed into evidence cards that summarize rationales for each candidate POI. The frozen LLM then acts as a reasoning engine, generating recommendations from the KG-discovered candidate set based on the policy-optimized prompts. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that Prompt-as-Policy consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving average 7.7\% relative improvements in Acc@1 for inactive users, while maintaining competitive performance on active users, without requiring model fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |

This paper investigates the role of long Chain-of-Thought (long CoT) data in enhancing the reasoning abilities of such MLLMs. Our findings demonstrate that Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with long CoT data significantly improves MLLM reasoning. Furthermore, we observe that after this initial SFT phase, MLLMs can achieve additional performance gains through a subsequent RL stage. We conclude that a SFT stage with long CoT data is a critical prerequisite for developing the reasoning capabilities of lightweight MLLMs.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we challenge whether high SFT scores translate to improved performance after RL. We provide extensive counter-examples where this is not true. We find high SFT scores can be biased toward simpler or more homogeneous data and are not reliably predictive of subsequent RL gains or scaled-up post-training effectiveness. In some cases, RL training on models with improved SFT performance could lead to substantially worse outcome compared to RL on the base model without SFT. We study alternative metrics and identify generalization loss on held-out reasoning examples and Pass@large k performance to provide strong proxies for the RL outcome. We trained hundreds of models up to 12B-parameter with SFT and RLVR via GRPO and ran extensive evaluations on 7 math benchmarks with up to 256 repetitions, spending $>$1M GPU hours. Experiments include models from Llama3, Mistral-Nemo, Qwen3 and multiple state-of-the-art SFT/RL datasets. Compared to directly predicting from pre-RL performance, prediction based on generalization loss and Pass@large k achieves substantial higher precision, improving $R^2$ coefficient and Spearman's rank correlation coefficient by up to 0.5 (2x). This provides strong utility for broad use cases. For example, in most experiments, we find SFT training on unique examples for a one epoch underperforms training on half examples for two epochs, either after SFT or SFT-then-RL; With the same SFT budget, training only on short examples may lead to better SFT performance, though, it often leads to worse outcome after RL compared to training on examples with varying lengths. Evaluation tool will be open-sourced.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint. Under Review</p></details> |

We address this practical reliability gap by creating PureTC-1B, a three-stage stabilization pipeline for Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct (an open-weight, instruction-tuned model released by Meta) using parameter-efficient LoRA adapters. Our method combines Continual Pre-Training (CPT) on TC-centric corpora, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with instruction data, and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) using TC-adherence preferences to improve monolingual robustness without full-model retraining. On a benchmark designed to simulate real-world usage, PureTC-1B achieves a 51.3% relative reduction (micro-average) in non-TC output tokens versus the base model. On a Named Entity Translation (NET) task, PureTC-1B further reduces incorrect-language tokens by 77.2% relative to Llama-3B and 57.2% relative to Qwen-1.5B, indicating that robust TC adherence is attainable even at the 1B scale. The pipeline is reproducible, adapter-only, and hardware-friendly, offering practitioners a practical recipe to enhance language stability for TC and potentially other non-English languages.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 1 figures, 2 tables.

| **[Debunk the Myth of SFT Generalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00237v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A prevailing view holds that supervised fine-tuning (SFT) memorizes training data and fails to generalize, whereas reinforcement learning (RL) attains broader robustness. We revisit this claim through a systematic evaluation on two decision-making benchmarks, Sokoban and General Points, and arrive at a different conclusion. We show that much of SFT's perceived failure stems from frozen-prompt artifacts: when trained on fixed instruction templates, SFT models cling to training semantics rather than adapting to new ones. Introducing prompt diversity during training breaks this shortcut and yields strong generalization to unseen instruction variants without harming in-distribution performance. Beyond instruction shifts, we ask whether SFT can generalize to strictly harder tasks. Here, chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision provides an algorithmic scaffold that markedly improves transfer to more difficult regimes, such as larger Sokoban grids with additional boxes and arithmetic with out-of-distribution values or five-card compositions that increase combinatorial complexity. Finally, combining prompt diversity with CoT achieves the best of both worlds: robust generalization across both instruction-variant and difficulty-variant settings, matching or surpassing RL baselines on our benchmarks while retaining SFT's simplicity and stability. These findings challenge the narrative that SFT is inherently inferior to RL and support a data-centric perspective: with appropriately curated demonstrations, vanilla SFT can generalize as strongly as RL.

| **[Guard Vector: Beyond English LLM Guardrails with Task-Vector Composition and Streaming-Aware Prefix SFT](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23381v1)** | 2025-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Guard Vector, a safety task vector computed as the parameter difference between a guardrail model (Guard Model) and a same-architecture pretrained language model. Composing this vector with a target language model yields a Target Guard Model (TGM). We then adapt TGM with a streaming-aware approach that combines prefix-based training and evaluation with a classifier that produces a single-token output. With this composition alone, TGM improves classification quality over established Guard Models across standard safety suites and enables language extensibility to Chinese, Japanese, and Korean, requiring neither additional training nor target language labels. It also demonstrates model portability across two widely used public guardrail backbones, Llama and Gemma. With prefix SFT (supervised fine-tuning), TGM preserves classification quality under streaming by aligning the behavior between prefix inputs and full-text inputs. The single-token output design increases throughput and reduces latency. Together, these components reduce data and compute requirements while promoting streaming-aware evaluation practices, thereby contributing to a more responsible AI ecosystem.</p></details> |  |
| **[RL Squeezes, SFT Expands: A Comparative Study of Reasoning LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21128v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are typically trained by reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rewards (RLVR) and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on reasoning traces to improve their reasoning abilities. However, how these methods shape reasoning capabilities remains largely elusive. Going beyond an accuracy-based investigation of how these two components sculpt the reasoning process, this paper introduces a novel analysis framework that quantifies reasoning paths and captures their qualitative changes under each training process (with models of 1.5B, 7B, and 14B parameters on mathematical domains). Specifically, we investigate the reasoning process at two levels of granularity: the trajectory-level, which examines complete reasoning outputs, and the step-level, which analyzes reasoning graphs whose nodes correspond to individual reasoning steps. Notably, clustering of unique reasoning trajectories shows complementary effects: RL compresses incorrect trajectories, whereas SFT expands correct ones. Step-level analysis reveals that RL steepens (about 2.5 times), while SFT flattens (reduced to about one-third), the decay rates of node visitation frequency, degree, and betweenness centrality distributions in the reasoning graph. This indicates that RL concentrates reasoning functionality into a small subset of steps, while SFT homogenizes it across many steps. Furthermore, by evaluating the reasoning graph topologies from multiple perspectives, we delineate the shared and distinct characteristics of RL and SFT. Our work presents a novel reasoning path perspective that explains why the current best practice of two-stage training, with SFT followed by RL, is successful, and offers practical implications for data construction and more efficient learning approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[SFT Doesn't Always Hurt General Capabilities: Revisiting Domain-Specific Fine-Tuning in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20758v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on domain-specific datasets is a common approach to adapt Large Language Models (LLMs) to specialized tasks but is often believed to degrade their general capabilities. In this work, we revisit this trade-off and present both empirical and theoretical insights. First, we show that SFT does not always hurt: using a smaller learning rate can substantially mitigate general performance degradation while preserving comparable target-domain performance. We then provide a theoretical analysis that explains these phenomena and further motivates a new method, Token-Adaptive Loss Reweighting (TALR). Building on this, and recognizing that smaller learning rates alone do not fully eliminate general-performance degradation in all cases, we evaluate a range of strategies for reducing general capability loss, including L2 regularization, LoRA, model averaging, FLOW, and our proposed TALR. Experimental results demonstrate that while no method completely eliminates the trade-off, TALR consistently outperforms these baselines in balancing domain-specific gains and general capabilities. Finally, we distill our findings into practical guidelines for adapting LLMs to new domains: (i) using a small learning rate to achieve a favorable trade-off, and (ii) when a stronger balance is further desired, adopt TALR as an effective strategy.</p></details> |  |

However, the evolution and mechanism behind the synergy of SFT and RL are still under-explored and inconclusive. In our study, we find the well-known claim "SFT memorizes, RL generalizes" is over-simplified, and discover that: (1) OOD performance peaks at the early stage of SFT and then declines (OOD forgetting), the best SFT checkpoint cannot be captured by training/test loss; (2) the subsequent RL stage does not generate fundamentally better OOD capability, instead it plays an \textbf{OOD restoration} role, recovering the lost reasoning ability during SFT; (3) The recovery ability has boundaries, \ie{} \textbf{if SFT trains for too short or too long, RL cannot recover the lost OOD ability;} (4) To uncover the underlying mechanisms behind the forgetting and restoration process, we employ SVD analysis on parameter matrices, manually edit them, and observe their impacts on model performance. Unlike the common belief that the shift of model capacity mainly results from the changes of singular values, we find that they are actually quite stable throughout fine-tuning. Instead, the OOD behavior strongly correlates with the \textbf{rotation of singular vectors}. Our findings re-identify the roles of SFT and RL in the two-stage fine-tuning and discover the rotation of singular vectors as the key mechanism. %reversing the rotations induced by SFT, which shows recovery from forgetting, whereas imposing the SFT parameter directions onto a RL-tuned model results in performance degradation.

| **[Beyond Two-Stage Training: Cooperative SFT and RL for LLM Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06948v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven effective in incentivizing the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), but suffers from severe efficiency challenges due to its trial-and-error nature. While the common practice employs supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a warm-up stage for RL, this decoupled two-stage approach limits interaction between SFT and RL, thereby constraining overall effectiveness. This study introduces a novel method for learning reasoning models that employs bilevel optimization to facilitate better cooperation between these training paradigms. By conditioning the SFT objective on the optimal RL policy, our approach enables SFT to meta-learn how to guide RL's optimization process. During training, the lower level performs RL updates while simultaneously receiving SFT supervision, and the upper level explicitly maximizes the cooperative gain-the performance advantage of joint SFT-RL training over RL alone. Empirical evaluations on five reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms baselines and achieves a better balance between effectiveness and efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Blockwise SFT for Diffusion Language Models: Reconciling Bidirectional Attention and Autoregressive Decoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19529v1)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Discrete diffusion language models have shown strong potential for text generation, yet standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT) misaligns with their semi-autoregressive inference: training randomly masks tokens across the entire response, while inference generates fixed-size blocks sequentially. This mismatch introduces noisy prefixes and leaky suffixes, biasing gradients away from the desired blockwise likelihood. We propose Blockwise SFT, which partitions responses into fixed-size blocks, selects one active block per step for stochastic masking, freezes all preceding tokens, and fully hides future ones. Loss is computed only over the active block, directly mirroring the blockwise decoding process. Experiments on GSM8K, MATH, and MetaMathQA show consistent gains over classical SFT under equal compute or token budgets. Block size consistency studies and ablations confirm that improvements stem from faithful training-inference alignment rather than incidental masking effects. Our results highlight the importance of matching supervision granularity to the decoding procedure in diffusion-based language models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Breaking the SFT Plateau: Multimodal Structured Reinforcement Learning for Chart-to-Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13587v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While reinforcement learning (RL) has proven highly effective for general reasoning in vision-language models, its application to tasks requiring in-depth understanding of information-rich images and generation of structured outputs remains underexplored. Chart-to-code generation exemplifies this challenge, demanding complex reasoning over visual charts to generate structured code. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) alone is often insufficient, highlighting the need for effective RL strategies that appropriately reward structured outputs. We systematically investigate the performance plateau in SFT through large-scale experiments and propose Multimodal Structured Reinforcement Learning (MSRL) for chart-to-code generation, which substantially breaks through this plateau. We construct the largest training corpus to date, containing 3 million chart-code pairs from real-world arXiv tables to mitigate simplistic patterns of prior synthetic data. Despite reaching state-of-the-art performance, our experiments show that scaling SFT data eventually hits a plateau where further increases yield negligible improvements. Our MSRL method leverages a multi-granularity structured reward system using multimodal textual and visual feedback. At the textual level, rule-based rewards validate fine-grained code details. At the visual level, model-based rewards assess structural similarity by rendering generated code into images and employing an evaluator model. We implement this within a two-stage curriculum for training stability. Results demonstrate that MSRL significantly breaks the SFT plateau, improving high-level metrics by 6.2% and 9.9% on ChartMimic and ReachQA benchmarks respectively, achieving competitive performance with advanced closed-source models.</p></details> | technical report |

Through mathematical analysis, we reveal that standard SFT gradients implicitly encode a problematic reward structure that may severely restrict the generalization capabilities of model. To rectify this, we propose Dynamic Fine-Tuning (DFT), stabilizing gradient updates for each token by dynamically rescaling the objective function with the probability of this token. Remarkably, this single-line code change significantly outperforms standard SFT across multiple challenging benchmarks and base models, demonstrating greatly improved generalization. Additionally, our approach shows competitive results in offline RL settings, offering an effective yet simpler alternative. This work bridges theoretical insight and practical solutions, substantially advancing SFT performance.

Two particularly popular approaches are reinforcement learning (RL) and supervised fine-tuning (SFT), but their training dynamics are poorly understood. We present a comparative analysis of RL and SFT on the same maths problems with the same model and similar hyperparameters. We find that RL yields minor in-domain gains on maths and slight degradation on knowledge-intensive benchmarks like MMLU, while both trends are more pronounced in SFT. We also analyse model parameters across checkpoints, observing that both algorithms modify query and key weights the most. Meanwhile, SFT exhibits greater updates and also affects mid-layer MLPs more, leading us to hypothesise that this may have caused the out-of-domain degradation. We therefore investigate whether freezing parts of the model during training can mitigate the reduced performance on knowledge-intensive benchmarks. However, our results are inconclusive, with benefits on GPQA:Diamond and degradation on other benchmarks. Taken together, our observations provide a preliminary indication for why RL amplifies existing capabilities, while SFT replaces old skills with new ones.</p></details> |  |

While text-based reasoning models (e.g., Deepseek R1) show promising results in text-only tasks, distilling their reasoning into LVLMs via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) often results in performance degradation due to imprecise visual grounding. Conversely, purely reinforcement learning (RL)-based methods face a large search space, hindering the emergence of reflective behaviors in smaller models (e.g., 7B LVLMs). Surprisingly, alternating between SFT and RL ultimately results in significant performance improvements after a few iterations. Our analysis reveals that the base model rarely exhibits reasoning behaviors initially, but SFT effectively surfaces these latent actions and narrows the RL search space, accelerating the development of reasoning capabilities. Each subsequent RL stage further refines the model's reasoning skills, producing higher-quality SFT data for continued self-improvement. OpenVLThinker-7B consistently advances performance across six benchmarks demanding mathematical and general reasoning, notably improving MathVista by 3.8%, EMMA by 2.4%, and HallusionBench by 1.6%. Beyond demonstrating the synergy between SFT and RL for complex reasoning tasks, our findings provide early evidence towards achieving R1-style reasoning in multimodal contexts.

While Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) are the dominant training paradigms, a systematic methodology for combining them to maximize both accuracy and efficiency remains largely unexplored. This paper introduces a practical and effective training recipe that strategically integrates extended SFT with RL from online inference (GRPO). We posit that these methods play complementary, not competing, roles: a prolonged SFT phase first pushes the model's accuracy to its limits, after which a GRPO phase dramatically improves token efficiency while preserving this peak performance. Our experiments reveal that extending SFT for as many as 10 epochs is crucial for performance breakthroughs, and that the primary role of GRPO in this framework is to optimize solution length. The efficacy of our recipe is rigorously validated through top-tier performance on challenging benchmarks, including a high rank among over 2,200 teams in the strictly leak-free AI Mathematical Olympiad (AIMO). This work provides the community with a battle-tested blueprint for developing state-of-the-art mathematical reasoners that are both exceptionally accurate and practically efficient. To ensure full reproducibility and empower future research, we will open-source our entire framework, including all code, model checkpoints, and training configurations at https://github.com/analokmaus/kaggle-aimo2-fast-math-r1.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at ICML 2025 Workshop on The second AI for MATH</p></details> |
| **[The Synergy Dilemma of Long-CoT SFT and RL: Investigating Post-Training Techniques for Reasoning VLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07562v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large vision-language models (VLMs) increasingly adopt post-training techniques such as long chain-of-thought (CoT) supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) to elicit sophisticated reasoning. While these methods exhibit synergy in language-only models, their joint effectiveness in VLMs remains uncertain. We present a systematic investigation into the distinct roles and interplay of long-CoT SFT and RL across multiple multimodal reasoning benchmarks. We find that SFT improves performance on difficult questions by in-depth, structured reasoning, but introduces verbosity and degrades performance on simpler ones. In contrast, RL promotes generalization and brevity, yielding consistent improvements across all difficulty levels, though the improvements on the hardest questions are less prominent compared to SFT. Surprisingly, combining them through two-staged, interleaved, or progressive training strategies, as well as data mixing and model merging, all fails to produce additive benefits, instead leading to trade-offs in accuracy, reasoning style, and response length. This ``synergy dilemma'' highlights the need for more seamless and adaptive approaches to unlock the full potential of combined post-training techniques for reasoning VLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Implicit Reward as the Bridge: A Unified View of SFT and DPO Connections](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00018v2)** | 2025-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Post-training processes are essential phases in grounding pre-trained language models to real-world tasks, with learning from demonstrations or preference signals playing a crucial role in this adaptation. We present a unified theoretical framework bridging Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and preference learning in Large Language Model (LLM) post-training. Through rigorous mathematical derivation, we demonstrate that both SFT and preference learning methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) operate within the same optimal policy-reward subspace, with SFT representing a special case of implicit reward learning. Our analysis reveals a critical limitation in conventional SFT: the KL divergence term in distribution matching becomes constant with respect to the policy during optimization, failing to constrain model updates. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective learning rate reduction approach that yields significant performance improvements (up to \textbf{25\%} relative gain and \textbf{6\%} absolute win rate increase in instruction following tasks. Additionally, we derive alternative SFT objectives from various f-divergence functions that preserve the KL term during optimization, further enhancing post-DPO model performance. Finally, we extend the theoretical relationship between LLM logits and Q-functions from preference learning to the SFT context, providing mathematical derivations and experimental validation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bridging SFT and DPO for Diffusion Model Alignment with Self-Sampling Preference Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05255v2)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing post-training techniques are broadly categorized into supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) methods; the former is stable during training but suffers from limited generalization, while the latter, despite its stronger generalization capability, relies on additional preference data or reward models and carries the risk of reward exploitation. In order to preserve the advantages of both SFT and RL -- namely, eliminating the need for paired data and reward models while retaining the training stability of SFT and the generalization ability of RL -- a new alignment method, Self-Sampling Preference Optimization (SSPO), is proposed in this paper. SSPO introduces a Random Checkpoint Replay (RCR) strategy that utilizes historical checkpoints to construct paired data, thereby effectively mitigating overfitting. Simultaneously, a Self-Sampling Regularization (SSR) strategy is employed to dynamically evaluate the quality of generated samples; when the generated samples are more likely to be winning samples, the approach automatically switches from DPO (Direct Preference Optimization) to SFT, ensuring that the training process accurately reflects the quality of the samples. Experimental results demonstrate that SSPO not only outperforms existing methods on text-to-image benchmarks, but its effectiveness has also been validated in text-to-video tasks. We validate SSPO across both text-to-image and text-to-video benchmarks. SSPO surpasses all previous approaches on the text-to-image benchmarks and demonstrates outstanding performance on the text-to-video benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

However, existing approaches often fall short: methods solely employing reinforcement learning (RL) can struggle with sample inefficiency and activating entirely absent reasoning capabilities, while conventional pipelines that initiate with a cold-start supervised fine-tuning (SFT) phase before RL may restrict the model's exploratory capacity and face suboptimal convergence. In this work, we introduce \textbf{Metis-RISE} (\textbf{R}L \textbf{I}ncentivizes and \textbf{S}FT \textbf{E}nhances) for multimodal reasoning model learning. Unlike conventional approaches, Metis-RISE distinctively omits an initial SFT stage, beginning instead with an RL phase (e.g., using a Group Relative Policy Optimization variant) to incentivize and activate the model's latent reasoning capacity. Subsequently, the targeted SFT stage addresses two key challenges identified during RL: (1) \textit{inefficient trajectory sampling} for tasks where the model possesses but inconsistently applies correct reasoning, which we tackle using self-distilled reasoning trajectories from the RL model itself; and (2) \textit{fundamental capability absence}, which we address by injecting expert-augmented knowledge for prompts where the model entirely fails. This strategic application of RL for incentivization followed by SFT for enhancement forms the core of Metis-RISE, leading to two versions of our MLLMs (7B and 72B parameters). Evaluations on the OpenCompass Multimodal Reasoning Leaderboard demonstrate that both models achieve state-of-the-art performance among similar-sized models, with the 72B version ranking fourth overall.

| **[BREAD: Branched Rollouts from Expert Anchors Bridge SFT & RL for Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17211v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Small language models (SLMs) struggle to learn complex reasoning behaviors, especially when high-quality traces are scarce or difficult to learn from. The standard training approach combines a supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage, often to distill capabilities of a larger model, followed by a reinforcement learning (RL)stage such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). In this paper, we investigate the fundamental limitations of this SFT + RL paradigm and propose methods to overcome them. Under a suitable theoretical model, we demonstrate that the SFT + RL strategy can fail completely when (1) the expert's traces are too difficult for the small model to express, or (2) the small model's initialization has exponentially small likelihood of success. To address these, we introduce BREAD: a GRPO variant that unifies the SFT and RL stages via partial expert guidance and branched rollouts. When self-generated traces fail, BREAD adaptively inserts short expert prefixes/hints, allowing the small model to complete the rest of the reasoning path, and ensuring that each update includes at least one successful trace. This mechanism both densifies the reward signal and induces a natural learning curriculum. BREAD requires fewer than 40% of ground-truth traces, consistently outperforming standard GRPO while speeding up the training by about 3 times. Importantly, we demonstrate that BREAD helps the model solve problems that are otherwise unsolvable by the SFT + RL strategy, highlighting how branched rollouts and expert guidance can substantially boost SLM reasoning.</p></details> |  |

We begin by curating the SFT training data through two scaling strategies: increasing the number of collected prompts and the number of generated responses per prompt. Both approaches yield notable improvements in reasoning performance, with scaling the number of prompts resulting in more substantial gains. We then explore the following questions regarding the synergy between SFT and RL: (i) Does a stronger SFT model consistently lead to better final performance after large-scale RL training? (ii) How can we determine an appropriate sampling temperature during RL training to effectively balance exploration and exploitation for a given SFT initialization? Our findings suggest that (i) holds true, provided effective RL training is conducted, particularly when the sampling temperature is carefully chosen to maintain the temperature-adjusted entropy around 0.3, a setting that strikes a good balance between exploration and exploitation. Notably, the performance gap between initial SFT models narrows significantly throughout the RL process. Leveraging a strong SFT foundation and insights into the synergistic interplay between SFT and RL, our AceReason-Nemotron-1.1 7B model significantly outperforms AceReason-Nemotron-1.0 and achieves new state-of-the-art performance among Qwen2.5-7B-based reasoning models on challenging math and code benchmarks, thereby demonstrating the effectiveness of our post-training recipe.

Exploring the Interplay of SFT and RL in Enhancing LLM Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24273v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs) have effectively improved their reasoning abilities, particularly on mathematical and logical problems that have verifiable answers, through techniques such as supervised finetuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL). Prior research indicates that RL effectively internalizes search strategies, enabling long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, with backtracking emerging naturally as a learned capability. However, the precise benefits of backtracking, specifically, how significantly it contributes to reasoning improvements and the optimal extent of its use, remain poorly understood. In this work, we systematically investigate the dynamics between SFT and RL on eight reasoning tasks: Countdown, Sudoku, Arc 1D, Geometry, Color Cube Rotation, List Functions, Zebra Puzzles, and Self Reference. Our findings highlight that short CoT sequences used in SFT as a warm-up do have moderate contribution to RL training, compared with cold-start RL; however such contribution diminishes when tasks become increasingly difficult. Motivated by this observation, we construct synthetic datasets varying systematically in the number of backtracking steps and conduct controlled experiments to isolate the influence of either the correctness (content) or the structure (i.e., backtrack frequency). We find that (1) longer CoT with backtracks generally induce better and more stable RL training, (2) more challenging problems with larger search space tend to need higher numbers of backtracks during the SFT stage. Additionally, we demonstrate through experiments on distilled data that RL training is largely unaffected by the correctness of long CoT sequences, suggesting that RL prioritizes structural patterns over content correctness. Collectively, our results offer practical insights into designing optimal training strategies to effectively scale reasoning in LLMs.</p></details> |  |

However, their roles in enhancing model generalization capabilities remain unclear. This paper studies the difference between SFT and RL on generalization and memorization, focusing on text-based rule variants and visual variants. We introduce GeneralPoints, an arithmetic reasoning card game, and adopt V-IRL, a real-world navigation environment, to assess how models trained with SFT and RL generalize to unseen variants in both textual and visual domains. We show that RL, especially when trained with an outcome-based reward, generalizes across both rule-based textual and visual variants. SFT, in contrast, tends to memorize training data and struggles to generalize out-of-distribution scenarios. Further analysis reveals that RL improves the model's underlying visual recognition capabilities, contributing to its enhanced generalization in the visual domain. Despite RL's superior generalization, we show that SFT remains essential for effective RL training; SFT stabilizes the model's output format, enabling subsequent RL to achieve its performance gains. These findings demonstrates the capability of RL for acquiring generalizable knowledge in complex, multi-modal tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website at https://tianzhechu.com/SFTvsRL</p></details> |

In this work, we propose SOAEsV2-7B/72B, a specialized LLM series developed via a three-phase framework: 1) continual pre-training integrates domain knowledge while retaining base capabilities; 2) domain-progressive SFT employs curriculum-based learning strategy, transitioning from weakly relevant conversational data to expert-annotated SOAEs datasets to optimize domain-specific tasks; 3) distillation-enhanced speculative decoding accelerates inference via logit distillation between 72B target and 7B draft models, achieving 1.39-1.52$\times$ speedup without quality loss. Experimental results demonstrate that our domain-specific pre-training phase maintains 99.8% of original general language capabilities while significantly improving domain performance, resulting in a 1.08$\times$ improvement in Rouge-1 score and a 1.17$\times$ enhancement in BLEU-4 score. Ablation studies further show that domain-progressive SFT outperforms single-stage training, achieving 1.02$\times$ improvement in Rouge-1 and 1.06$\times$ in BLEU-4. Our work introduces a comprehensive, full-pipeline approach for optimizing SOAEs LLMs, bridging the gap between general language capabilities and domain-specific expertise.</p></details> |  |

With the rapid scaling of Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly through reinforcement learning (RL), there is a growing need for more capable discriminators. Consequently, advances in classification are becoming increasingly vital for enhancing the overall capabilities of LLMs. Traditional discriminative methods map text to labels but overlook LLMs' intrinsic generative strengths. Generative classification addresses this by prompting the model to directly output labels. However, existing studies still rely on simple SFT alone, seldom probing the interplay between training and inference prompts, and no work has systematically leveraged RL for generative text classifiers and unified SFT, RL, and inference-time prompting in one framework. We bridge this gap with GenCLS++, a framework that jointly optimizes SFT and RL while systematically exploring five high-level strategy dimensions-in-context learning variants, category definitions, explicit uncertainty labels, semantically irrelevant numeric labels, and perplexity-based decoding-during both training and inference. After an SFT "policy warm-up," we apply RL with a simple rule-based reward, yielding sizable extra gains. Across seven datasets, GenCLS++ achieves an average accuracy improvement of 3.46% relative to the naive SFT baseline; on public datasets, this improvement rises to 4.00%. Notably, unlike reasoning-intensive tasks that benefit from explicit thinking processes, we find that classification tasks perform better without such reasoning steps. These insights into the role of explicit reasoning provide valuable guidance for future LLM applications.</p></details> |  |

However, the specific capabilities enhanced through such fine-tuning remain poorly understood. In this paper, we conduct a detailed analysis of model performance on the AIME24 dataset to understand how reasoning capabilities evolve. We discover a ladder-like structure in problem difficulty, categorize questions into four tiers (Easy, Medium, Hard, and Extremely Hard (Exh)), and identify the specific requirements for advancing between tiers. We find that progression from Easy to Medium tier requires adopting an R1 reasoning style with minimal SFT (500-1K instances), while Hard-level questions suffer from frequent model's errors at each step of the reasoning chain, with accuracy plateauing at around 65% despite logarithmic scaling. Exh-level questions present a fundamentally different challenge; they require unconventional problem-solving skills that current models uniformly struggle with. Additional findings reveal that carefully curated small-scale datasets offer limited advantage-scaling dataset size proves far more effective. Our analysis provides a clearer roadmap for advancing language model capabilities in mathematical reasoning.</p></details> |  |

An Early Investigation into Training R1-Like Reasoning Large Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11468v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work revisits the dominant supervised fine-tuning (SFT) then reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm for training Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), and reveals a key finding: SFT can significantly undermine subsequent RL by inducing ``pseudo reasoning paths'' imitated from expert models. While these paths may resemble the native reasoning paths of RL models, they often involve prolonged, hesitant, less informative steps, and incorrect reasoning. To systematically study this effect, we introduce VLAA-Thinking, a new multimodal dataset designed to support reasoning in LVLMs. Constructed via a six-step pipeline involving captioning, reasoning distillation, answer rewrite and verification, VLAA-Thinking comprises high-quality, step-by-step visual reasoning traces for SFT, along with a more challenging RL split from the same data source. Using this dataset, we conduct extensive experiments comparing SFT, RL and their combinations. Results show that while SFT helps models learn reasoning formats, it often locks aligned models into imitative, rigid reasoning modes that impede further learning. In contrast, building on the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a novel mixed reward module integrating both perception and cognition signals, our RL approach fosters more genuine, adaptive reasoning behavior. Notably, our model VLAA-Thinker, based on Qwen2.5VL 3B, achieves top-1 performance on Open LMM Reasoning Leaderboard (https://huggingface.co/spaces/opencompass/Open_LMM_Reasoning_Leaderboard) among 4B scale LVLMs, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art by 1.8%. We hope our findings provide valuable insights in developing reasoning-capable LVLMs and can inform future research in this area.</p></details> |  |

However, to enhance its utility and reduce potential harm, SFT and alignment are applied sequentially to the pretrained model. Due to the differing nature and objective functions of SFT and alignment, catastrophic forgetting has become a significant issue. To address this, we introduce Unified Fine-Tuning (UFT), which integrates SFT and alignment into a single training stage using the same objective and loss functions through an implicit reward function. Our experimental results demonstrate that UFT outperforms SFT on instruction-tuning data alone. Moreover, when combining instruction-tuning data with alignment data, UFT effectively prevents catastrophic forgetting across these two stages and shows a clear advantage over sequentially applying SFT and alignment. This is evident in the significant improvements observed in the \textbf{ifeval} task for instruction-following and the \textbf{truthful-qa} task for factuality. The proposed general fine-tuning framework UFT establishes an effective and efficient pretraining-UFT paradigm for LLM training.</p></details> |  |

However, existing approaches struggle with temporal reasoning due to weak temporal correspondence in the data and reliance on the next-token prediction paradigm during training. To address these limitations, we propose TEMPLE (TEMporal Preference Learning), a systematic framework that enhances Video LLMs' temporal reasoning capabilities through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). To facilitate this, we introduce an automated preference data generation pipeline that systematically constructs preference pairs by selecting videos that are rich in temporal information, designing video-specific perturbation strategies, and finally evaluating model responses on clean and perturbed video inputs. Our temporal alignment features two key innovations: curriculum learning which that progressively increases perturbation difficulty to improve model robustness and adaptability; and "Pre-SFT Alignment'', applying preference optimization before instruction tuning to prioritize fine-grained temporal comprehension. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently improves Video LLM performance across multiple benchmarks with a relatively small set of self-generated DPO data. We further analyze the transferability of DPO data across architectures and the role of difficulty scheduling in optimization. Our findings highlight our TEMPLE as a scalable and efficient complement to SFT-based methods, paving the way for developing reliable Video LLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/lscpku/TEMPLE.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bring Remote Sensing Object Detect Into Nature Language Model: Using SFT Method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08144v2)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved significant success, demonstrating remarkable capabilities in understanding various images and videos, particularly in classification and detection tasks. However, due to the substantial differences between remote sensing images and conventional optical images, these models face considerable challenges in comprehension, especially in detection tasks. Directly prompting VLMs with detection instructions often leads to unsatisfactory results. To address this issue, this letter explores the application of VLMs for object detection in remote sensing images. Specifically, we constructed supervised fine-tuning (SFT) datasets using publicly available remote sensing object detection datasets, including SSDD, HRSID, and NWPU-VHR-10. In these new datasets, we converted annotation information into JSON-compliant natural language descriptions, facilitating more effective understanding and training for the VLM. We then evaluate the detection performance of various fine-tuning strategies for VLMs and derive optimized model weights for object detection in remote sensing images. Finally, we evaluate the model's prior knowledge capabilities using natural language queries. Experimental results demonstrate that, without modifying the model architecture, remote sensing object detection can be effectively achieved using natural language alone. Additionally, the model exhibits the ability to perform certain vision question answering (VQA) tasks. Our datasets and related code will be released soon.</p></details> |  |

However, attempts to extend this success to multimodal reasoning often failed to reproduce these key characteristics. In this report, we present the first successful replication of these emergent characteristics for multimodal reasoning on only a non-SFT 2B model. Starting with Qwen2-VL-2B and applying reinforcement learning directly on the SAT dataset, our model achieves 59.47% accuracy on CVBench, outperforming the base model by approximately ~30% and exceeding both SFT setting by ~2%. In addition, we share our failed attempts and insights in attempting to achieve R1-like reasoning using RL with instruct models. aiming to shed light on the challenges involved. Our key observations include: (1) applying RL on instruct model often results in trivial reasoning trajectories, and (2) naive length reward are ineffective in eliciting reasoning capabilities.

However, RLHF has been continuously challenged by its high complexity in implementation and computation consumption. Even with recent simplifications, such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Advantage Leftover Lunch (A-LoL), the problems of over-fitting and training instability remain hindering the alignment process from the expected optimal performance. To address the existing challenges, we propose a novel simplification of RLHF from the perspective of variational inference, called $\textbf{V}$ariational $\textbf{A}$lignment with $\textbf{R}$e-weighting ($\textbf{VAR}$). More specifically, by directly minimizing the distribution gap between the learning LLM policy and the optimal solution of RLHF, we transform the alignment objective into a reward-driven re-weighted supervised fine-tuning (SFT) form, which only requires minor adjustment on the SFT loss to obtain noticeable improvement on training stability and effectiveness. On comprehensive alignment and generation benchmarks, our VAR method has numerically achieved competitive performance in LLM alignment helpfulness and harmlessness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Provably Mitigating Overoptimization in RLHF: Your SFT Loss is Implicitly an Adversarial Regularizer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16436v3)** | 2024-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aligning generative models with human preference via RLHF typically suffers from overoptimization, where an imperfectly learned reward model can misguide the generative model to output undesired responses. We investigate this problem in a principled manner by identifying the source of the misalignment as a form of distributional shift and uncertainty in learning human preferences. To mitigate overoptimization, we first propose a theoretical algorithm that chooses the best policy for an adversarially chosen reward model; one that simultaneously minimizes the maximum likelihood estimation of the loss and a reward penalty term. Here, the reward penalty term is introduced to prevent the policy from choosing actions with spurious high proxy rewards, resulting in provable sample efficiency of the algorithm under a partial coverage style condition. Moving from theory to practice, the proposed algorithm further enjoys an equivalent but surprisingly easy-to-implement reformulation. Using the equivalence between reward models and the corresponding optimal policy, the algorithm features a simple objective that combines: (i) a preference optimization loss that directly aligns the policy with human preference, and (ii) a supervised learning loss that explicitly imitates the policy with a (suitable) baseline distribution. In the context of aligning large language models (LLM), this objective fuses the direct preference optimization (DPO) loss with the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) loss to help mitigate the overoptimization towards undesired responses, for which we name the algorithm Regularized Preference Optimization (RPO). Experiments of aligning LLMs demonstrate the improved performance of RPO compared with DPO baselines. Our work sheds light on the interplay between preference optimization and SFT in tuning LLMs with both theoretical guarantees and empirical evidence.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by The Thirty-Eighth Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems. 31 pages, 7 figures</p></details> |
| **[Continual SFT Matches Multimodal RLHF with Negative Supervision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14797v1)** | 2024-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal RLHF usually happens after supervised finetuning (SFT) stage to continually improve vision-language models' (VLMs) comprehension. Conventional wisdom holds its superiority over continual SFT during this preference alignment stage. In this paper, we observe that the inherent value of multimodal RLHF lies in its negative supervision, the logit of the rejected responses. We thus propose a novel negative supervised finetuning (nSFT) approach that fully excavates these information resided. Our nSFT disentangles this negative supervision in RLHF paradigm, and continually aligns VLMs with a simple SFT loss. This is more memory efficient than multimodal RLHF where 2 (e.g., DPO) or 4 (e.g., PPO) large VLMs are strictly required. The effectiveness of nSFT is rigorously proved by comparing it with various multimodal RLHF approaches, across different dataset sources, base VLMs and evaluation metrics. Besides, fruitful of ablations are provided to support our hypothesis. We hope this paper will stimulate further research to properly align large vision language models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Getting More Juice Out of the SFT Data: Reward Learning from Human Demonstration Improves SFT for LLM Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17888v3)** | 2024-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aligning human preference and value is an important requirement for contemporary foundation models. State-of-the-art techniques such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) often consist of two stages: 1) supervised fine-tuning (SFT), where the model is fine-tuned by learning from human demonstration data; 2) Preference learning, where preference data is used to learn a reward model, which is in turn used by a reinforcement learning (RL) step to fine-tune the model. Such reward model serves as a proxy to human preference, and it is critical to guide the RL step towards improving the model quality. In this work, we argue that the SFT stage significantly benefits from learning a reward model as well. Instead of using the human demonstration data directly via supervised learning, we propose to leverage an Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) technique to simultaneously build an reward model and a policy model. This approach leads to new SFT algorithms that are not only efficient to implement, but are robust to the presence of low-quality supervised learning data. Moreover, we discover a connection between the proposed IRL based approach, and a recent line of works called Self-Play Fine-tune (SPIN). Theoretically, we show that the proposed algorithms converge to the stationary solutions of the IRL problem. Empirically, we align 1B and 7B models using proposed methods and evaluate them on a reward benchmark model and the HuggingFace Open LLM Leaderboard. The proposed methods show significant performance improvement over existing SFT approaches. Our results indicate that it is beneficial to leverage reward learning throughout the entire alignment process.</p></details> |  |

The paradigm contains supervised fine tuning and reinforce learning from human feedback. This paradigm is also used in downstream scenarios to adapt LLM to specific corpora and applications. Comparing to SFT, there are many efforts focused on RLHF and several algorithms being proposed, such as PPO, DPO, IPO, KTO, MinorDPO and etc. Meanwhile most efforts for SFT are focused on how to collect, filter and mix high quality data. In this article with insight from DPO and MinorDPO, we propose a training metric for SFT to measure the discrepancy between the optimized model and the original model, and a loss function MinorSFT that can increase the training effectiveness, and reduce the discrepancy between the optimized LLM and original LLM.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |

However, sourcing this data through human annotation is costly, and existing automated methods often fail to capture the diverse range of contextual granularity and tend to produce homogeneous data. To tackle these issues, we introduce a novel method named AugCon, capable of automatically generating context-driven SFT data across multiple levels of granularity with high diversity, quality and fidelity. AugCon begins by generating queries using the Context-Split-Tree (CST), an innovative approach for recursively deriving queries and splitting context to cover full granularity. Then, we train a scorer through contrastive learning to collaborate with CST to rank and refine queries. Finally, a synergistic integration of self-alignment and self-improving is introduced to obtain high-fidelity responses. Extensive experiments are conducted incorporating both human and automatic evaluations, encompassing a test scenario and four widely-used benchmarks in English and Chinese. The results highlight the significant advantages of AugCon in producing high diversity, quality, and fidelity SFT data against several state-of-the-art methods. All of our code, dataset, and fine-tuned model will be available at: https://github.com/quanshr/AugCon.</p></details> |  |

It typically consists of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) stages. However, RLHF faces inherent limitations stemming from a complex training setup and its tendency to align the model with implicit values that end users cannot control at run-time. Moreover, reward models in RLHF stage commonly rely on single-dimensional feedback as opposed to explicit, multifaceted signals that indicate attributes such as helpfulness, humor, and toxicity. To address these limitations, we propose SteerLM, a supervised fine-tuning method that empowers end-users to control responses during inference. SteerLM conditions responses to conform to an explicitly defined multi-dimensional set of attributes, thereby empowering a steerable AI capable of generating helpful and high-quality responses while maintaining customizability. Experiments show that SteerLM trained on open source datasets generates responses that are preferred by human and automatic evaluators to many state-of-the-art baselines trained with RLHF while being much easier to train.

However, as the number of cascades increases, the improvements in reconstruction tend to become marginal, indicating possible excess model capacity. Knowledge distillation (KD) is an emerging technique to compress these models, in which a trained deep teacher network is used to distill knowledge to a smaller student network such that the student learns to mimic the behavior of the teacher. Most KD methods focus on effectively training the student with a pre-trained teacher unaware of the student model. We propose SFT-KD-Recon, a student-friendly teacher training approach along with the student as a prior step to KD to make the teacher aware of the structure and capacity of the student and enable aligning the representations of the teacher with the student. In SFT, the teacher is jointly trained with the unfolded branch configurations of the student blocks using three loss terms - teacher-reconstruction loss, student-reconstruction loss, and teacher-student imitation loss, followed by KD of the student. We perform extensive experiments for MRI acceleration in 4x and 5x under-sampling on the brain and cardiac datasets on five KD methods using the proposed approach as a prior step. We consider the DC-CNN architecture and setup teacher as D5C5 (141765 parameters), and student as D3C5 (49285 parameters), denoting a compression of 2.87:1. Results show that (i) our approach consistently improves the KD methods with improved reconstruction performance and image quality, and (ii) the student distilled using our approach is competitive with the teacher, with the performance gap reduced from 0.53 dB to 0.03 dB.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 8 figures.

In particular we prove that all generalized Baumslag-Solitar groups (GBS) admit a strongly aperiodic SFT. Our proof is based on a structural theorem by Whyte and on two constructions of strongly aperiodic SFTs on $\mathbb{F}_n\times \mathbb{Z}$ and $BS(m,n)$ of our own. Our two constructions rely on a path-folding technique that lifts an SFT on $\mathbb{Z}^2$ inside an SFT on $\mathbb{F}_n\times \mathbb{Z}$ or an SFT on the hyperbolic plane inside an SFT on $BS(m,n)$. In the case of $\mathbb{F}_n\times \mathbb{Z}$ the path folding technique also preserves minimality, so that we get minimal strongly aperiodic SFTs on unimodular GBS groups.</p></details> | 31 pages, 13 figures |

As a consequence, if $P$ contains a recursive member, $P$ and $X$ have the exact same set of Turing degrees. On the other hand, we prove that if $X$ contains only non-recursive members, some of its members always have different but comparable degrees. This gives a fairly complete study of Turing degrees of SFTs.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1102.1189</p></details> |

| **[General Exploratory Bonus for Optimistic Exploration in RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03269v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optimistic exploration is central to improving sample efficiency in reinforcement learning with human feedback, yet existing exploratory bonus methods to incentivize exploration often fail to realize optimism. We provide a theoretical analysis showing that current formulations, under KL or $\alpha$-divergence regularization, unintentionally bias exploration toward high-probability regions of the reference model, thereby reinforcing conservative behavior instead of promoting discovery of uncertain regions. To address this pitfall, we introduce the General Exploratory Bonus (GEB), a novel theoretical framework that provably satisfies the optimism principle. GEB counteracts divergence-induced bias via reference-dependent reward regulation and unifies prior heuristic bonuses as special cases, while extending naturally across the full $\alpha$-divergence family. Empirically, GEB consistently outperforms baselines on alignment tasks across multiple divergence settings and large language model backbones. These results demonstrate that GEB offers both a principled and practical solution for optimistic exploration in RLHF.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Hidden Link Between RLHF and Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22578v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human values has recently garnered significant attention, with prominent examples including the canonical yet costly Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and the simple Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). In this work, we demonstrate that both RLHF and DPO can be interpreted from the perspective of mutual information (MI) maximization, uncovering a profound connection to contrastive learning. Within this framework, both RLHF and DPO can be interpreted as methods that performing contrastive learning based on the positive and negative samples derived from base model, leveraging the Donsker-Varadhan (DV) lower bound on MI (equivalently, the MINE estimator). Such paradigm further illuminates why RLHF may not intrinsically incentivize reasoning capacities in LLMs beyond what is already present in the base model. Building on the perspective, we replace the DV/MINE bound with the Jensen-Shannon (JS) MI estimator and propose the Mutual Information Optimization (MIO). Comprehensive theoretical analysis and extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that MIO mitigates the late-stage decline in chosen-likelihood observed in DPO, achieving competitive or superior performance across various challenging reasoning and mathematical benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Understanding Sampler Stochasticity in Training Diffusion Models for RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10767v1)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is increasingly used to fine-tune diffusion models, but a key challenge arises from the mismatch between stochastic samplers used during training and deterministic samplers used during inference. In practice, models are fine-tuned using stochastic SDE samplers to encourage exploration, while inference typically relies on deterministic ODE samplers for efficiency and stability. This discrepancy induces a reward gap, raising concerns about whether high-quality outputs can be expected during inference. In this paper, we theoretically characterize this reward gap and provide non-vacuous bounds for general diffusion models, along with sharper convergence rates for Variance Exploding (VE) and Variance Preserving (VP) Gaussian models. Methodologically, we adopt the generalized denoising diffusion implicit models (gDDIM) framework to support arbitrarily high levels of stochasticity, preserving data marginals throughout. Empirically, our findings through large-scale experiments on text-to-image models using denoising diffusion policy optimization (DDPO) and mixed group relative policy optimization (MixGRPO) validate that reward gaps consistently narrow over training, and ODE sampling quality improves when models are updated using higher-stochasticity SDE training.</p></details> |  |
| **[GREAT: Generalizable Backdoor Attacks in RLHF via Emotion-Aware Trigger Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09260v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent work has shown that RLHF is highly susceptible to backdoor attacks, poisoning schemes that inject malicious triggers in preference data. However, existing methods often rely on static, rare-token-based triggers, limiting their effectiveness in realistic scenarios. In this paper, we develop GREAT, a novel framework for crafting generalizable backdoors in RLHF through emotion-aware trigger synthesis. Specifically, GREAT targets harmful response generation for a vulnerable user subgroup characterized by both semantically violent requests and emotionally angry triggers. At the core of GREAT is a trigger identification pipeline that operates in the latent embedding space, leveraging principal component analysis and clustering techniques to identify the most representative triggers. To enable this, we present Erinyes, a high-quality dataset of over $5000$ angry triggers curated from GPT-4.1 using a principled, hierarchical, and diversity-promoting approach. Experiments on benchmark RLHF datasets demonstrate that GREAT significantly outperforms baseline methods in attack success rates, especially for unseen trigger scenarios, while largely preserving the response quality on benign inputs.</p></details> |  |
| **[OpenRLHF: An Easy-to-use, Scalable and High-performance RLHF Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11143v6)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) fine-tuned via Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) significantly improve the alignment of human-AI values, further raising the upper bound of AI capabilities, particularly in reasoning-intensive, long-context Chain-of-Thought (CoT) tasks. However, existing frameworks commonly face challenges such as inference bottlenecks and complexity barriers, which restrict their accessibility to newcomers. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{OpenRLHF}, a user-friendly, scalable, and easy-to-learn open-source RLHF framework built upon Ray, vLLM, DeepSpeed, and HuggingFace Transformers, featuring a simplified design, clear code structure, and comprehensive documentation to facilitate entry for researchers and practitioners. Experimental results show that OpenRLHF achieves superior training efficiency, with speedups ranging from 1.22x to 1.68x across different model sizes, compared to state-of-the-art frameworks. Additionally, it requires significantly fewer lines of code for implementation. OpenRLHF is publicly available at https://github.com/OpenRLHF/OpenRLHF, and has already been adopted by leading institutions to accelerate RLHF research and learning.</p></details> | update template |

However, the quality of RLHF and DPO training is seriously compromised by \textit{\textbf{C}orrupted} preference, reward \textit{\textbf{O}veroptimization}, and bias towards \textit{\textbf{V}erbosity}. To our knowledge, most existing works tackle only one of these important issues, and the few other works require much computation to estimate multiple reward models and lack theoretical guarantee of generalization ability. In this work, we propose RLHF-\textbf{COV} and DPO-\textbf{COV} algorithms that can simultaneously mitigate these three issues, in both offline and online settings. This ability is theoretically demonstrated by obtaining length-regularized generalization error rates for our DPO-COV algorithms trained on corrupted data, which match the best-known rates for simpler cases with clean data and without length regularization. Moreover, our DPO-COV algorithm is simple to implement without reward estimation, and is proved to be equivalent to our RLHF-COV algorithm, which directly implies the equivalence between the vanilla RLHF and DPO algorithms. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our DPO-COV algorithms under both offline and online settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Margin RLHF via Preference over Preferences](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22851v2)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Margin-based optimization is fundamental to improving generalization and robustness in classification tasks. In the context of reward model learning from preferences within Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), existing methods typically rely on no margins, fixed margins, or margins that are simplistic functions of preference ratings. However, such formulations often fail to account for the varying strengths of different preferences, for example some preferences are associated with larger margins between responses, or they rely on noisy margin information derived from ratings. We argue that modeling the strength of preferences can lead to better generalization and more faithful alignment. Furthermore, many existing methods that use adaptive margins assume access to accurate preference scores, which can be difficult for humans to provide reliably. We propose an approach that leverages preferences over preferences, that is annotations indicating which of two preferences reflects a stronger distinction. We use this ordinal signal to infer adaptive margins on a per-datapoint basis. We introduce an extension to Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), DPO-PoP, that incorporates adaptive margins from preference-over-preference supervision, enabling improved discriminative and generative performance. Empirically, our method outperforms vanilla DPO, DPO with fixed margins, and DPO with ground-truth margins on the UltraFeedback dataset. Additionally, we show that there is a tradeoff between discriminative and generative performance: improving test classification accuracy, particularly by correctly labeling weaker preferences at the expense of stronger ones, can lead to a decline in generative quality. To navigate this tradeoff, we propose two sampling strategies to gather preference-over-preference labels: one favoring discriminative performance and one favoring generative performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking KL Regularization in RLHF: From Value Estimation to Gradient Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01555v2)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) leverages a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence loss to stabilize training and prevent overfitting. However, in methods such as GRPO, its implementation may be guided by principles from numerical value estimation-a practice that overlooks the term's functional role as an optimization loss. To analyze this issue, we establish a unified framework that connects two seemingly distinct implementation styles: using the mathematical term $k_n$ as a detached coefficient for the policy's score function ('$k_n$ in reward') or as a direct loss function through which gradients are propagated ('$k_n$ as loss'). We show that the latter can always be analyzed via an equivalent gradient coefficient in the former, unifying the two perspectives. Through this framework, we prove that the conventional '$k_1$ in reward' (like in PPO) is the principled loss for Reverse KL (RKL) regularization. We further establish a key finding: under on-policy conditions, the '$k_2$ as loss' formulation is, in fact, gradient-equivalent to '$k_1$ in reward'. This equivalence, first proven in our work, identifies both as the theoretically sound implementations of the RKL objective. In contrast, we show that the recently adopted '$k_3$ as loss' (like in GRPO) is merely a first-order, biased approximation of the principled loss. Furthermore, we argue that common off-policy implementations of '$k_n$ as loss' methods are biased due to neglected importance sampling, and we propose a principled correction. Our findings provide a comprehensive, gradient-based rationale for choosing and correctly implementing KL regularization, paving the way for more robust and effective RLHF systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Certifiable Safe RLHF: Fixed-Penalty Constraint Optimization for Safer Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03520v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring safety is a foundational requirement for large language models (LLMs). Achieving an appropriate balance between enhancing the utility of model outputs and mitigating their potential for harm is a complex and persistent challenge. Contemporary approaches frequently formalize this problem within the framework of Constrained Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs) and employ established CMDP optimization techniques. However, these methods exhibit two notable limitations. First, their reliance on reward and cost functions renders performance highly sensitive to the underlying scoring mechanism, which must capture semantic meaning rather than being triggered by superficial keywords. Second, CMDP-based training entails tuning dual-variable, a process that is both computationally expensive and does not provide any provable safety guarantee for a fixed dual variable that can be exploitable through adversarial jailbreaks. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Certifiable Safe-RLHF (CS-RLHF) that introduces a cost model trained on a large-scale corpus to assign semantically grounded safety scores. In contrast to the lagrangian-based approach, CS-RLHF adopts a rectified penalty-based formulation. This design draws on the theory of exact penalty functions in constrained optimization, wherein constraint satisfaction is enforced directly through a suitably chosen penalty term. With an appropriately scaled penalty, feasibility of the safety constraints can be guaranteed at the optimizer, eliminating the need for dual-variable updates. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that CS-RLHF outperforms state-of-the-art LLM model responses rendering at-least 5 times efficient against nominal and jail-breaking prompts</p></details> |  |

Our study decomposes this gap into two sources: an explicit representation gap under exact optimization and an implicit representation gap under finite samples. In the exact optimization setting, we characterize how the relative capacities of the reward and policy model classes influence the final policy qualities. We show that RLHF, DPO, or online DPO can outperform one another depending on type of model mis-specifications. Notably, online DPO can outperform both RLHF and standard DPO when the reward and policy model classes are isomorphic and both mis-specified. In the approximate optimization setting, we provide a concrete construction where the ground-truth reward is implicitly sparse and show that RLHF requires significantly fewer samples than DPO to recover an effective reward model -- highlighting a statistical advantage of two-stage learning. Together, these results provide a comprehensive understanding of the performance gap between RLHF and DPO under various settings, and offer practical insights into when each method is preferred.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 5 figures.

However, its training pipeline suffers from substantial inefficiencies due to sequential multi-model dependencies (e.g., reward model depends on actor outputs) and long-tail response lengths, where a few long responses straggle the stage completion. We present OPPO, a novel, lightweight, and model-agnostic PPO-based RLHF framework that improves training efficiency by overlapping pipeline execution. OPPO introduces two novel techniques: (1) Intra-step overlap, which streams upstream model outputs (e.g., actor model) in right-sized chunks, enabling the downstream model (e.g., reward) to begin prefill while the upstream continues decoding; and (2) Inter-step overlap, which adaptively overcommits a few prompts and defers long generations to future steps, mitigating tail latency without discarding partial work. OPPO integrates easily with existing PPO implementations with a few lines of code change. Extensive evaluations show that OPPO accelerates PPO-based RLHF training by $1.8 \times-2.8 \times$ and improves GPU utilization by $1.4 \times-2.1 \times$ without compromising training convergence.</p></details> | <details><summary>Kaizh...</summary><p>Kaizhuo Yan and Yingjie Yu contributed equally to this work</p></details> |

We propose a mechanistic interpretability framework that identifies specialized neural circuits responsible for rare-event processing in reward models. Drawing from recent advances showing distributed specialization for rare tokens in language models\citep{liu2025no, liu2025emergent}, we hypothesize that reward models also develop functionally distinct circuits for longtail scenarios. Our theoretical framework establishes formal connections between circuit specialization, reward generalization bounds, and longtail performance. We introduce \textbf{Circuit-Aware Reward Training (CART)}, which uses circuit analysis to guide data augmentation, regularization, and ensemble strategies. This approach provides both theoretical insights into reward model failures and practical interventions for improving longtail robustness.</p></details> |  |

However, RLHF often suffers from reward model overoptimisation, in which models overfit to the reward function, resulting in non-generalisable policies that exploit the idiosyncrasies and peculiarities of the reward function. A common mitigation is iterated RLHF, in which reward models are repeatedly retrained with updated human feedback and policies are re-optimised. Despite its increasing adoption, the dynamics of overoptimisation in this setting remain poorly understood. In this work, we present the first comprehensive study of overoptimisation in iterated RLHF. We systematically analyse key design choices - how reward model training data is transferred across iterations, which reward function is used for optimisation, and how policies are initialised. Using the controlled AlpacaFarm benchmark, we observe that overoptimisation tends to decrease over successive iterations, as reward models increasingly approximate ground-truth preferences. However, performance gains diminish over time, and while reinitialising from the base policy is robust, it limits optimisation flexibility. Other initialisation strategies often fail to recover from early overoptimisation. These findings offer actionable insights for building more stable and generalisable RLHF pipelines.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 17 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |
| **[Avoiding $\mathbf{exp(R_{max})}$ scaling in RLHF through Preference-based Exploration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00666v3)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a pivotal technique for large language model (LLM) alignment. This paper studies the setting of online RLHF and focus on improving sample efficiency. All existing algorithms in online RLHF, whether doing passive exploration or active exploration, suffer from a sample complexity that scales exponentially with the scale of the reward function. This fundamental limitation hinders their effectiveness in scenarios with heavily skewed preferences, e.g. questions with a unique correct solution. To address this, we introduce Self-Exploring Preference-Incentive Online Preference Optimization (SE-POPO), an online RLHF algorithm that for the first time achieves a sample complexity that scales polynomially with the reward scale, answering an open problem raised by Xie et al. (2024).. Theoretically, we demonstrate that the sample complexity of SE-POPO dominates that of existing exploration algorithms. Empirically, our systematic evaluation confirms that SE-POPO is more sample-efficient than both exploratory and non-exploratory baselines, in two primary application scenarios of RLHF as well as on public benchmarks, marking a significant step forward in RLHF algorithm design. The code is available at https://github.com/MYC000801/SE-POPO.</p></details> |  |

We observe that expressions of satisfaction and dissatisfaction follow stable linguistic patterns across users, indicating that more informative supervisory signals can be extracted from free-form feedback. Building on this insight, we introduce Adaptive Reward-Following (ARF), which converts natural feedback into continuous preference trajectories and optimizes them using the novel TraceBias algorithm. Across diverse LLMs and preference domains, ARF consistently outperforms PPO and DPO, improving alignment by up to 7.6%. Our results demonstrate that continuous reward modeling provides a scalable path toward personalized and theoretically grounded RLHF.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This version adds several baselines and experiments, clarifies some ambiguous descriptions, and corrects the reported value for the ReScore result on the ALPACA task to 7.8%</p></details> |
| **[Failure Modes of Maximum Entropy RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20265v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we show that Simple Preference Optimization (SimPO) can be derived as Maximum Entropy Reinforcement Learning with length-normalized temperature, providing a theoretical foundation for this reference-free method. Motivated by SimPO's strong performance in offline preference optimization, we investigate whether Maximum Entropy RL can achieve similar results in online RLHF settings. Our experiments find that Maximum Entropy RL consistently exhibits overoptimization and unstable KL dynamics, even at very low learning rates. Unlike KL-constrained methods that maintain stable training, entropy regularization fails to prevent reward hacking and appears to correlate with overoptimization. Lastly, we discuss possible explanations for why SimPO succeeds in offline settings while Maximum Entropy RL struggles in online scenarios. Our findings suggest that reference-free approaches may face distinct challenges when applied to online or offline preference learning.</p></details> | 26 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Opal: An Operator Algebra View of RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11298v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Opal, an operator view of reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Objectives are expressed as ladders of two primitives on a base utility: additive penalties and multiplicative pairwise weights. We describe a simple reduction law with if-and-only-if conditions: such ladders collapse to a normal form on pairwise margins when the reference is fixed, penalties are additive, and weights are independent of intermediate margins. When these assumptions do not hold (reference shift, non-additive gates, score-dependent weights), small examples demonstrate non-reducibility. Building on this view, we introduce GKPO (Generalized Kernel Preference Object), a canonical schema in which many RLHF methods can be represented and, when reducible, mapped back from. GKPO provides a standard JSON serialization, canonicalization and hashing rules, and explicit flags with finite witnesses when assumptions fail. We illustrate these ideas with GKPO examples for DPO, RRHF, and ORPO, along with cross-method conversions (where assumptions permit) and minimal stress tests (SHIFT/GATE/SCORE) that highlight non-reducibility. A lightweight Python reference library accompanies the schema, implementing canonical hashing and adapters for DPO and RRHF.</p></details> | 11 pages main |
| **[SharedRep-RLHF: A Shared Representation Approach to RLHF with Diverse Preferences](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03672v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Uniform-reward reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), which trains a single reward model to represent the preferences of all annotators, fails to capture the diversity of opinions across sub-populations, inadvertently favoring dominant groups. The state-of-the-art, MaxMin-RLHF, addresses this by learning group-specific reward models, and by optimizing for the group receiving the minimum reward, thereby promoting fairness. However, we identify that a key limitation of MaxMin-RLHF is its poor performance when the minimum-reward group is a minority. To mitigate this drawback, we introduce a novel framework, termed {\em SharedRep-RLHF}. At its core, SharedRep-RLHF learns and leverages {\em shared traits} in annotations among various groups, in contrast to learning separate reward models across groups. We first show that MaxMin-RLHF is provably suboptimal in learning shared traits, and then quantify the sample complexity of SharedRep-RLHF. Experiments across diverse natural language tasks showcase the effectiveness of SharedRep-RLHF compared to MaxMin-RLHF with a gain of up to 20% in win rate.</p></details> |  |
| **[Balanced Actor Initialization: Stable RLHF Training of Distillation-Based Reasoning Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00309v1)** | 2025-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of alignment and reasoning capabilities in large language models has seen remarkable progress through two paradigms: instruction tuning and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) alignment paradigm, and distillation-based reasoning fine-tuning paradigm. While both approaches prove effective independently, the third paradigm of applying RLHF to distillation-trained models presents significant challenges. Our investigation reveals two critical phenomena that emerge in this paradigm: Sequence Length Collapse, where language generation dramatically reduces during early RLHF training, and the Reward Hockey Stick Curve, featuring severe reward score drops followed by gradual recovery. These instabilities fundamentally compromise the model's alignment and reasoning capabilities. To address these challenges, we propose Balanced Actor Initialization (BAI), a two-stage weighted model merging approach. BAI first merges instruction-following and distillation-based reasoning fine-tuned models, then further combines this intermediate model with the pretrained model to preserve foundational knowledge. Through comprehensive experiments across diverse benchmarks and detailed analysis of training experiments, we demonstrate that BAI resolves Sequence Length Collapse, mitigates the Reward Hockey Stick Curve, and enables continuous sequence length improvement during training. Additionally, our analysis reveals that balanced merging ratios achieve optimal trade-offs between training stability and reasoning capability preservation. Our work provides the effective solution for stable training in this third paradigm, enabling more capable reasoning models that combine distillation efficiency with RLHF alignment.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Algorithmic Bias of Aligning Large Language Models with RLHF: Preference Collapse and Matching Regularization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16455v2)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences is crucial for informing fair, economically sound, and statistically efficient decision-making processes. However, we argue that the predominant approach for aligning LLMs with human preferences through a reward model -- reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) -- suffers from an inherent algorithmic bias due to its Kullback--Leibler-based regularization in optimization. In extreme cases, this bias could lead to a phenomenon we term preference collapse, where minority preferences are virtually disregarded. To mitigate this algorithmic bias, we introduce preference matching (PM) RLHF, a novel approach that provably aligns LLMs with the preference distribution of the reward model under the Bradley--Terry--Luce/Plackett--Luce model. Central to our approach is a PM regularizer that takes the form of the negative logarithm of the LLM's policy probability distribution over responses, which helps the LLM balance response diversification and reward maximization. Notably, we obtain this regularizer by solving an ordinary differential equation that is necessary for the PM property. For practical implementation, we introduce a conditional variant of PM RLHF that is tailored to natural language generation. Finally, we empirically validate the effectiveness of conditional PM RLHF through experiments on the OPT and Llama-family models, demonstrating a 29% to 41% improvement in alignment with human preferences, as measured by a certain metric, compared to standard RLHF.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the Journal of the American Statistical Association</p></details> |
| **[KL-Regularised Q-Learning: A Token-level Action-Value perspective on Online RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17000v1)** | 2025-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) is an established and effective policy gradient algorithm used for Language Model Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (LM-RLHF). PPO performs well empirically but has a heuristic motivation and handles the KL-divergence constraint used in LM-RLHF in an ad-hoc manner. In this paper, we develop a a new action-value RL method for the LM-RLHF setting, KL-regularised Q-Learning (KLQ). We then show that our method is equivalent to a version of PPO in a certain specific sense, despite its very different motivation. Finally, we benchmark KLQ on two key language generation tasks -- summarisation and single-turn dialogue. We demonstrate that KLQ performs on-par with PPO at optimising the LM-RLHF objective, and achieves a consistently higher win-rate against PPO on LLM-as-a-judge evaluations.</p></details> |  |
| **[RLHF Fine-Tuning of LLMs for Alignment with Implicit User Feedback in Conversational Recommenders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05289v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conversational recommender systems (CRS) based on Large Language Models (LLMs) need to constantly be aligned to the user preferences to provide satisfying and context-relevant item recommendations. The traditional supervised fine-tuning cannot capture the implicit feedback signal, e.g., dwell time, sentiment polarity, or engagement patterns. In this paper, we share a fine-tuning solution using human feedback reinforcement learning (RLHF) to maximize implied user feedback (IUF) in a multi-turn recommendation context. We specify a reward model $R_{\phi}$ learnt on weakly-labelled engagement information and maximize user-centric utility by optimizing the foundational LLM M_{\theta} through a proximal policy optimization (PPO) approach. The architecture models conversational state transitions $s_t \to a_t \to s_{t +1}$, where the action $a_t$ is associated with LLM-generated item suggestions only on condition of conversation history in the past. The evaluation across synthetic and real-world datasets (e.g.REDIAL, OpenDialKG) demonstrates that our RLHF-fine-tuned models can perform better in terms of top-$k$ recommendation accuracy, coherence, and user satisfaction compared to (arrow-zero-cmwrquca-teja-falset ensuite 2Round group-deca States penalty give up This paper shows that implicit signal alignment can be efficient in achieving scalable and user-adaptive design of CRS.</p></details> |  |
| **[REINFORCE++: An Efficient RLHF Algorithm with Robustness to Both Prompt and Reward Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03262v8)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) plays a crucial role in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values and preferences. While state-of-the-art applications like ChatGPT or GPT-4 commonly employ Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), the inclusion of a critic network introduces significant computational overhead. REINFORCE-based methods, such as REINFORCE Leave One-Out (RLOO), ReMax, and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), address this limitation by eliminating the critic network. However, these approaches face challenges in accurate advantage estimation. Specifically, they estimate advantages independently for responses to each prompt, which can lead to overfitting on simpler prompts and vulnerability to reward hacking and may be biased. To address these challenges, we introduce REINFORCE++, a novel approach that removes the critic model while using the global advantage normalization which is unbiased to improve the training stability. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that REINFORCE++ exhibits robust performance across various reward models without requiring prompt set truncation. Furthermore, it achieves superior generalization in both RLHF and long chain-of-thought (CoT) settings compared to existing REINFORCE-based methods. The implementation is available at https://github.com/OpenRLHF/OpenRLHF.</p></details> | add experiments |

While existing RLHF training systems have enabled significant progress, they often face challenges in scaling to multi-modal and diffusion workflows and adapting to dynamic workloads. In particular, current approaches may encounter limitations in controller scalability, flexible resource placement, and efficient orchestration when handling complex RLHF pipelines, especially in scenarios involving dynamic sampling or generative reward modeling. In this paper, we present \textbf{G-Core}, a simple, scalable, and balanced RLHF training framework designed to address these challenges. G-Core introduces a parallel controller programming model, enabling flexible and efficient orchestration of complex RLHF workflows without the bottlenecks of a single centralized controller. Furthermore, we propose a dynamic placement schema that adaptively partitions resources and schedules workloads, significantly reducing hardware idle time and improving utilization, even under highly variable training conditions. G-Core has successfully trained models that support WeChat product features serving a large-scale user base, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness in real-world scenarios. Our results show that G-Core advances the state of the art in RLHF training, providing a solid foundation for future research and deployment of large-scale, human-aligned models.</p></details> | <details><summary>I hav...</summary><p>I haven't received company approval yet, and I uploaded it by mistake</p></details> |
| **[Harnessing RLHF for Robust Unanswerability Recognition and Trustworthy Response Generation in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16951v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conversational Information Retrieval (CIR) systems, while offering intuitive access to information, face a significant challenge: reliably handling unanswerable questions to prevent the generation of misleading or hallucinated content. Traditional approaches often rely on external classifiers, which can introduce inconsistencies with the core generative Large Language Models (LLMs). This paper introduces Self-Aware LLM for Unanswerability (SALU), a novel approach that deeply integrates unanswerability detection directly within the LLM's generative process. SALU is trained using a multi-task learning framework for both standard Question Answering (QA) and explicit abstention generation for unanswerable queries. Crucially, it incorporates a confidence-score-guided reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) phase, which explicitly penalizes hallucinated responses and rewards appropriate abstentions, fostering intrinsic self-awareness of knowledge boundaries. Through extensive experiments on our custom-built C-IR_Answerability dataset, SALU consistently outperforms strong baselines, including hybrid LLM-classifier systems, in overall accuracy for correctly answering or abstaining from questions. Human evaluation further confirms SALU's superior reliability, achieving high scores in factuality, appropriate abstention, and, most importantly, a dramatic reduction in hallucination, demonstrating its ability to robustly "know when to say 'I don't know'."</p></details> |  |

We explore two approaches that leverage human gaze modeling to enhance RLHF: (1) gaze-aware reward models and (2) gaze-based distribution of sparse rewards at token level. Our experiments demonstate that gaze-informed RLHF achieves faster convergence while maintaining or slightly improving performance, thus, reducing computational costs during policy optimization. These results show that human gaze provides a valuable and underused signal for policy optimization, pointing to a promising direction for improving RLHF efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Provably Efficient Online RLHF with One-Pass Reward Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07193v2)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has shown remarkable success in aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences. Traditional RLHF approaches rely on a fixed dataset, which often suffers from limited coverage. To this end, online RLHF has emerged as a promising direction, enabling iterative data collection and model improvement. Despite its potential, this paradigm faces a key bottleneck: the requirement to continuously integrate new data into the historical dataset and re-optimize the model from scratch at each iteration, resulting in computational and storage costs that grow linearly with the number of iterations. In this work, we address this challenge by proposing a one-pass reward modeling method that does not require storing the historical data and can be computed in constant time. Specifically, we first formalize RLHF as a contextual preference bandit problem and design an online mirror descent algorithm with a tailored local norm to replace the standard maximum likelihood estimation for reward modeling. We then apply our method to various online RLHF settings, including passive data collection, active data collection, and deployment-time adaptation. We provide theoretical guarantees showing that our method improves both statistical and computational efficiency. Finally, we provide practical algorithms and conduct experiments using Llama-3-8B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct models on the Ultrafeedback-binarized and Mixture2 datasets, validating the effectiveness of our proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first two authors contributed equally</p></details> |
| **[Accelerating RLHF Training with Reward Variance Increase](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23247v2)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is an essential technique for ensuring that large language models (LLMs) are aligned with human values and preferences during the post-training phase. As an effective RLHF approach, group relative policy optimization (GRPO) has demonstrated success in many LLM-based applications. However, efficient GRPO-based RLHF training remains a challenge. Recent studies reveal that a higher reward variance of the initial policy model leads to faster RLHF training. Inspired by this finding, we propose a practical reward adjustment model to accelerate RLHF training by provably increasing the reward variance and preserving the relative preferences and reward expectation. Our reward adjustment method inherently poses a nonconvex optimization problem, which is NP-hard to solve in general. To overcome the computational challenges, we design a novel $O(n \log n)$ algorithm to find a global solution of the nonconvex reward adjustment model by explicitly characterizing the extreme points of the feasible set. As an important application, we naturally integrate this reward adjustment model into the GRPO algorithm, leading to a more efficient GRPO with reward variance increase (GRPOVI) algorithm for RLHF training. As an interesting byproduct, we provide an indirect explanation for the empirical effectiveness of GRPO with rule-based reward for RLHF training, as demonstrated in DeepSeek-R1. Experiment results demonstrate that the GRPOVI algorithm can significantly improve the RLHF training efficiency compared to the original GRPO algorithm.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reward Shaping to Mitigate Reward Hacking in RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18770v3)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is essential for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values. However, RLHF is susceptible to \emph{reward hacking}, where the agent exploits flaws in the reward function rather than learning the intended behavior, thus degrading alignment. Although reward shaping helps stabilize RLHF and partially mitigate reward hacking, a systematic investigation into shaping techniques and their underlying principles remains lacking. To bridge this gap, we present a comprehensive study of the prevalent reward shaping methods. Our analysis suggests two key design principles: (1) the RL reward should be bounded, and (2) the RL reward benefits from rapid initial growth followed by gradual convergence. Guided by these insights, we propose Preference As Reward (PAR), a novel approach that leverages the latent preferences embedded within the reward model as the signal for reinforcement learning. We evaluated PAR on two base models, Gemma2-2B, and Llama3-8B, using two datasets, Ultrafeedback-Binarized and HH-RLHF. Experimental results demonstrate PAR's superior performance over other reward shaping methods. On the AlpacaEval 2.0 benchmark, PAR achieves a win rate of at least 5 percentage points higher than competing approaches. Furthermore, PAR exhibits remarkable data efficiency, requiring only a single reference reward for optimal performance, and maintains robustness against reward hacking even after two full epochs of training. The code is available at https://github.com/PorUna-byte/PAR, and the Work done during the internship at StepFun by Jiayi Fu.</p></details> | 24 pages |
| **[Theoretical Tensions in RLHF: Reconciling Empirical Success with Inconsistencies in Social Choice Theory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12350v1)** | 2025-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite its empirical success, Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has been shown to violate almost all the fundamental axioms in social choice theory -- such as majority consistency, pairwise majority consistency, and Condorcet consistency. This raises a foundational question: why does RLHF perform so well in practice if it fails these seemingly essential properties? In this paper, we resolve this paradox by showing that under mild and empirically plausible assumptions on the preference profile, RLHF does satisfy pairwise majority and Condorcet consistency. These assumptions are frequently satisfied in real-world alignment tasks, offering a theoretical explanation for RLHF's strong practical performance. Furthermore, we show that a slight modification to the reward modeling objective can ensure pairwise majority or Condorcet consistency even under general preference profiles, thereby improving the alignment process. Finally, we go beyond classical axioms in economic and social choice theory and introduce new alignment criteria -- preference matching, preference equivalence, and group preference matching -- that better reflect the goal of learning distributions over responses. We show that while RLHF satisfies the first two properties, it fails to satisfy the third. We conclude by discussing how future alignment methods may be designed to satisfy all three.</p></details> |  |
| **[RLHS: Mitigating Misalignment in RLHF with Hindsight Simulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08617v3)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has shown promise in aligning generative AI, we present empirical evidence that it can also cause severe, systematic misalignment. We hypothesize that this stems from evaluator feedback depending on downstream outcome predictions (foresight) that can be influenced by the AI's output, inducing Goodhart's law dynamics. We present a theoretical analysis showing that conditioning evaluator feedback on downstream observations (hindsight) inhibits this effect by decoupling the alignment signal from potentially compromised predictions--crucially, the result holds even if the observed outcomes are sampled from the AI's own world model. Building on this insight, we introduce Reinforcement Learning from Hindsight Simulation (RLHS), which presents plausible simulated outcomes to evaluators before eliciting feedback. We validate RLHS across three consultancy settings--marketplace interactions, restaurant recommendations, and online course advising--using both online (PPO) and offline (DPO) fine-tuning methods, and show that it substantially improves alignment over RLHF in experiments and human evaluations. We perform post-hoc benchmark evaluations on TruthfulQA, HaluEval, and TrustLLM, finding that even after single-task fine-tuning, RLHF misalignment persists, whereas RLHS consistently outperforms baselines and demonstrates robust alignment generalization.

| **[Active Preference Optimization for Sample Efficient RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10500v3)** | 2025-06-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) aligned using Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) have shown remarkable generation abilities in numerous tasks. However, collecting high-quality human preferences creates costly bottlenecks in practical deployments, and hence, training data are often budgeted. In these scenarios, it is crucial to collect training data (e.g., contexts, a pair of generations for each context, and a preference indicating which generation is better) carefully, yet most of the existing methods sample contexts uniformly at random from a given collection. Given this, under the Bradley-Terry-Luce preference model and with a small budget of training data, we show that uniform sampling of contexts could lead to a policy (i.e., an aligned model) that suffers a constant sub-optimality gap from the optimal policy. This highlights the need for an adaptive context sampling strategy for effective alignment under a small sample budget. To address this, we reformulate RLHF within the contextual preference bandit framework, treating generations as actions, and give a nearly complete characterization of the sub-optimality gap in terms of both lower and upper bounds. First, when the action set is a $d$-dimensional hypercube and the number of samples is $T$, we show an $\Omega(d/\sqrt{T})$ lower bound. Next, we propose an algorithm, $\textit{Active Preference Optimization}$ ($\texttt{APO}$), that iteratively collects preferences for the most uncertain contexts. We show that the sub-optimality gap of the policy learned via $\texttt{APO}$ matches the lower bound up to a log factor and a non-linearity constant. Finally, we perform experiments on practical datasets to validate $\texttt{APO}$'s efficacy over existing methods, establishing it as a sample-efficient and cost-effective solution for LLM alignment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ECML-PKDD 2025.

| **[Policy Filtration for RLHF to Mitigate Noise in Reward Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06957v5)** | 2025-06-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While direct policy optimization methods exist, pioneering LLMs are fine-tuned with reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to generate better responses under the supervision of a reward model learned from preference data. One major challenge of RLHF is the inaccuracy of the intermediate reward model, especially in the tasks that requires complex reasoning for the reward model to score a response. We find that the reliability of the reward model varies across responses assigned with different rewards. This motivates us to filter the samples whose rewards may be unreliable to improve the signal-to-noise ratio during policy learning, resulting in Policy Filtration for Proximal Policy Optimization (PF-PPO). To choose a proper policy filtering strategy, we use the coefficient of determination (R2) between the rewards and actual scores on filtered samples as the metrics to help us find promising strategies since it measures how well the rewards filtered by PF-PPO indicate real performance. We provide extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of PF-PPO in code generation and math reasoning tasks. In code generation, PF-PPO achieves the state-of-the-art performance of 7-billion-parameter models on HumanEval (+7.9%), MBPP (+0.7%), and LeetCode Contest (+10.0%) which is a more challenging benchmark created by us. In math reasoning, PF-PPO yields performance increase using different reward models and benchmarks (Ape210K and CMATH).

Incorporating multiple reference models has the potential to address these limitations by broadening perspectives, reducing bias, and leveraging the strengths of diverse open-source LLMs. However, integrating multiple reference models into reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) frameworks poses significant theoretical challenges, where achieving exact solutions has remained an open problem. This paper presents the first \emph{exact solution} to the multiple reference model problem in reverse KL-regularized RLHF. We introduce a comprehensive theoretical framework that includes rigorous statistical analysis and provides sample complexity guarantees. Additionally, we extend our analysis to forward KL-regularized RLHF, offering new insights into sample complexity requirements in multiple reference scenarios. Our contributions lay the foundation for more advanced and adaptable LLM alignment techniques, enabling the effective use of multiple reference models. This work paves the way for developing alignment frameworks that are both theoretically sound and better suited to the challenges of modern AI ecosystems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exper...</summary><p>Experiments are added in new version</p></details> |

However, RLHF's feedback mechanism also opens new pathways for adversaries. This paper demonstrates the feasibility of hijacking T2I models by poisoning a small fraction of preference data with natural-appearing examples. Specifically, we propose BadReward, a stealthy clean-label poisoning attack targeting the reward model in multi-modal RLHF. BadReward operates by inducing feature collisions between visually contradicted preference data instances, thereby corrupting the reward model and indirectly compromising the T2I model's integrity. Unlike existing alignment poisoning techniques focused on single (text) modality, BadReward is independent of the preference annotation process, enhancing its stealth and practical threat. Extensive experiments on popular T2I models show that BadReward can consistently guide the generation towards improper outputs, such as biased or violent imagery, for targeted concepts. Our findings underscore the amplified threat landscape for RLHF in multi-modal systems, highlighting the urgent need for robust defenses. Disclaimer.

| **[The Energy Loss Phenomenon in RLHF: A New Perspective on Mitigating Reward Hacking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19358v3)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work identifies the Energy Loss Phenomenon in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and its connection to reward hacking. Specifically, energy loss in the final layer of a Large Language Model (LLM) gradually increases during the RL process, with an excessive increase in energy loss characterizing reward hacking. Beyond empirical analysis, we further provide a theoretical foundation by proving that, under mild conditions, the increased energy loss reduces the upper bound of contextual relevance in LLMs, which is a critical aspect of reward hacking as the reduced contextual relevance typically indicates overfitting to reward model-favored patterns in RL. To address this issue, we propose an Energy loss-aware PPO algorithm (EPPO) which penalizes the increase in energy loss in the LLM's final layer during reward calculation to prevent excessive energy loss, thereby mitigating reward hacking. We theoretically show that EPPO can be conceptually interpreted as an entropy-regularized RL algorithm, which provides deeper insights into its effectiveness. Extensive experiments across various LLMs and tasks demonstrate the commonality of the energy loss phenomenon, as well as the effectiveness of EPPO in mitigating reward hacking and improving RLHF performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper has been accepted by ICML 2025</p></details> |
| **[A Descriptive and Normative Theory of Human Beliefs in RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01692v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human preferences in RLHF are typically modeled as a function of the human's reward function or corresponding optimal state-action values. In this work, we propose that human beliefs about the capabilities of the agent being trained also play a key role in preference generation. We examine two questions related to this hypothesis, one descriptive and one normative, respectively: Do human labelers' beliefs about agent capabilities affect the preferences that they provide? And what is the ideal set of beliefs about an agent -- and resulting preferences -- for humans to have? We propose a new preference model that incorporates human beliefs and provide a normative theory that bounds the error on the final learned policy based on the \textit{mismatch} between the human's beliefs and an idealized set of beliefs. We then confirm via a human study that beliefs about agent capabilities do, in fact, significantly affect preferences and can be influenced through simple interventions. Additionally, we empirically show through synthetic experiments that it is often suboptimal for human preference labelers to assume agent optimality. Collectively, these results theoretically and empirically demonstrate how reducing the mismatch between human beliefs and agent capabilities can lead to more performant RLHF and point toward new best practices for RLHF practitioners.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we consider the online RLHF setting where the preference data is revealed during the learning process and study action value function approximation. We design a model-free posterior sampling algorithm for online RLHF inspired by Thompson sampling and provide its theoretical guarantee. Specifically, we adopt Bellman eluder (BE) dimension as the complexity measure of the function class and establish $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret bound for the proposed algorithm with other multiplicative factor depending on the horizon, BE dimension and the $log$-bracketing number of the function class. Further, in the analysis, we first establish the concentration-type inequality of the squared Bellman error bound based on the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) generalization bound, which plays the crucial rules in obtaining the eluder-type regret bound and may be of independent interest.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Reward Fairness in RLHF: From a Resource Allocation Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23349v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rewards serve as proxies for human preferences and play a crucial role in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). However, if these rewards are inherently imperfect, exhibiting various biases, they can adversely affect the alignment of large language models (LLMs). In this paper, we collectively define the various biases present in rewards as the problem of reward unfairness. We propose a bias-agnostic method to address the issue of reward fairness from a resource allocation perspective, without specifically designing for each type of bias, yet effectively mitigating them. Specifically, we model preference learning as a resource allocation problem, treating rewards as resources to be allocated while considering the trade-off between utility and fairness in their distribution. We propose two methods, Fairness Regularization and Fairness Coefficient, to achieve fairness in rewards. We apply our methods in both verification and reinforcement learning scenarios to obtain a fairness reward model and a policy model, respectively. Experiments conducted in these scenarios demonstrate that our approach aligns LLMs with human preferences in a more fair manner.</p></details> | Accepted to ACL 2025 |
| **[Reward Generalization in RLHF: A Topological Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10184v7)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing alignment methods share a common topology of information flow, where reward information is collected from humans, modeled with preference learning, and used to tune language models. However, this shared topology has not been systematically characterized, nor have its alternatives been thoroughly explored, leaving the problems of low data efficiency and unreliable generalization unaddressed. As a solution, we introduce a theory of reward generalization in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), focusing on the topology of information flow at both macro and micro levels. At the macro level, we portray the RLHF information flow as an autoencoding process over behavior distributions, formalizing the RLHF objective of distributional consistency between human preference and model behavior. At the micro level, we present induced Bayesian networks to model the impact of dataset topologies on reward generalization. Combining analysis on both levels, we propose reward modeling from tree-structured preference information. It is shown to reduce reward uncertainty by up to $\Theta(\log n/\log\log n)$ times compared to baselines, where $n$ is the dataset size. Validation on three NLP tasks shows that it achieves an average win rate of 65% against baselines, thus improving reward generalization for free via topology design, while reducing the amount of data requiring annotation.</p></details> | <details><summary>46 pa...</summary><p>46 pages, ACL 2025 (Findings)</p></details> |
| **[Learning a Pessimistic Reward Model in RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20556v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work proposes `PET', a novel pessimistic reward fine-tuning method, to learn a pessimistic reward model robust against reward hacking in offline reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Traditional reward modeling techniques in RLHF train an imperfect reward model, on which a KL regularization plays a pivotal role in mitigating reward hacking when optimizing a policy. Such an intuition-based method still suffers from reward hacking, and the policies with large KL divergence from the dataset distribution are excluded during learning. In contrast, we show that when optimizing a policy on a pessimistic reward model fine-tuned through PET, reward hacking can be prevented without relying on any regularization. We test our methods on the standard TL;DR summarization dataset. We find that one can learn a high-quality policy on our pessimistic reward without using any regularization. Such a policy has a high KL divergence from the dataset distribution while having high performance in practice. In summary, our work shows the feasibility of learning a pessimistic reward model against reward hacking. The agent can greedily search for the policy with a high pessimistic reward without suffering from reward hacking.</p></details> |  |
| **[SCAR: Shapley Credit Assignment for More Efficient RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20417v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is a widely used technique for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences, yet it often suffers from sparse reward signals, making effective credit assignment challenging. In typical setups, the reward model provides a single scalar score for an entire generated sequence, offering little insight into which token or span-level decisions were responsible for the outcome. To address this, we propose Shapley Credit Assignment Rewards (SCAR), a novel method that leverages Shapley values in cooperative game theory. SCAR distributes the total sequence-level reward among constituent tokens or text spans based on their principled marginal contributions. This creates dense reward signals, crucially, without necessitating the training of auxiliary critique models or recourse to fine-grained human annotations at intermediate generation stages. Unlike prior dense reward methods, SCAR offers a game-theoretic foundation for fair credit attribution. Theoretically, we demonstrate that SCAR preserves the original optimal policy, and empirically, across diverse tasks including sentiment control, text summarization, and instruction tuning, we show that SCAR converges significantly faster and achieves higher final reward scores compared to standard RLHF and attention-based dense reward baselines. Our findings suggest that SCAR provides a more effective and theoretically sound method for credit assignment in RLHF, leading to more efficient alignment of LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[KL-regularization Itself is Differentially Private in Bandits and RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18407v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differential Privacy (DP) provides a rigorous framework for privacy, ensuring the outputs of data-driven algorithms remain statistically indistinguishable across datasets that differ in a single entry. While guaranteeing DP generally requires explicitly injecting noise either to the algorithm itself or to its outputs, the intrinsic randomness of existing algorithms presents an opportunity to achieve DP ``for free''. In this work, we explore the role of regularization in achieving DP across three different decision-making problems: multi-armed bandits, linear contextual bandits, and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), in offline data settings. We show that adding KL-regularization to the learning objective (a common approach in optimization algorithms) makes the action sampled from the resulting stochastic policy itself differentially private. This offers a new route to privacy guarantees without additional noise injection, while also preserving the inherent advantage of regularization in enhancing performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[On The Global Convergence Of Online RLHF With Neural Parametrization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15610v2)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The importance of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values cannot be overstated. RLHF is a three-stage process that includes supervised fine-tuning (SFT), reward learning, and policy learning. Although there are several offline and online approaches to aligning LLMs, they often suffer from distribution shift issues. These issues arise from the inability to accurately capture the distributional interdependence between the reward learning and policy learning stages. Consequently, this has led to various approximated approaches, but the theoretical insights and motivations remain largely limited to tabular settings, which do not hold in practice. This gap between theoretical insights and practical implementations is critical. It is challenging to address this gap as it requires analyzing the performance of AI alignment algorithms in neural network-parameterized settings. Although bi-level formulations have shown promise in addressing distribution shift issues, they suffer from the hyper-gradient problem, and current approaches lack efficient algorithms to solve this. In this work, we tackle these challenges employing the bi-level formulation laid out in Kwon et al. (2024) along with the assumption \emph{Weak Gradient Domination} to demonstrate convergence in an RLHF setup, obtaining a sample complexity of $\epsilon^{-\frac{7}{2}}$ . Our key contributions are twofold: (i) We propose a bi-level formulation for AI alignment in parameterized settings and introduce a first-order approach to solve this problem. (ii) We analyze the theoretical convergence rates of the proposed algorithm and derive state-of-the-art bounds. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to establish convergence rate bounds and global optimality for the RLHF framework in neural network-parameterized settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>The u...</summary><p>The updated version of this paper is arXiv:2503.17644</p></details> |
| **[A Unified Theoretical Analysis of Private and Robust Offline Alignment: from RLHF to DPO](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15694v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we theoretically investigate the effects of noisy labels in offline alignment, with a focus on the interplay between privacy and robustness against adversarial corruption. Specifically, under linear modeling assumptions, we present a unified analysis covering both reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and direct preference optimization (DPO) under different privacy-corruption scenarios, such as Local differential privacy-then-Corruption (LTC), where human preference labels are privatized before being corrupted by an adversary, and Corruption-then-Local differential privacy (CTL), where labels are corrupted before privacy protection. Our analysis leverages a reduction framework that reduces the offline alignment problem under linear modeling assumptions to parameter estimation in logistic regression. This framework allows us to establish an interesting separation result between LTC and CTL, demonstrating that LTC presents a greater challenge than CTL in offline alignment, even under linear models. As important by-products, our findings also advance the state-of-the-art theoretical results in offline alignment under privacy-only or corruption-only scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[DPO Meets PPO: Reinforced Token Optimization for RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18922v4)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the classical Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) framework, Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is employed to learn from sparse, sentence-level rewards -- a challenging scenario in traditional deep reinforcement learning. Despite the great successes of PPO in the alignment of large language models, its open-source implementation is still largely sub-optimal. To address these issues, we introduce a framework that models RLHF problems as a Markov decision process (MDP), enabling the capture of fine-grained token-wise information. Under this framework, we introduce an algorithm Reinforced Token Optimization (\texttt{RTO}), which learns the token-wise reward function from preference data and performs policy optimization based on this learned token-wise reward signal. Theoretically, \texttt{RTO} is proven to have the capability of finding the near-optimal policy sample-efficiently. For its practical implementation, \texttt{RTO} innovatively integrates Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and PPO. DPO, originally derived from sparse sentence rewards, surprisingly provides us with a token-wise characterization of response quality, which is seamlessly incorporated into our subsequent PPO training stage. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \texttt{RTO} performs better than PPO and other direct preference learning algorithms. In particular, RTO outperforms PPO by 7.5 points on the AlpacaEval 2 benchmark and by 4.1 points on Arena-Hard. Our code and models are available at \href{https://github.com/zkshan2002/RTO}{https://github.com/zkshan2002/RTO}.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |
| **[Multi-Level Aware Preference Learning: Enhancing RLHF for Complex Multi-Instruction Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12845v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>RLHF has emerged as a predominant approach for aligning artificial intelligence systems with human preferences, demonstrating exceptional and measurable efficacy in instruction following tasks; however, it exhibits insufficient compliance capabilities when confronted with complex multi-instruction tasks. Conventional approaches rely heavily on human annotation or more sophisticated large language models, thereby introducing substantial resource expenditure or potential bias concerns. Meanwhile, alternative synthetic methods that augment standard preference datasets often compromise the model's semantic quality. Our research identifies a critical oversight in existing techniques, which predominantly focus on comparing responses while neglecting valuable latent signals embedded within prompt inputs, and which only focus on preference disparities at the intra-sample level, while neglecting to account for the inter-sample level preference differentials that exist among preference data. To leverage these previously neglected indicators, we propose a novel Multi-level Aware Preference Learning (MAPL) framework, capable of enhancing multi-instruction capabilities. Specifically, for any given response in original preference data pairs, we construct varied prompts with a preference relation under different conditions, in order to learn intra-sample level preference disparities. Furthermore, for any given original preference pair, we synthesize multi-instruction preference pairs to capture preference discrepancies at the inter-sample level. Building on the two datasets constructed above, we consequently devise two sophisticated training objective functions. Subsequently, our framework integrates seamlessly into both Reward Modeling and Direct Preference Optimization paradigms. Through rigorous evaluation across multiple benchmarks, we empirically validate the efficacy of our framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bias Fitting to Mitigate Length Bias of Reward Model in RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12843v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback relies on reward models to align large language models with human preferences. However, RLHF often suffers from reward hacking, wherein policy learning exploits flaws in the trained reward model to maximize reward scores without genuinely aligning with human preferences. A significant example of such reward hacking is length bias, where reward models usually favor longer responses irrespective of actual response quality. Previous works on length bias have notable limitations, these approaches either mitigate bias without characterizing the bias form, or simply assume a linear length-reward relation. To accurately model the intricate nature of length bias and facilitate more effective bias mitigation, we propose FiMi-RM (Bias Fitting to Mitigate Length Bias of Reward Model in RLHF), a framework that autonomously learns and corrects underlying bias patterns. Our approach consists of three stages: First, we train a standard reward model which inherently contains length bias. Next, we deploy a lightweight fitting model to explicitly capture the non-linear relation between length and reward. Finally, we incorporate this learned relation into the reward model to debias. Experimental results demonstrate that FiMi-RM achieves a more balanced length-reward distribution. Furthermore, when applied to alignment algorithms, our debiased reward model improves length-controlled win rate and reduces verbosity without compromising its performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Due t...</summary><p>Due to the word limit for arXiv abstract, the abstract here has been abridged compared to the one in the PDF</p></details> |
| **[Can RLHF be More Efficient with Imperfect Reward Models? A Policy Coverage Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19255v3)** | 2025-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sample efficiency is critical for online Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). While existing works investigate sample-efficient online exploration strategies, the potential of utilizing misspecified yet relevant reward models to accelerate learning remains underexplored. This paper studies how to transfer knowledge from those imperfect reward models in online RLHF. We start by identifying a novel property due to KL-regularization in the RLHF objective: \emph{a policy's coverability of the optimal policy is captured by its sub-optimality}. Building on this insight, we propose novel transfer learning principles and a theoretical algorithm -- \emph{\textbf{T}ransfer \textbf{P}olicy \textbf{O}ptimization (\textbf{TPO})} -- with provable benefits compared to standard online learning. Empirically, inspired by our theoretical findings, we develop a win-rate-based transfer policy selection strategy with improved computational efficiency. Moreover, our empirical transfer learning technique is modular and can be integrated with various policy optimization methods, such as DPO, IPO and XPO, to further enhance their performance. We validate the effectiveness of our method through experiments on summarization tasks.</p></details> | 36 Pages; ICML 2025 |
| **[Online Bandit Learning with Offline Preference Data for Improved RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09574v4)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) is at the core of fine-tuning methods for generative AI models for language and images. Such feedback is often sought as rank or preference feedback from human raters, as opposed to eliciting scores since the latter tends to be noisy. On the other hand, RL theory and algorithms predominantly assume that a reward feedback is available. In particular, approaches for online learning that can be helpful in adaptive data collection via active learning cannot incorporate offline preference data. In this paper, we adopt a finite-armed linear bandit model as a prototypical model of online learning. We consider an offline preference dataset to be available generated by an expert of unknown 'competence'. We propose warmPref-PS, a posterior sampling algorithm for online learning that can be warm-started with an offline dataset with noisy preference feedback. We show that by modeling the 'competence' of the expert that generated it, we are able to use such a dataset most effectively. We support our claims with novel theoretical analysis of its Bayesian regret, as well as, extensive empirical evaluation of an approximate loss function that optimizes for infinitely many arms, and performs substantially better than baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Policy-labeled Preference Learning: Is Preference Enough for RLHF?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06273v2)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To design rewards that align with human goals, Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a prominent technique for learning reward functions from human preferences and optimizing policies via reinforcement learning algorithms. However, existing RLHF methods often misinterpret trajectories as being generated by an optimal policy, causing inaccurate likelihood estimation and suboptimal learning. Inspired by Direct Preference Optimization framework which directly learns optimal policy without explicit reward, we propose policy-labeled preference learning (PPL), to resolve likelihood mismatch issues by modeling human preferences with regret, which reflects behavior policy information. We also provide a contrastive KL regularization, derived from regret-based principles, to enhance RLHF in sequential decision making. Experiments in high-dimensional continuous control tasks demonstrate PPL's significant improvements in offline RLHF performance and its effectiveness in online settings.</p></details> |  |

While performant, this paradigm is computationally inefficient. Inspired by classical deep RL literature, we propose separating generation and learning in RLHF. This enables asynchronous generation of new samples while simultaneously training on old samples, leading to faster training and more compute-optimal scaling. However, asynchronous training relies on an underexplored regime, online but off-policy RLHF: learning on samples from previous iterations of our model which give a worse training signal. We tackle the fundamental challenge in this regime: how much off-policyness can we tolerate for asynchronous training to speed up learning but maintain performance? Among several RLHF algorithms we test, online DPO is found to be most robust to off-policy data, and robustness increases with the scale of the policy model. We study further compute optimizations for asynchronous RLHF but find that they come at a performance cost, giving rise to a trade-off. We verify the scalability of asynchronous RLHF by training a general-purpose chatbot from LLaMA 3.1 8B on an instruction-following task ~40% faster than a synchronous run while matching final performance. Finally, we extend our results to math and reasoning to demonstrate asynchronous RL can finetune Rho 1B on GSM8k ~70% faster while matching synchronous accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted at ICLR 2025, code at https://github.com/mnoukhov/async_rlhf, integrated into the open-instruct library https://github.com/allenai/open-instruct</p></details> |
| **[ReaL: Efficient RLHF Training of Large Language Models with Parameter Reallocation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14088v2)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is a pivotal technique for empowering large language model (LLM) applications. Compared with the supervised training process of LLMs, the RLHF training process is much more sophisticated, requiring a diverse range of computation workloads with intricate dependencies between multiple LLM instances. Therefore, simply adopting the fixed parallelization strategies from supervised training for LLMs can be insufficient for RLHF and result in low training efficiency. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel technique named parameter ReaLlocation, which dynamically adapts the parallelization strategies for different workloads during training by redistributing LLM parameters across the training cluster. Building upon this idea, we introduce ReaL, a pioneering system for efficient RLHF training. ReaL introduces the concept of an execution plan, which defines a fine-grained resource allocation and parallelization strategy particularly designed for RLHF training. Based on this concept, ReaL employs a tailored search algorithm with a lightweight run-time estimator to automatically discover an efficient execution plan for an instance of RLHF experiment. Subsequently, the runtime engine deploys the selected plan by effectively parallelizing computations and redistributing parameters. We evaluate ReaL on the LLaMA models with up to 70 billion parameters and 128 GPUs. The experimental results demonstrate that ReaL achieves speedups of up to $3.58\times$ compared to baseline methods. Furthermore, the execution plans generated by ReaL exhibit an average of $81\%$ performance improvement over heuristic approaches based on Megatron-LM in the long-context scenario. The source code of ReaL is publicly available at https://github.com/openpsi-project/ReaLHF .</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages (20 pages with references and the appendix), 17 figures.

| **[Regressing the Relative Future: Efficient Policy Optimization for Multi-turn RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04612v2)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success at tasks like summarization that involve a single turn of interaction. However, they can still struggle with multi-turn tasks like dialogue that require long-term planning. Previous works on multi-turn dialogue extend single-turn reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) methods to the multi-turn setting by treating all prior dialogue turns as a long context. Such approaches suffer from covariate shift: the conversations in the training set have previous turns generated by some reference policy, which means that low training error may not necessarily correspond to good performance when the learner is actually in the conversation loop. In response, we introduce REgressing the RELative FUture (REFUEL), an efficient policy optimization approach designed to address multi-turn RLHF in LLMs. REFUEL employs a single model to estimate $Q$-values and trains on self-generated data, addressing the covariate shift issue. REFUEL frames the multi-turn RLHF problem as a sequence of regression tasks on iteratively collected datasets, enabling ease of implementation. Theoretically, we prove that REFUEL can match the performance of any policy covered by the training set. Empirically, we evaluate our algorithm by using Llama-3.1-70B-it to simulate a user in conversation with our model. REFUEL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods such as DPO and REBEL across various settings. Furthermore, despite having only 8 billion parameters, Llama-3-8B-it fine-tuned with REFUEL outperforms Llama-3.1-70B-it on long multi-turn dialogues. Implementation of REFUEL can be found at https://github.com/ZhaolinGao/REFUEL/, and models trained by REFUEL can be found at https://huggingface.co/Cornell-AGI.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimizing RLHF Training for Large Language Models with Stage Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13221v3)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present RLHFuse, an efficient training system with stage fusion for Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). Due to the intrinsic nature of RLHF training, i.e., the data skewness in the generation stage and the pipeline bubbles in the training stage, existing RLHF systems suffer from low GPU utilization. RLHFuse breaks the traditional view of RLHF workflow as a composition of individual tasks, splitting each task into finer-grained subtasks, and performing stage fusion to improve GPU utilization. RLHFuse contains two key ideas. First, for generation and inference tasks, RLHFuse splits them into sample-level subtasks, enabling efficient inter-stage fusion to overlap the execution of generation and inference stages, thus mitigating the original generation bottleneck dominated by long-tailed samples. Second, for training tasks, RLHFuse breaks them into subtasks of micro-batches and performs intra-stage fusion to concurrently execute these subtasks in the training stage with a fused pipeline schedule, effectively mitigating the pipeline bubbles. The experiments show that RLHFuse increases the training throughput by up to $3.7\times$, compared to existing systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Federated RLHF with Aggregated Client Preference for LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03038v3)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) fine-tunes a pretrained large language model (LLM) using user preference data, enabling it to generate content aligned with human preferences. However, due to privacy concerns, users may be reluctant to share sensitive preference data. To address this, we propose utilizing Federated Learning (FL) techniques, allowing large-scale preference collection from diverse real-world users without requiring them to transmit data to a central server. Our federated RLHF methods (i.e., FedBis and FedBiscuit) encode each client's preferences into binary selectors and aggregate them to capture common preferences. In particular, FedBiscuit overcomes key challenges, such as preference heterogeneity and reward hacking, through innovative solutions like grouping clients with similar preferences to reduce heterogeneity and using multiple binary selectors to enhance LLM output quality. To evaluate the performance of the proposed methods, we establish the first federated RLHF benchmark with a heterogeneous human preference dataset. Experimental results show that by integrating the LLM with aggregated client preferences, FedBis and FedBiscuit significantly enhance the professionalism and readability of the generated content.</p></details> | ICLR'25 |
| **[Information-Theoretic Reward Decomposition for Generalizable RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06020v1)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A generalizable reward model is crucial in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) as it enables correctly evaluating unseen prompt-response pairs. However, existing reward models lack this ability, as they are typically trained by increasing the reward gap between chosen and rejected responses, while overlooking the prompts that the responses are conditioned on. Consequently, when the trained reward model is evaluated on prompt-response pairs that lie outside the data distribution, neglecting the effect of prompts may result in poor generalization of the reward model. To address this issue, we decompose the reward value into two independent components: prompt-free reward and prompt-related reward. Prompt-free reward represents the evaluation that is determined only by responses, while the prompt-related reward reflects the reward that derives from both the prompt and the response. We extract these two components from an information-theoretic perspective, which requires no extra models. Subsequently, we propose a new reward learning algorithm by prioritizing data samples based on their prompt-free reward values. Through toy examples, we demonstrate that the extracted prompt-free and prompt-related rewards effectively characterize two parts of the reward model. Further, standard evaluations show that our method improves both the alignment performance and the generalization capability of the reward model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Work ...</summary><p>Work done during internships at Institute of Artificial Intelligence (TeleAI), China Telecom</p></details> |
| **[A Unified Pairwise Framework for RLHF: Bridging Generative Reward Modeling and Policy Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04950v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a important paradigm for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences during post-training. This framework typically involves two stages: first, training a reward model on human preference data, followed by optimizing the language model using reinforcement learning algorithms. However, current RLHF approaches may constrained by two limitations. First, existing RLHF frameworks often rely on Bradley-Terry models to assign scalar rewards based on pairwise comparisons of individual responses. However, this approach imposes significant challenges on reward model (RM), as the inherent variability in prompt-response pairs across different contexts demands robust calibration capabilities from the RM. Second, reward models are typically initialized from generative foundation models, such as pre-trained or supervised fine-tuned models, despite the fact that reward models perform discriminative tasks, creating a mismatch. This paper introduces Pairwise-RL, a RLHF framework that addresses these challenges through a combination of generative reward modeling and a pairwise proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm. Pairwise-RL unifies reward model training and its application during reinforcement learning within a consistent pairwise paradigm, leveraging generative modeling techniques to enhance reward model performance and score calibration.

To solve this problem, alignment techniques such as RLHF, DPO and KTO are proposed. However, these alignment techniques have limitations. For example, RLHF requires training the reward model and policy separately, which is complex, time-consuming, memory intensive and unstable during training processes. DPO proposes a mapping between an optimal policy and a reward, greatly simplifying the training process of RLHF. However, it can not take full advantages of a reward model and it is limited to pairwise preference data. In this paper, we propose \textbf{UN}ified \textbf{A}lignment (UNA) which unifies RLHF/PPO, DPO and KTO. Firstly, we mathematically prove that given the classical RLHF objective, the optimal policy is induced by a generalize implicit reward function. With this novel mapping between a reward model and an optimal policy, UNA can 1. unify RLHF/PPO, DPO and KTO into a supervised learning of minimizing the difference between an implicit reward and an explicit reward; 2. outperform RLHF/PPO while simplify, stabilize, speed up and reduce memory burden of RL fine-tuning process; 3. accommodate different feedback types including pairwise, binary and scalar feedback. Downstream experiments show UNA outperforms DPO, KTO and RLHF.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sharpe Ratio-Guided Active Learning for Preference Optimization in RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22137v1)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has become a cornerstone of the training and alignment pipeline for large language models (LLMs). Recent advances, such as direct preference optimization (DPO), have simplified the preference learning step. However, collecting preference data remains a challenging and costly process, often requiring expert annotation. This cost can be mitigated by carefully selecting the data points presented for annotation. In this work, we propose an active learning approach to efficiently select prompt and preference pairs using a risk assessment strategy based on the Sharpe Ratio. To address the challenge of unknown preferences prior to annotation, our method evaluates the gradients of all potential preference annotations to assess their impact on model updates. These gradient-based evaluations enable risk assessment of data points regardless of the annotation outcome. By leveraging the DPO loss derivations, we derive a closed-form expression for computing these Sharpe ratios on a per-tuple basis, ensuring our approach remains both tractable and computationally efficient. We also introduce two variants of our method, each making different assumptions about prior information. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the baseline by up to 5% in win rates against the chosen completion with limited human preference data across several language models and real-world datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[One Framework to Rule Them All: Unifying RL-Based and RL-Free Methods in RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19523v2)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this article, we primarily examine a variety of RL-based and RL-free methods designed to address Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Large Reasoning Models (LRMs). We begin with a concise overview of the typical steps involved in RLHF and LRMs. Next, we reinterpret several RL-based and RL-free algorithms through the perspective of neural structured bandit prediction, providing a clear conceptual framework that uncovers a deeper connection between these seemingly distinct approaches. Following this, we briefly review some core principles of reinforcement learning, drawing attention to an often-overlooked aspect in existing RLHF studies. This leads to a detailed derivation of the standard RLHF objective within a full RL context, demonstrating its equivalence to neural structured bandit prediction. Finally, by reinvestigating the principles behind Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), we pinpoint areas needing adjustment, which culminates in the introduction of the Generalized Reinforce Optimization (GRO) framework, seamlessly integrating RL-based and RL-free methods in RLHF. We look forward to the community's efforts to empirically validate GRO and invite constructive feedback.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Shared Low-Rank Adaptation Approach to Personalized RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19201v1)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a pivotal technique for aligning artificial intelligence systems with human values, achieving remarkable success in fine-tuning large language models. However, existing RLHF frameworks often assume that human preferences are relatively homogeneous and can be captured by a single, unified reward model. This assumption overlooks the inherent diversity and heterogeneity across individuals, limiting the adaptability of RLHF to personalized scenarios and risking misalignments that can diminish user satisfaction and trust in AI systems. In this paper, we address these challenges by introducing Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) into the personalized RLHF framework. We apply LoRA in the the aggregated parameter space of all personalized reward functions, thereby enabling efficient learning of personalized reward models from potentially limited local datasets. Our approach exploits potential shared structures among the local ground-truth reward models while allowing for individual adaptation, without relying on restrictive assumptions about shared representations as in prior works. We further establish sample complexity guarantees for our method. Theoretical analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach in capturing both shared and individual-specific structures within heterogeneous human preferences, addressing the dual challenge of personalization requirements and practical data constraints. Experimental results on real-world datasets corroborate the efficiency of our algorithm in the personalized RLHF setting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at AISTATS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Mitigating Reward Over-Optimization in RLHF via Behavior-Supported Regularization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18130v1)** | 2025-03-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is an effective method for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values. However, reward over-optimization remains an open challenge leading to discrepancies between the performance of LLMs under the reward model and the true human objectives. A primary contributor to reward over-optimization is the extrapolation error that arises when the reward model evaluates out-of-distribution (OOD) responses. However, current methods still fail to prevent the increasing frequency of OOD response generation during the reinforcement learning (RL) process and are not effective at handling extrapolation errors from OOD responses. In this work, we propose the Behavior-Supported Policy Optimization (BSPO) method to mitigate the reward over-optimization issue. Specifically, we define behavior policy as the next token distribution of the reward training dataset to model the in-distribution (ID) region of the reward model. Building on this, we introduce the behavior-supported Bellman operator to regularize the value function, penalizing all OOD values without impacting the ID ones. Consequently, BSPO reduces the generation of OOD responses during the RL process, thereby avoiding overestimation caused by the reward model's extrapolation errors. Theoretically, we prove that BSPO guarantees a monotonic improvement of the supported policy until convergence to the optimal behavior-supported policy. Empirical results from extensive experiments show that BSPO outperforms baselines in preventing reward over-optimization due to OOD evaluation and finding the optimal ID policy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Understanding the Effects of RLHF on the Quality and Detectability of LLM-Generated Texts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17965v1)** | 2025-03-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance on a range of downstream NLP tasks by generating text that closely resembles human writing. However, the ease of achieving this similarity raises concerns from potential malicious uses at scale by bad actors, as LLM-generated text becomes increasingly difficult to discern from human text. Although detection methods have been developed to address this issue, bad actors can further manipulate LLM-generated texts to make them less detectable. In this work, we study how further editing texts with Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), which aligns model outputs with human preferences, affects (a) the quality of generated texts for two tasks, and (b) the performance of LLM-generated text detectors, looking at both training-based and zero-shot detection methods. Although RLHF improves the quality of LLM-generated texts, we find that it also tends to produce more detectable, lengthy, and repetitive outputs. Additionally, we observe that training-based detectors are vulnerable to short texts and to texts that incorporate code, whereas zero-shot detectors exhibit greater robustness.</p></details> | 14 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Aligning to What? Limits to RLHF Based Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09025v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is increasingly used to align large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. However, the effectiveness of RLHF in addressing underlying biases remains unclear. This study investigates the relationship between RLHF and both covert and overt biases in LLMs, particularly focusing on biases against African Americans. We applied various RLHF techniques (DPO, ORPO, and RLOO) to Llama 3 8B and evaluated the covert and overt biases of the resulting models using matched-guise probing and explicit bias testing. We performed additional tests with DPO on different base models and datasets; among several implications, we found that SFT before RLHF calcifies model biases. Additionally, we extend the tools for measuring biases to multi-modal models. Through our experiments we collect evidence that indicates that current alignment techniques are inadequate for nebulous tasks such as mitigating covert biases, highlighting the need for capable datasets, data curating techniques, or alignment tools.</p></details> |  |
| **[ROCM: RLHF on consistency models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06171v1)** | 2025-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have revolutionized generative modeling in continuous domains like image, audio, and video synthesis. However, their iterative sampling process leads to slow generation and inefficient training, challenges that are further exacerbated when incorporating Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) due to sparse rewards and long time horizons. Consistency models address these issues by enabling single-step or efficient multi-step generation, significantly reducing computational costs. In this work, we propose a direct reward optimization framework for applying RLHF to consistency models, incorporating distributional regularization to enhance training stability and prevent reward hacking. We investigate various $f$-divergences as regularization strategies, striking a balance between reward maximization and model consistency. Unlike policy gradient methods, our approach leverages first-order gradients, making it more efficient and less sensitive to hyperparameter tuning. Empirical results show that our method achieves competitive or superior performance compared to policy gradient based RLHF methods, across various automatic metrics and human evaluation. Additionally, our analysis demonstrates the impact of different regularization techniques in improving model generalization and preventing overfitting.</p></details> |  |
| **[On a Connection Between Imitation Learning and RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05079v1)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work studies the alignment of large language models with preference data from an imitation learning perspective. We establish a close theoretical connection between reinforcement learning from human feedback RLHF and imitation learning (IL), revealing that RLHF implicitly performs imitation learning on the preference data distribution. Building on this connection, we propose DIL, a principled framework that directly optimizes the imitation learning objective. DIL provides a unified imitation learning perspective on alignment, encompassing existing alignment algorithms as special cases while naturally introducing new variants. By bridging IL and RLHF, DIL offers new insights into alignment with RLHF. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DIL outperforms existing methods on various challenging benchmarks.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |
| **[LLM Misalignment via Adversarial RLHF Platforms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03039v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning has shown remarkable performance in aligning language models with human preferences, leading to the rise of attention towards developing RLHF platforms. These platforms enable users to fine-tune models without requiring any expertise in developing complex machine learning algorithms. While these platforms offer useful features such as reward modeling and RLHF fine-tuning, their security and reliability remain largely unexplored. Given the growing adoption of RLHF and open-source RLHF frameworks, we investigate the trustworthiness of these systems and their potential impact on behavior of LLMs. In this paper, we present an attack targeting publicly available RLHF tools. In our proposed attack, an adversarial RLHF platform corrupts the LLM alignment process by selectively manipulating data samples in the preference dataset. In this scenario, when a user's task aligns with the attacker's objective, the platform manipulates a subset of the preference dataset that contains samples related to the attacker's target. This manipulation results in a corrupted reward model, which ultimately leads to the misalignment of the language model. Our results demonstrate that such an attack can effectively steer LLMs toward undesirable behaviors within the targeted domains. Our work highlights the critical need to explore the vulnerabilities of RLHF platforms and their potential to cause misalignment in LLMs during the RLHF fine-tuning process.</p></details> |  |
| **[Taming Overconfidence in LLMs: Reward Calibration in RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09724v2)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language model calibration refers to the alignment between the confidence of the model and the actual performance of its responses. While previous studies point out the overconfidence phenomenon in Large Language Models (LLMs) and show that LLMs trained with Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) are overconfident with a more sharpened output probability, in this study, we reveal that RLHF tends to lead models to express verbalized overconfidence in their own responses. We investigate the underlying cause of this overconfidence and demonstrate that reward models used for Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) exhibit inherent biases towards high-confidence scores regardless of the actual quality of responses. Building upon this insight, we propose two PPO variants: PPO-M: PPO with Calibrated Reward Modeling and PPO-C: PPO with Calibrated Reward Calculation. PPO-M integrates explicit confidence scores in reward model training, which calibrates reward models to better capture the alignment between response quality and verbalized confidence. PPO-C adjusts the reward score during PPO based on the difference between the current reward and the exponential average of past rewards. Both PPO-M and PPO-C can be seamlessly integrated into the current PPO pipeline and do not require additional golden labels. We evaluate our methods on both Llama3-8B and Mistral-7B across six diverse datasets including multiple-choice and open-ended generation. Experimental results demonstrate that both of our methods can reduce calibration error and maintain performance comparable to standard PPO. We further show that they could preserve model capabilities in open-ended conversational settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating Defences against Unsafe Feedback in RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12914v3)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While there has been progress towards aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human values and ensuring safe behaviour at inference time, safety guards can easily be removed when fine tuned on unsafe and harmful datasets. While this setting has been treated extensively, another popular training paradigm, learning from unsafe feedback with reinforcement learning, has previously been unexplored. This is concerning due to the widespread deployment of feedback collection systems. We address this gap by providing an analysis of learning settings where feedback is harmful, i.e. that unsafe samples are preferred over safe ones despite model developers goal to maintain safety. We find that safety-aligned LLMs easily explore unsafe action spaces via generating harmful text and optimize for reward that violates safety constraints indicating that current safety guards are not enough to prevent learning from unsafe feedback. In order to protect against this vulnerability, we adapt a number of both "implict" and "explicit" harmful fine-tuning defences to evaluate whether they are effective as learning constraints in an RLHF setting finding that no method is generally effective pointing to the need for more defence research. We end the paper with the observation that some defences work by performing "harmless reward hacking" for which we provide a theoretical explanation drawn from the theory of Constrained Markov Decision Processes and provide some direction for future defence development.</p></details> |  |
| **[Projection Optimization: A General Framework for Multi-Objective and Multi-Group RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15145v2)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) is a widely used fine-tuning approach that aligns machine learning model, particularly Language Model (LM) with human preferences. There are typically multiple objectives driving the preference, hence humans find it easier to express per-objective comparisons rather than a global preference between two choices. Multi-Objective RLHF (MORLHF) aims to use per-objective preference feedback and achieve Pareto optimality among these objectives by aggregating them into a single unified objective for optimization. However, nearly all prior works rely on linear aggregation, which rules out policies that favor specific objectives such as the worst one. The only existing approach using non-linear aggregation is computationally expensive due to its reward-based nature and the need for retraining whenever the aggregation parameters change. In this work, we address this limitation by transforming the non-linear aggregation maximization problem into a series of sub-problems. Each sub-problem involves only linear aggregation, making it computationally efficient to solve. We further extend our framework to handle multi-group scenarios, where each group has distinct weights for the objectives. Our method enables achieving consensus or maximizing the aggregated objective across all groups. Theoretically, we demonstrate that our algorithmic framework achieves sublinear regret and can be easily adapted to a reward-free algorithm. Empirically, leveraging our theoretical insights, we propose a nearly training-free algorithm once the optimal policies for individual objectives are obtained.</p></details> |  |
| **[Simplify RLHF as Reward-Weighted SFT: A Variational Method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11026v2)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is crucial for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human values. However, RLHF has been continuously challenged by its high complexity in implementation and computation consumption. Even with recent simplifications, such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Advantage Leftover Lunch (A-LoL), the problems of over-fitting and training instability remain hindering the alignment process from the expected optimal performance. To address the existing challenges, we propose a novel simplification of RLHF from the perspective of variational inference, called $\textbf{V}$ariational $\textbf{A}$lignment with $\textbf{R}$e-weighting ($\textbf{VAR}$). More specifically, by directly minimizing the distribution gap between the learning LLM policy and the optimal solution of RLHF, we transform the alignment objective into a reward-driven re-weighted supervised fine-tuning (SFT) form, which only requires minor adjustment on the SFT loss to obtain noticeable improvement on training stability and effectiveness. On comprehensive alignment and generation benchmarks, our VAR method has numerically achieved competitive performance in LLM alignment helpfulness and harmlessness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Value-Incentivized Preference Optimization: A Unified Approach to Online and Offline RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19320v4)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has demonstrated great promise in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preference. Depending on the availability of preference data, both online and offline RLHF are active areas of investigation. A key bottleneck is understanding how to incorporate uncertainty estimation in the reward function learned from the preference data for RLHF, regardless of how the preference data is collected. While the principles of optimism or pessimism under uncertainty are well-established in standard reinforcement learning (RL), a practically-implementable and theoretically-grounded form amenable to large language models is not yet available, as standard techniques for constructing confidence intervals become intractable under arbitrary policy parameterizations. In this paper, we introduce a unified approach to online and offline RLHF -- value-incentivized preference optimization (VPO) -- which regularizes the maximum-likelihood estimate of the reward function with the corresponding value function, modulated by a $\textit{sign}$ to indicate whether the optimism or pessimism is chosen. VPO also directly optimizes the policy with implicit reward modeling, and therefore shares a simpler RLHF pipeline similar to direct preference optimization. Theoretical guarantees of VPO are provided for both online and offline settings, matching the rates of their standard RL counterparts. Moreover, experiments on text summarization and dialog verify the practicality and effectiveness of VPO.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

It has been shown to enhance both generation quality and trustworthiness. While numerous works have focused on improving retrieval, generation, and evaluation, the role of reward models in reinforcement learning for optimizing RAG remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{RAG-Reward}, a framework designed to develop reward models to enable \textit{hallucination-free, comprehensive, reliable, and efficient RAG}. We define four key metrics to assess generation quality and develop an automated benchmarking pipeline to evaluate the outputs of multiple LLMs across a variety of RAG scenarios. Using \textbf{RAG-Reward}, we train reward models and apply {reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF)} to improve LLMs' effectiveness in RAG. Experimental results demonstrate that our reward model achieves state-of-the-art performance in automatic benchmarking and aligns closely with human evaluations. Furthermore, the improved generation quality of the trained policy model highlights the feasibility and efficiency of using RLHF to enhance RAG outputs.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Equilibrate RLHF: Towards Balancing Helpfulness-Safety Trade-off in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11555v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) based on human preferences, commonly achieved through reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), has been effective in improving their performance. However, maintaining LLM safety throughout the fine-tuning process remains a significant challenge, as resolving conflicts between safety and helpfulness can be non-trivial. Typically, the safety alignment of LLM is trained on data with safety-related categories. However, our experiments find that naively increasing the scale of safety training data usually leads the LLMs to an ``overly safe'' state rather than a ``truly safe'' state, boosting the refusal rate through extensive safety-aligned data without genuinely understanding the requirements for safe responses. Such an approach can inadvertently diminish the models' helpfulness. To understand the phenomenon, we first investigate the role of safety data by categorizing them into three different groups, and observe that each group behaves differently as training data scales up. To boost the balance between safety and helpfulness, we propose an Equilibrate RLHF framework including a Fine-grained Data-centric (FDC) approach that achieves better safety alignment even with fewer training data, and an Adaptive Message-wise Alignment (AMA) approach, which selectively highlight the key segments through a gradient masking strategy. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances the safety alignment of LLMs while balancing safety and helpfulness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sharp Analysis for KL-Regularized Contextual Bandits and RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04625v2)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reverse-Kullback-Leibler (KL) regularization has emerged to be a predominant technique used to enhance policy optimization in reinforcement learning (RL) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), which forces the learned policy to stay close to a reference policy. While the effectiveness and necessity of KL-regularization have been empirically demonstrated in various practical scenarios, current theoretical analysis of KL-regularized RLHF still obtains the same $\mathcal{O}(1 / \epsilon^2)$ sample complexity as problems without KL-regularization. To understand the fundamental distinction between policy learning objectives with KL-regularization and ones without KL-regularization, we are the first to theoretically demonstrate the power of KL-regularization by providing a sharp analysis for KL-regularized contextual bandits and RLHF, revealing an $\mathcal{O}(1 / \epsilon)$ sample complexity when $\epsilon$ is sufficiently small. We further explore the role of data coverage in contextual bandits and RLHF. While the coverage assumption is commonly employed in offline RLHF to link the samples from the reference policy to the optimal policy, often at the cost of a multiplicative dependence on the coverage coefficient, its impact on the sample complexity of online RLHF remains unclear. Previous theoretical analyses of online RLHF typically require explicit exploration and additional structural assumptions on the reward function class. In contrast, we show that with sufficient coverage from the reference policy, a simple two-stage mixed sampling strategy can achieve a sample complexity with only an additive dependence on the coverage coefficient. Our results provide a comprehensive understanding of the roles of KL-regularization and data coverage in RLHF, shedding light on the design of more efficient RLHF algorithms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Influencing Humans to Conform to Preference Models for RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06416v2)** | 2025-02-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Designing a reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) algorithm to approximate a human's unobservable reward function requires assuming, implicitly or explicitly, a model of human preferences. A preference model that poorly describes how humans generate preferences risks learning a poor approximation of the human's reward function. In this paper, we conduct three human studies to asses whether one can influence the expression of real human preferences to more closely conform to a desired preference model. Importantly, our approach does not seek to alter the human's unobserved reward function. Rather, we change how humans use this reward function to generate preferences, such that they better match whatever preference model is assumed by a particular RLHF algorithm. We introduce three interventions: showing humans the quantities that underlie a preference model, which is normally unobservable information derived from the reward function; training people to follow a specific preference model; and modifying the preference elicitation question. All intervention types show significant effects, providing practical tools to improve preference data quality and the resultant alignment of the learned reward functions. Overall we establish a novel research direction in model alignment: designing interfaces and training interventions to increase human conformance with the modeling assumptions of the algorithm that will learn from their input.</p></details> |  |

We introduce Federated Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (FedRLHF), a novel framework that decentralizes the RLHF process. FedRLHF enables collaborative policy learning across multiple clients without necessitating the sharing of raw data or human feedback, thereby ensuring robust privacy preservation. Leveraging federated reinforcement learning, each client integrates human feedback locally into their reward functions and updates their policies through personalized RLHF processes. We establish rigorous theoretical foundations for FedRLHF, providing convergence guarantees, and deriving sample complexity bounds that scale efficiently with the number of clients. Empirical evaluations on the MovieLens and IMDb datasets demonstrate that FedRLHF not only preserves user privacy but also achieves performance on par with centralized RLHF, while enhancing personalization across diverse client environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Updated for AAMAS 2025 camera-ready.

| **[Segmenting Text and Learning Their Rewards for Improved RLHF in Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02790v1)** | 2025-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has been widely adopted to align language models (LMs) with human preference. Prior RLHF works typically take a bandit formulation, which, though intuitive, ignores the sequential nature of LM generation and can suffer from the sparse reward issue. While recent works propose dense token-level RLHF, treating each token as an action may be oversubtle to proper reward assignment. In this paper, we seek to get the best of both by training and utilizing a segment-level reward model, which assigns a reward to each semantically complete text segment that spans over a short sequence of tokens. For reward learning, our method allows dynamic text segmentation and compatibility with standard sequence-preference datasets. For effective RL-based LM training against segment reward, we generalize the classical scalar bandit reward normalizers into location-aware normalizer functions and interpolate the segment reward for further densification. With these designs, our method performs competitively on three popular RLHF benchmarks for LM policy: AlpacaEval 2.0, Arena-Hard, and MT-Bench. Ablation studies are conducted to further demonstrate our method.</p></details> |  |

Automatic Analysis of Refusal Composition in IFT/RLHF Datasets and Refusal Behavior of Black-Box LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16974v1)** | 2024-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Refusals - instances where large language models (LLMs) decline or fail to fully execute user instructions - are crucial for both AI safety and AI capabilities and the reduction of hallucinations in particular. These behaviors are learned during post-training, especially in instruction fine-tuning (IFT) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). However, existing taxonomies and evaluation datasets for refusals are inadequate, often focusing solely on should-not-related (instead of cannot-related) categories, and lacking tools for auditing refusal content in black-box LLM outputs. We present a comprehensive framework for classifying LLM refusals: (a) a taxonomy of 16 refusal categories, (b) a human-annotated dataset of over 8,600 instances from publicly available IFT and RLHF datasets, (c) a synthetic dataset with 8,000 examples for each refusal category, and (d) classifiers trained for refusal classification. Our work enables precise auditing of refusal behaviors in black-box LLMs and automatic analyses of refusal patterns in large IFT and RLHF datasets. This facilitates the strategic adjustment of LLM refusals, contributing to the development of more safe and reliable LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024 Workshop SFLLM</p></details> |

On The Impact of Preference Alignment On Trustworthiness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18870v2)** | 2024-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The trustworthiness of Large Language Models (LLMs) refers to the extent to which their outputs are reliable, safe, and ethically aligned, and it has become a crucial consideration alongside their cognitive performance. In practice, Reinforcement Learning From Human Feedback (RLHF) has been widely used to align LLMs with labeled human preferences, but its assumed effect on model trustworthiness hasn't been rigorously evaluated. To bridge this knowledge gap, this study investigates how models aligned with general-purpose preference data perform across five trustworthiness verticals: toxicity, stereotypical bias, machine ethics, truthfulness, and privacy. Our results demonstrate that RLHF on human preferences doesn't automatically guarantee trustworthiness, and reverse effects are often observed. Furthermore, we propose to adapt efficient influence function based data attribution methods to the RLHF setting to better understand the influence of fine-tuning data on individual trustworthiness benchmarks, and show its feasibility by providing our estimated attribution scores. Together, our results underscore the need for more nuanced approaches for model alignment from both the data and framework perspectives, and we hope this research will guide the community towards developing language models that are increasingly capable without sacrificing trustworthiness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Solving the Inverse Alignment Problem for Efficient RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10529v1)** | 2024-12-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Collecting high-quality preference datasets for reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is resource-intensive and challenging. As a result, researchers often train reward models on extensive offline datasets which aggregate diverse generation sources and scoring/alignment policies. We hypothesize that this aggregation has an averaging effect on reward model scores, which limits signal and impairs the alignment process. Inspired by the field of inverse RL, we define the 'inverse alignment problem' in language model training, where our objective is to optimize the critic's reward for a fixed actor and a fixed offline preference dataset. We hypothesize that solving the inverse alignment problem will improve reward model quality by providing clearer feedback on the policy's current behavior. To that end, we investigate whether repeatedly fine-tuning a reward model on subsets of the offline preference dataset aligned with a periodically frozen policy during RLHF improves upon vanilla RLHF. Our empirical results demonstrate that this approach facilitates superior alignment and faster convergence compared to using an unaligned or out-of-distribution reward model relative to the LLM policy.</p></details> |  |

Exploring the Impacts From Data, Model, and Method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06000v1)** | 2024-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study explores the scaling properties of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) in Large Language Models (LLMs). Although RLHF is considered an important step in post-training of LLMs, its scaling potential is still largely unknown. We systematically analyze key components in the RLHF framework--model size, data composition, and inference budget--and their impacts on performance. Our findings show that increasing data diversity and volume improves reward model performance, helping process-supervision models scale better. For policy training, more response samples per prompt boost performance initially but quickly plateau. And larger reward models offer modest gains in policy training. In addition, larger policy models benefit less from RLHF with a fixed reward model. Overall, RLHF scales less efficiently than pretraining, with diminishing returns from additional computational resources. Based on these observations, we propose strategies to optimize RLHF performance within computational limits.</p></details> |  |
| **[Language Models Learn to Mislead Humans via RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12822v3)** | 2024-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language models (LMs) can produce errors that are hard to detect for humans, especially when the task is complex. RLHF, the most popular post-training method, may exacerbate this problem: to achieve higher rewards, LMs might get better at convincing humans that they are right even when they are wrong. We study this phenomenon under a standard RLHF pipeline, calling it "U-SOPHISTRY" since it is Unintended by model developers. Specifically, we ask time-constrained (e.g., 3-10 minutes) human subjects to evaluate the correctness of model outputs and calculate humans' accuracy against gold labels. On a question-answering task (QuALITY) and programming task (APPS), RLHF makes LMs better at convincing our subjects but not at completing the task correctly. RLHF also makes the model harder to evaluate: our subjects' false positive rate increases by 24.1% on QuALITY and 18.3% on APPS. Finally, we show that probing, a state-of-the-art approach for detecting Intended Sophistry (e.g. backdoored LMs), does not generalize to U-SOPHISTRY. Our results highlight an important failure mode of RLHF and call for more research in assisting humans to align them.</p></details> |  |
| **[Provably Mitigating Overoptimization in RLHF: Your SFT Loss is Implicitly an Adversarial Regularizer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16436v3)** | 2024-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aligning generative models with human preference via RLHF typically suffers from overoptimization, where an imperfectly learned reward model can misguide the generative model to output undesired responses. We investigate this problem in a principled manner by identifying the source of the misalignment as a form of distributional shift and uncertainty in learning human preferences. To mitigate overoptimization, we first propose a theoretical algorithm that chooses the best policy for an adversarially chosen reward model; one that simultaneously minimizes the maximum likelihood estimation of the loss and a reward penalty term. Here, the reward penalty term is introduced to prevent the policy from choosing actions with spurious high proxy rewards, resulting in provable sample efficiency of the algorithm under a partial coverage style condition. Moving from theory to practice, the proposed algorithm further enjoys an equivalent but surprisingly easy-to-implement reformulation. Using the equivalence between reward models and the corresponding optimal policy, the algorithm features a simple objective that combines: (i) a preference optimization loss that directly aligns the policy with human preference, and (ii) a supervised learning loss that explicitly imitates the policy with a (suitable) baseline distribution. In the context of aligning large language models (LLM), this objective fuses the direct preference optimization (DPO) loss with the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) loss to help mitigate the overoptimization towards undesired responses, for which we name the algorithm Regularized Preference Optimization (RPO). Experiments of aligning LLMs demonstrate the improved performance of RPO compared with DPO baselines. Our work sheds light on the interplay between preference optimization and SFT in tuning LLMs with both theoretical guarantees and empirical evidence.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by The Thirty-Eighth Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems. 31 pages, 7 figures</p></details> |
| **[Continual SFT Matches Multimodal RLHF with Negative Supervision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14797v1)** | 2024-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal RLHF usually happens after supervised finetuning (SFT) stage to continually improve vision-language models' (VLMs) comprehension. Conventional wisdom holds its superiority over continual SFT during this preference alignment stage. In this paper, we observe that the inherent value of multimodal RLHF lies in its negative supervision, the logit of the rejected responses. We thus propose a novel negative supervised finetuning (nSFT) approach that fully excavates these information resided. Our nSFT disentangles this negative supervision in RLHF paradigm, and continually aligns VLMs with a simple SFT loss. This is more memory efficient than multimodal RLHF where 2 (e.g., DPO) or 4 (e.g., PPO) large VLMs are strictly required. The effectiveness of nSFT is rigorously proved by comparing it with various multimodal RLHF approaches, across different dataset sources, base VLMs and evaluation metrics. Besides, fruitful of ablations are provided to support our hypothesis. We hope this paper will stimulate further research to properly align large vision language models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Value Imprint: A Technique for Auditing the Human Values Embedded in RLHF Datasets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11937v1)** | 2024-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs are increasingly fine-tuned using RLHF datasets to align them with human preferences and values. However, very limited research has investigated which specific human values are operationalized through these datasets. In this paper, we introduce Value Imprint, a framework for auditing and classifying the human values embedded within RLHF datasets. To investigate the viability of this framework, we conducted three case study experiments by auditing the Anthropic/hh-rlhf, OpenAI WebGPT Comparisons, and Alpaca GPT-4-LLM datasets to examine the human values embedded within them. Our analysis involved a two-phase process. During the first phase, we developed a taxonomy of human values through an integrated review of prior works from philosophy, axiology, and ethics. Then, we applied this taxonomy to annotate 6,501 RLHF preferences. During the second phase, we employed the labels generated from the annotation as ground truth data for training a transformer-based machine learning model to audit and classify the three RLHF datasets. Through this approach, we discovered that information-utility values, including Wisdom/Knowledge and Information Seeking, were the most dominant human values within all three RLHF datasets. In contrast, prosocial and democratic values, including Well-being, Justice, and Human/Animal Rights, were the least represented human values. These findings have significant implications for developing language models that align with societal values and norms. We contribute our datasets to support further research in this area.</p></details> |  |

However, existing open-source RLHF projects are still largely confined to the offline learning setting. In this technical report, we aim to fill in this gap and provide a detailed recipe that is easy to reproduce for online iterative RLHF. In particular, since online human feedback is usually infeasible for open-source communities with limited resources, we start by constructing preference models using a diverse set of open-source datasets and use the constructed proxy preference model to approximate human feedback. Then, we discuss the theoretical insights and algorithmic principles behind online iterative RLHF, followed by a detailed practical implementation. Our trained LLM achieves impressive performance on LLM chatbot benchmarks, including AlpacaEval-2, Arena-Hard, and MT-Bench, as well as other academic benchmarks such as HumanEval and TruthfulQA. We have shown that supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and iterative RLHF can obtain state-of-the-art performance with fully open-source datasets. Further, we have made our models, curated datasets, and comprehensive step-by-step code guidebooks publicly available.

| **[A Theoretical Framework for Partially Observed Reward-States in RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03282v3)** | 2024-11-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing deployment of reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) calls for a deeper theoretical investigation of its underlying models. The prevalent models of RLHF do not account for neuroscience-backed, partially-observed "internal states" that can affect human feedback, nor do they accommodate intermediate feedback during an interaction. Both of these can be instrumental in speeding up learning and improving alignment. To address these limitations, we model RLHF as reinforcement learning with partially observed reward-states (PORRL). We accommodate two kinds of feedback $-$ cardinal and dueling feedback. We first demonstrate that PORRL subsumes a wide class of RL problems, including traditional RL, RLHF, and reward machines. For cardinal feedback, we present two model-based methods (POR-UCRL, POR-UCBVI). We give both cardinal regret and sample complexity guarantees for the methods, showing that they improve over naive history-summarization. We then discuss the benefits of a model-free method like GOLF with naive history-summarization in settings with recursive internal states and dense intermediate feedback. For this purpose, we define a new history aware version of the Bellman-eluder dimension and give a new guarantee for GOLF in our setting, which can be exponentially sharper in illustrative examples. For dueling feedback, we show that a naive reduction to cardinal feedback fails to achieve sublinear dueling regret. We then present the first explicit reduction that converts guarantees for cardinal regret to dueling regret. In both feedback settings, we show that our models and guarantees generalize and extend existing ones.</p></details> | <details><summary>64 pa...</summary><p>64 pages. 14 pages for main paper, 50 pages for references + appendix</p></details> |
| **[Catastrophic Goodhart: regularizing RLHF with KL divergence does not mitigate heavy-tailed reward misspecification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14503v2)** | 2024-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When applying reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), the reward is learned from data and, therefore, always has some error. It is common to mitigate this by regularizing the policy with KL divergence from a base model, with the hope that balancing reward with regularization will achieve desirable outcomes despite this reward misspecification. We show that when the reward function has light-tailed error, optimal policies under less restrictive KL penalties achieve arbitrarily high utility. However, if error is heavy-tailed, some policies obtain arbitrarily high reward despite achieving no more utility than the base model--a phenomenon we call catastrophic Goodhart. We adapt a discrete optimization method to measure the tails of reward models, finding that they are consistent with light-tailed error. However, the pervasiveness of heavy-tailed distributions in many real-world applications indicates that future sources of RL reward could have heavy-tailed error, increasing the likelihood of reward hacking even with KL regularization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Mecha...</summary><p>Mechanistic Interpretability workshop at ICML 2024; Main conference poster at NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |
| **[SALSA: Soup-based Alignment Learning for Stronger Adaptation in RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01798v1)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In Large Language Model (LLM) development, Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is crucial for aligning models with human values and preferences. RLHF traditionally relies on the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the current policy and a frozen initial policy as a reference, which is added as a penalty in policy optimization algorithms like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). While this constraint prevents models from deviating too far from the initial checkpoint, it limits exploration of the reward landscape, reducing the model's ability to discover higher-quality solutions. As a result, policy optimization is often trapped in a narrow region of the parameter space, leading to suboptimal alignment and performance. This paper presents SALSA (Soup-based Alignment Learning for Stronger Adaptation), a novel approach designed to overcome these limitations by creating a more flexible and better located reference model through weight-space averaging of two independent supervised fine-tuned (SFT) models. This model soup allows for larger deviation in KL divergence and exploring a promising region of the solution space without sacrificing stability. By leveraging this more robust reference model, SALSA fosters better exploration, achieving higher rewards and improving model robustness, out-of-distribution generalization, and performance. We validate the effectiveness of SALSA through extensive experiments on popular open models (Llama2-7B, Mistral-7B, and Gemma-2B) across various benchmarks (MT-Bench, Arena-Hard, UltraFeedback), where it consistently surpasses PPO by fostering deeper exploration and achieving superior alignment in LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[InfoRM: Mitigating Reward Hacking in RLHF via Information-Theoretic Reward Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09345v5)** | 2024-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the success of reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) in aligning language models with human values, reward hacking, also termed reward overoptimization, remains a critical challenge. This issue primarily arises from reward misgeneralization, where reward models (RMs) compute reward using spurious features that are irrelevant to human preferences. In this work, we tackle this problem from an information-theoretic perspective and propose a framework for reward modeling, namely InfoRM, by introducing a variational information bottleneck objective to filter out irrelevant information. Notably, we further identify a correlation between overoptimization and outliers in the IB latent space of InfoRM, establishing it as a promising tool for detecting reward overoptimization. Inspired by this finding, we propose the Cluster Separation Index (CSI), which quantifies deviations in the IB latent space, as an indicator of reward overoptimization to facilitate the development of online mitigation strategies. Extensive experiments on a wide range of settings and RM scales (70M, 440M, 1.4B, and 7B) demonstrate the effectiveness of InfoRM. Further analyses reveal that InfoRM's overoptimization detection mechanism is not only effective but also robust across a broad range of datasets, signifying a notable advancement in the field of RLHF. The code will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper has been accepted by NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |
| **[Towards Reliable Alignment: Uncertainty-aware RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23726v1)** | 2024-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in aligning Large Language Models with human preferences have benefited from larger reward models and better preference data. However, most of these methodologies rely on the accuracy of the reward model. The reward models used in Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) are typically learned from small datasets using stochastic optimization algorithms, making them prone to high variability. We illustrate the inconsistencies between reward models empirically on numerous open-source datasets. We theoretically show that the fluctuation of the reward models can be detrimental to the alignment problem because the derived policies are more overfitted to the reward model and, hence, are riskier if the reward model itself is uncertain. We use concentration of measure to motivate an uncertainty-aware, conservative algorithm for policy optimization. We show that such policies are more risk-averse in the sense that they are more cautious of uncertain rewards. We theoretically prove that our proposed methodology has less risk than the vanilla method. We corroborate our theoretical results with experiments based on designing an ensemble of reward models. We use this ensemble of reward models to align a language model using our methodology and observe that our empirical findings match our theoretical predictions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reward Difference Optimization For Sample Reweighting In Offline RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09385v2)** | 2024-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), aligning LLMs with human preferences become increasingly important. Although Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) proves effective, it is complicated and highly resource-intensive. As such, offline RLHF has been introduced as an alternative solution, which directly optimizes LLMs with ranking losses on a fixed preference dataset. Current offline RLHF only captures the "ordinal relationship" between responses, overlooking the crucial aspect of how much one is preferred over the others. To address this issue, we propose a simple yet effective solution called Reward Difference Optimization, shorted as RDO. Specifically, we introduce reward difference coefficients to reweigh sample pairs in offline RLHF. We then develop a difference model which captures rich interactions between a pair of responses for predicting these difference coefficients. Experiments with 7B LLMs on the HH and TL;DR datasets substantiate the effectiveness of our method in both automatic metrics and human evaluation, thereby highlighting its potential for aligning LLMs with human intent and values</p></details> | EMNLP 2024 findings |
| **[Measuring memorization in RLHF for code completion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11715v2)** | 2024-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) has become the dominant method to align large models to user preferences. Unlike fine-tuning, for which there are many studies regarding training data memorization, it is not clear how memorization is affected by or introduced in the RLHF alignment process. Understanding this relationship is important as real user data may be collected and used to align large models; if user data is memorized during RLHF and later regurgitated, this could raise privacy concerns. In addition to RLHF, other methods such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and $\Psi$PO have gained popularity for learning directly from human preferences, removing the need for optimizing intermediary reward models with reinforcement learning. In this work, we analyze how training data memorization can surface and propagate through each phase of RLHF and direct preference learning. We focus our study on code completion models, as code completion is one of the most popular use cases for large language models. We find that RLHF significantly decreases the chance that data used for reward modeling and reinforcement learning is memorized in comparison to directly fine-tuning on this data, but that examples already memorized during the fine-tuning stage of RLHF, will, in the majority of cases, remain memorized after RLHF. In contrast, we find that aligning by learning directly from human preference data via a special case of $\Psi$PO, Identity Preference Optimization (IPO), increases the likelihood that training data is regurgitated compared to RLHF. Our work suggests that RLHF, as opposed to direct preference learning, is a safer way to mitigate the risk of regurgitating sensitive preference data when aligning large language models. We find our conclusions are robust across multiple code completion datasets, tasks, and model scales.</p></details> |  |

Among reasoning tasks, multi-step reasoning poses a particular challenge. Grounded in the theory of formal logic, we have developed an automated method, Multi-step Deduction (MuseD), for deductive reasoning data. MuseD has allowed us to create training and testing datasets for multi-step reasoning. Our generation method enables control over the complexity of the generated instructions, facilitating training and evaluation of models across different difficulty levels. Through RLHF training, our training data has demonstrated significant improvements in logical capabilities for both in-domain of out-of-domain reasoning tasks. Additionally, we have conducted tests to assess the multi-step reasoning abilities of various models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimal Design for Reward Modeling in RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17055v2)** | 2024-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has become a popular approach to align language models (LMs) with human preferences. This method involves collecting a large dataset of human pairwise preferences across various text generations and using it to infer (implicitly or explicitly) a reward model. Numerous methods have been proposed to learn the reward model and align a LM with it. However, the costly process of collecting human preferences has received little attention and could benefit from theoretical insights. This paper addresses this issue and aims to formalize the reward training model in RLHF. We frame the selection of an effective dataset as a simple regret minimization task, using a linear contextual dueling bandit method. Given the potentially large number of arms, this approach is more coherent than the best-arm identification setting. We then propose an offline framework for solving this problem. Under appropriate assumptions - linearity of the reward model in the embedding space, and boundedness of the reward parameter - we derive bounds on the simple regret. Finally, we provide a lower bound that matches our upper bound up to constant and logarithmic terms. To our knowledge, this is the first theoretical contribution in this area to provide an offline approach as well as worst-case guarantees.</p></details> |  |
| **[How to Evaluate Reward Models for RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14872v2)** | 2024-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a new benchmark for reward models that quantifies their ability to produce strong language models through RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback). The gold-standard approach is to run a full RLHF training pipeline and directly probe downstream LLM performance. However, this process is prohibitively expensive. To address this, we build a predictive model of downstream LLM performance by evaluating the reward model on proxy tasks. These proxy tasks consist of a large-scale human preference and a verifiable correctness preference dataset, in which we measure 12 metrics across 12 domains. To investigate which reward model metrics are most correlated to gold-standard RLHF outcomes, we launch an end-to-end RLHF experiment on a large-scale crowdsourced human preference platform to view real reward model downstream performance as ground truth. Ultimately, we compile our data and findings into Preference Proxy Evaluations (PPE), the first reward model benchmark explicitly linked to post-RLHF real-world human preference performance, which we open-source for public use and further development. Our code and evaluations can be found at https://github.com/lmarena/PPE .</p></details> |  |

This misalignment often results in noticeable distortions and artifacts that cause speech enhancement to be ineffective. To address these issues, we propose a reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) framework to fine-tune an existing speech enhancement approach by optimizing performance using a mean-opinion score (MOS)-based reward model. Our results show that the RLHF-finetuned model has the best performance across different benchmarks for both objective and MOS-based speech quality assessment metrics on the Voicebank+DEMAND dataset. Through ablation studies, we show that both policy gradient loss and supervised MSE loss are important for balanced optimization across the different metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICASSP 2025</p></details> |

Existing approaches, such as retrieval augmented generation (RAG) methods, search agents, and search equipped MLLMs, often suffer from rigid pipelines, excessive search calls, and poorly constructed search queries, which result in inefficiencies and suboptimal outcomes. To address these limitations, we present DeepMMSearch-R1, the first multimodal LLM capable of performing on-demand, multi-turn web searches and dynamically crafting queries for both image and text search tools. Specifically, DeepMMSearch-R1 can initiate web searches based on relevant crops of the input image making the image search more effective, and can iteratively adapt text search queries based on retrieved information, thereby enabling self-reflection and self-correction. Our approach relies on a two-stage training pipeline: a cold start supervised finetuning phase followed by an online reinforcement learning optimization. For training, we introduce DeepMMSearchVQA, a novel multimodal VQA dataset created through an automated pipeline intermixed with real-world information from web search tools. This dataset contains diverse, multi-hop queries that integrate textual and visual information, teaching the model when to search, what to search for, which search tool to use and how to reason over the retrieved information. We conduct extensive experiments across a range of knowledge-intensive benchmarks to demonstrate the superiority of our approach. Finally, we analyze the results and provide insights that are valuable for advancing multimodal web-search.</p></details> |  |

Adaptive-depth methods can improve efficiency, but prior approaches rely on costly inference-time search, architectural changes, or large-scale retraining, and in practice often degrade accuracy despite efficiency gains. We introduce Dr.LLM, Dynamic routing of Layers for LLMs, a retrofittable framework that equips pretrained models with lightweight per-layer routers deciding to skip, execute, or repeat a block. Routers are trained with explicit supervision: using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), we derive high-quality layer configurations that preserve or improve accuracy under a compute budget. Our design, windowed pooling for stable routing, focal loss with class balancing, and bottleneck MLP routers, ensures robustness under class imbalance and long sequences. On ARC (logic) and DART (math), Dr.LLM improves accuracy by up to +3.4%p while saving 5 layers per example on average. Routers generalize to out-of-domain tasks (MMLU, GSM8k, AIME, TruthfulQA, SQuADv2, GPQA, PIQA, AGIEval) with only 0.85% accuracy drop while retaining efficiency, and outperform prior routing methods by up to +7.7%p. Overall, Dr.LLM shows that explicitly supervised routers retrofit frozen LLMs for budget-aware, accuracy-driven inference without altering base weights.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, Under submission</p></details> |

The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) overcomes this historical barrier, allowing applications developers to instantly govern model behavior by editing prompt instructions. This shift enables a new paradigm: data-model co-evolution, where a living test set and a model's instructions evolve in tandem. We operationalize this paradigm in an interactive system designed to address the critical challenge of encoding subtle, domain-specific policies into prompt instructions. The system's structured workflow guides people to discover edge cases, articulate rationales for desired behavior, and iteratively evaluate instruction revisions against a growing test set. A user study shows our workflow helps participants refine instructions systematically and specify ambiguous policies more concretely. This work points toward more robust and responsible LLM applications through human-in-the-loop development aligned with local preferences and policies.</p></details> |  |
| **[CARVQ: Corrective Adaptor with Group Residual Vector Quantization for LLM Embedding Compression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12721v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) typically rely on a large number of parameters for token embedding, leading to substantial storage requirements and memory footprints. In particular, LLMs deployed on edge devices are memory-bound, and reducing the memory footprint by compressing the embedding layer not only frees up the memory bandwidth but also speeds up inference. To address this, we introduce CARVQ, a post-training novel Corrective Adaptor combined with group Residual Vector Quantization. CARVQ relies on the composition of both linear and non-linear maps and mimics the original model embedding to compress to approximately 1.6 bits without requiring specialized hardware to support lower-bit storage. We test our method on pre-trained LLMs such as LLaMA-3.2-1B, LLaMA-3.2-3B, LLaMA-3.2-3B-Instruct, LLaMA-3.1-8B, Qwen2.5-7B, Qwen2.5-Math-7B and Phi-4, evaluating on common generative, discriminative, math and reasoning tasks. We show that in most cases, CARVQ can achieve lower average bitwidth-per-parameter while maintaining reasonable perplexity and accuracy compared to scalar quantization. Our contributions include a novel compression technique that is compatible with state-of-the-art transformer quantization methods and can be seamlessly integrated into any hardware supporting 4-bit memory to reduce the model's memory footprint in memory-constrained devices. This work demonstrates a crucial step toward the efficient deployment of LLMs on edge devices.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP Findings 2025</p></details> |

However, current LLMs are often miscalibrated. They collapse to overly homogeneous outputs for creative tasks and hallucinate diverse but incorrect responses for factual tasks. We argue that these two failure modes are unified by, and can both be addressed by, the notion of effective generation space size (GSS) -- the set of semantically distinct outputs a model considers for a prompt. We present GSSBench, a task suite of prompt pairs with ground-truth GSS relationships to assess different metrics and understand where models diverge from desired behavior. We find that hallucination detection metrics, particularly EigenScore, consistently outperform standard diversity and uncertainty quantification metrics, while using only model internals, providing interpretable insights into a model's internal task representations. We demonstrate three applications of GSS: (1) detecting prompt ambiguity and predicting clarification questions for better grounding, (2) interpreting overthinking and underthinking in reasoning models, and (3) steering models to expand their generation space to yield high-quality and diverse outputs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Agent Debate for LLM Judges with Adaptive Stability Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12697v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With advancements in reasoning capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed for automated judgment tasks. While LLMs-as-Judges offer promise in automating evaluations, current approaches often rely on simplistic aggregation methods (e.g., majority voting), which can fail even when individual agents provide correct answers. To address this, we propose a multi-agent debate judge framework where agents collaboratively reason and iteratively refine their responses. We formalize the debate process mathematically, analyzing agent interactions and proving that debate amplifies correctness compared to static ensembles. To enhance efficiency, we introduce a stability detection mechanism that models judge consensus dynamics via a time-varying Beta-Binomial mixture, with adaptive stopping based on distributional similarity (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test). This mechanism models the judges' collective correct rate dynamics using a time-varying mixture of Beta-Binomial distributions and employs an adaptive stopping criterion based on distributional similarity (Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic). Experiments across multiple benchmarks and models demonstrate that our framework improves judgment accuracy over majority voting while maintaining computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Delegates to Trustees: How Optimizing for Long-Term Interests Shapes Bias and Alignment in LLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12689v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising accuracy in predicting survey responses and policy preferences, which has increased interest in their potential to represent human interests in various domains. Most existing research has focused on behavioral cloning, effectively evaluating how well models reproduce individuals' expressed preferences. Drawing on theories of political representation, we highlight an underexplored design trade-off: whether AI systems should act as delegates, mirroring expressed preferences, or as trustees, exercising judgment about what best serves an individual's interests. This trade-off is closely related to issues of LLM sycophancy, where models can encourage behavior or validate beliefs that may be aligned with a user's short-term preferences, but is detrimental to their long-term interests. Through a series of experiments simulating votes on various policy issues in the U.S. context, we apply a temporal utility framework that weighs short and long-term interests (simulating a trustee role) and compare voting outcomes to behavior-cloning models (simulating a delegate). We find that trustee-style predictions weighted toward long-term interests produce policy decisions that align more closely with expert consensus on well-understood issues, but also show greater bias toward models' default stances on topics lacking clear agreement. These findings reveal a fundamental trade-off in designing AI systems to represent human interests. Delegate models better preserve user autonomy but may diverge from well-supported policy positions, while trustee models can promote welfare on well-understood issues yet risk paternalism and bias on subjective topics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Demystifying Hybrid Thinking: Can LLMs Truly Switch Between Think and No-Think?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12680v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hybrid thinking enables LLMs to switch between reasoning and direct answering, offering a balance between efficiency and reasoning capability. Yet our experiments reveal that current hybrid thinking LLMs only achieve partial mode separation: reasoning behaviors often leak into the no-think mode. To understand and mitigate this, we analyze the factors influencing controllability and identify four that matter most: (1) larger data scale, (2) using think and no-think answers from different questions rather than the same question, (3) a moderate increase in no-think data number, and (4) a two-phase strategy that first trains reasoning ability and then applies hybrid think training. Building on these findings, we propose a practical recipe that, compared to standard training, can maintain accuracy in both modes while significantly reducing no-think output length (from $1085$ to $585$ on MATH500) and occurrences of reasoning-supportive tokens such as ``\texttt{wait}'' (from $5917$ to $522$ on MATH500). Our findings highlight the limitations of current hybrid thinking and offer directions for strengthening its controllability.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures |

However, in domains aiming for carbon neutrality and high-performance renewable energy systems, current AI-assisted design automation methods face critical challenges in explainability, scalability, and practical usability. To address these limitations, we introduce PHIA (Physics-Informed Autonomous Agent), an LLM-driven system that automates modulation design for power converters in Power Electronics Systems with minimal human intervention. In contrast to traditional pipeline-based methods, PHIA incorporates an LLM-based planning module that interactively acquires and verifies design requirements via a user-friendly chat interface. This planner collaborates with physics-informed simulation and optimization components to autonomously generate and iteratively refine modulation designs. The interactive interface also supports interpretability by providing textual explanations and visual outputs throughout the design process. Experimental results show that PHIA reduces standard mean absolute error by 63.2% compared to the second-best benchmark and accelerates the overall design process by over 33 times. A user study involving 20 domain experts further confirms PHIA's superior design efficiency and usability, highlighting its potential to transform industrial design workflows in power electronics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2026 Innovative Applications of AI</p></details> |

Although existing compression methods reduce memory by evaluating the importance of individual tokens, they overlook critical semantic relationships between tokens, resulting in fragmented context and degraded performance. We introduce ChunkKV, which fundamentally reimagines KV cache compression by treating semantic chunks - rather than isolated tokens - as basic compression units. This approach preserves complete linguistic structures and contextual integrity, ensuring that essential meaning is retained even under aggressive compression. Our innovation includes a novel layer-wise index reuse technique that exploits the higher cross-layer similarity of preserved indices in ChunkKV, reducing computational overhead and improving throughput by 26.5\%. Comprehensive evaluations on challenging benchmarks: LongBench, Needle-In-A-HayStack, GSM8K, and JailbreakV demonstrate that ChunkKV outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 8.7\% in precision while maintaining the same compression ratio. These results confirm that semantic-aware compression significantly enhances both efficiency and performance for long-context LLM inference, providing a simple yet effective solution to the memory bottleneck problem.

However, the knowledge updating mechanism of LLMs remains largely unexplored due to insufficient, isolated, and small-scale evaluation. For instance, are LLMs similar to humans in modifying certain knowledge? What differs editing and unlearning as training data increases? This paper proposes KnowledgeSmith, a unified framework to systematically understand the updating mechanism of LLMs. We first cast editing and unlearning as instances of one constrained optimization problem. Then, we propose an automatic dataset generator that provides structured interventions across multiple graph levels and data scales, enabling controlled studies of how different modification strategies propagate through model knowledge. Extensive experiments demonstrate nuanced insights over knowledge propagation, plasticity scaling, consistency, and robustness. For instance, our results show that LLMs do not exhibit similar updating as humans for different levels of knowledge, and there exists consistency-capacity trade-off. We hope our findings can offer suggestions to the design of more reliable and scalable strategies. Code: https://github.com/AIFrontierLab/KnowledgeSmith.git</p></details> | Technical report |
| **[StyleDecipher: Robust and Explainable Detection of LLM-Generated Texts with Stylistic Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12608v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the increasing integration of large language models (LLMs) into open-domain writing, detecting machine-generated text has become a critical task for ensuring content authenticity and trust. Existing approaches rely on statistical discrepancies or model-specific heuristics to distinguish between LLM-generated and human-written text. However, these methods struggle in real-world scenarios due to limited generalization, vulnerability to paraphrasing, and lack of explainability, particularly when facing stylistic diversity or hybrid human-AI authorship. In this work, we propose StyleDecipher, a robust and explainable detection framework that revisits LLM-generated text detection using combined feature extractors to quantify stylistic differences. By jointly modeling discrete stylistic indicators and continuous stylistic representations derived from semantic embeddings, StyleDecipher captures distinctive style-level divergences between human and LLM outputs within a unified representation space. This framework enables accurate, explainable, and domain-agnostic detection without requiring access to model internals or labeled segments. Extensive experiments across five diverse domains, including news, code, essays, reviews, and academic abstracts, demonstrate that StyleDecipher consistently achieves state-of-the-art in-domain accuracy. Moreover, in cross-domain evaluations, it surpasses existing baselines by up to 36.30%, while maintaining robustness against adversarial perturbations and mixed human-AI content. Further qualitative and quantitative analysis confirms that stylistic signals provide explainable evidence for distinguishing machine-generated text.

| **[Clean First, Align Later: Benchmarking Preference Data Cleaning for Reliable LLM Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23564v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human feedback plays a pivotal role in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. However, such feedback is often noisy or inconsistent, which can degrade the quality of reward models and hinder alignment. While various automated data cleaning methods have been proposed to mitigate this issue, a systematic evaluation of their effectiveness and generalizability remains lacking. To bridge this gap, we introduce the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating 13 preference data cleaning methods in the context of LLM alignment. PrefCleanBench offers a standardized protocol to assess cleaning strategies in terms of alignment performance and generalizability across diverse datasets, model architectures, and optimization algorithms. By unifying disparate methods and rigorously comparing them, we uncover key factors that determine the success of data cleaning in alignment tasks. This benchmark lays the groundwork for principled and reproducible approaches to improving LLM alignment through better data quality-highlighting the crucial but underexplored role of data preprocessing in responsible AI development. We release modular implementations of all methods to catalyze further research: https://github.com/deeplearning-wisc/PrefCleanBench.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |

However, applying IBN effectively to the RAN scheduler [...] remains a significant challenge. Current approaches predominantly rely on coarse-grained network slicing, lacking the granularity for dynamic adaptation to individual user conditions and traffic patterns. Despite the existence of a vast body of scheduling algorithms [...], their practical utilization is hindered by implementation heterogeneity, insufficient systematic evaluation in production environments, and the complexity of developing high-performance scheduler implementations.[...] To address these limitations, we propose ALLSTaR (Automated LLm-driven Scheduler generation and Testing for intent-based RAN), a novel framework leveraging LLMs for automated, intent-driven scheduler design, implementation, and evaluation. ALLSTaR interprets NL intents, automatically generates functional scheduler code from the research literature using OCR and LLMs, and intelligently matches operator intents to the most suitable scheduler(s). Our implementation deploys these schedulers as O-RAN dApps, enabling on-the-fly deployment and testing on a production-grade, 5G-compliant testbed. This approach has enabled the largest-scale OTA experimental comparison of 18 scheduling algorithms automatically synthesized from the academic literature. The resulting performance profiles serve as the input for our Intent-Based Scheduling (IBS) framework, which dynamically selects and deploys appropriate schedulers that optimally satisfy operator intents. We validate our approach through multiple use cases unattainable with current slicing-based optimization techniques, demonstrating fine-grained control based on buffer status, physical layer conditions, and heterogeneous traffic types</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under submission to an IEEE journal, copyright may change without notice</p></details> |
| **[MooseAgent: A LLM Based Multi-agent Framework for Automating Moose Simulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08621v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Finite Element Method (FEM) is widely used in engineering and scientific computing, but its pre-processing, solver configuration, and post-processing stages are often time-consuming and require specialized knowledge. This paper proposes an automated solution framework, MooseAgent, for the multi-physics simulation framework MOOSE, which combines large-scale pre-trained language models (LLMs) with a multi-agent system. The framework uses LLMs to understand user-described simulation requirements in natural language and employs task decomposition and multi-round iterative verification strategies to automatically generate MOOSE input files. To improve accuracy and reduce model hallucinations, the system builds and utilizes a vector database containing annotated MOOSE input cards and function documentation. We conducted experimental evaluations on several typical cases, including heat transfer, mechanics, phase field, and multi-physics coupling. The results show that MooseAgent can automate the MOOSE simulation process to a certain extent, especially demonstrating a high success rate when dealing with relatively simple single-physics problems. The main contribution of this research is the proposal of a multi-agent automated framework for MOOSE, which validates its potential in simplifying finite element simulation processes and lowering the user barrier, providing new ideas for the development of intelligent finite element simulation software. The code for the MooseAgent framework proposed in this paper has been open-sourced and is available at https://github.com/taozhan18/MooseAgent</p></details> | 11 pages, 3 Figs |

Large language models (LLMs) introduce new dimensions to these challenges through their ability to generate persuasive content at scale and reinforcing existing biases. This study investigates the bidirectional persuasion dynamics between LLMs and humans when exposed to misinformative content. We analyze human-to-LLM influence using human-stance datasets and assess LLM-to-human influence by generating LLM-based persuasive arguments. Additionally, we use a multi-agent LLM framework to analyze the spread of misinformation under persuasion among demographic-oriented LLM agents. Our findings show that demographic factors influence susceptibility to misinformation in LLMs, closely reflecting the demographic-based patterns seen in human susceptibility. We also find that, similar to human demographic groups, multi-agent LLMs exhibit echo chamber behavior. This research explores the interplay between humans and LLMs, highlighting demographic differences in the context of misinformation and offering insights for future interventions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating and Mitigating LLM-as-a-judge Bias in Communication Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12462v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being used to autonomously evaluate the quality of content in communication systems, e.g., to assess responses in telecom customer support chatbots. However, the impartiality of these AI "judges" is not guaranteed, and any biases in their evaluation criteria could skew outcomes and undermine user trust. In this paper, we systematically investigate judgment biases in two LLM-as-a-judge models (i.e., GPT-Judge and JudgeLM) under the point-wise scoring setting, encompassing 11 types of biases that cover both implicit and explicit forms. We observed that state-of-the-art LLM judges demonstrate robustness to biased inputs, generally assigning them lower scores than the corresponding clean samples. Providing a detailed scoring rubric further enhances this robustness. We further found that fine-tuning an LLM on high-scoring yet biased responses can significantly degrade its performance, highlighting the risk of training on biased data. We also discovered that the judged scores correlate with task difficulty: a challenging dataset like GPQA yields lower average scores, whereas an open-ended reasoning dataset (e.g., JudgeLM-val) sees higher average scores. Finally, we proposed four potential mitigation strategies to ensure fair and reliable AI judging in practical communication scenarios.</p></details> |  |

However, synchronizing gradients in data parallel setups introduces communication overhead that grows with the number of workers, limiting parallelization efficiency. Local optimization algorithms reduce communications but incur high memory costs as they prevent optimizer state sharding, hindering scalability. To address this, we propose \textbf{AC}cumulate while \textbf{CO}mmunicate (ACCO), a memory-efficient optimization algorithm for distributed LLM training. By synchronizing delayed gradients while computing new ones, ACCO reduces GPU idle time and supports heterogeneous hardware. To mitigate the convergence issues caused by delayed updates, we introduce a novel technique ensuring training dynamics align with standard distributed optimization. Compared to ZeRO-1, our approach is significantly faster and scales effectively across heterogeneous hardware.</p></details> |  |
| **[MTOS: A LLM-Driven Multi-topic Opinion Simulation Framework for Exploring Echo Chamber Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12423v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The polarization of opinions, information segregation, and cognitive biases on social media have attracted significant academic attention. In real-world networks, information often spans multiple interrelated topics, posing challenges for opinion evolution and highlighting the need for frameworks that simulate interactions among topics. Existing studies based on large language models (LLMs) focus largely on single topics, limiting the capture of cognitive transfer in multi-topic, cross-domain contexts. Traditional numerical models, meanwhile, simplify complex linguistic attitudes into discrete values, lacking interpretability, behavioral consistency, and the ability to integrate multiple topics. To address these issues, we propose Multi-topic Opinion Simulation (MTOS), a social simulation framework integrating multi-topic contexts with LLMs. MTOS leverages LLMs alongside short-term and long-term memory, incorporates multiple user-selection interaction mechanisms and dynamic topic-selection strategies, and employs a belief decay mechanism to enable perspective updates across topics. We conduct extensive experiments on MTOS, varying topic numbers, correlation types, and performing ablation studies to assess features such as group polarization and local consistency. Results show that multi-topic settings significantly alter polarization trends: positively correlated topics amplify echo chambers, negatively correlated topics inhibit them, and irrelevant topics also mitigate echo chamber effects through resource competition. Compared with numerical models, LLM-based agents realistically simulate dynamic opinion changes, reproduce linguistic features of news texts, and capture complex human reasoning, improving simulation interpretability and system stability.</p></details> | 14 pages, 11figures |

Travel agencies are eager to offload this error-prone task onto AI systems; however, deploying LLMs without verified reliability could result in significant financial losses and erode customer trust. PricingLogic comprises 300 natural-language questions based on booking requests derived from 42 real-world pricing policies, spanning two levels of difficulty: (i) basic customer-type pricing and (ii)bundled-tour calculations involving interacting discounts. Evaluations of a line of LLMs reveal a steep performance drop on the harder tier,exposing systematic failures in rule interpretation and arithmetic reasoning.These results highlight that, despite their general capabilities, today's LLMs remain unreliable in revenue-critical applications without further safeguards or domain adaptation. Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/EIT-NLP/PricingLogic.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Graph Descriptive Order Affect Solving Graph Problems with LLMs?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07140v6)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved significant success in reasoning tasks, including mathematical reasoning and logical deduction. Among these reasoning tasks, graph problems stand out due to their complexity and unique structural characteristics, attracting considerable attention from researchers. Previous studies have explored LLMs' graph reasoning abilities through various techniques, such as different encoding methods for graph structures and the use of carefully designed prompts. However, a critical factor has been mostly overlooked: the prompt sequential order in which graph descriptions are presented to the models. In this study, we present the first comprehensive analysis of how the order of graph descriptions impacts LLM performance. Specifically, we comprehensively evaluate four graph description orders across six graph problems using six mainstream LLMs. The results reveal that: (1) ordered graph descriptions significantly improve LLMs' comprehension of graph structures; (2) the robustness of LLMs to graph description order varies across different tasks; and (3) the impact of graph order on performance is closely related to the inherent characteristics of tasks. This study provides a critical advancement in the application of LLMs for solving graph-related problems, paving the way for future research to optimize model performance through strategic graph description ordering.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL 2025 main conference</p></details> |

This study conducts a large-scale cross-linguistic evaluation of tokenization efficiency in over 200 languages to systematically quantify computational inequities in large language models (LLMs). Using a standardized experimental framework, we applied consistent preprocessing and normalization protocols, followed by uniform tokenization through the tiktoken library across all language samples. Comprehensive tokenization statistics were collected using established evaluation metrics, including Tokens Per Sentence (TPS) and Relative Tokenization Cost (RTC), benchmarked against English baselines. Our cross-linguistic analysis reveals substantial and systematic disparities: Latin-script languages consistently exhibit higher tokenization efficiency, while non-Latin and morphologically complex languages incur significantly greater token inflation, often 3-5 times higher RTC ratios. These inefficiencies translate into increased computational costs and reduced effective context utilization for underrepresented languages. Overall, the findings highlight structural inequities in current AI systems, where speakers of low-resource and non-Latin languages face disproportionate computational disadvantages. Future research should prioritize the development of linguistically informed tokenization strategies and adaptive vocabulary construction methods that incorporate typological diversity, ensuring more inclusive and computationally equitable multilingual AI systems.</p></details> | 6 pages 4 figures |

While previous studies highlight the potential of LLMs in supporting research and peer review, their dual roles in the academic workflow and the complex interplay between research and review bring new risks that remain largely underexplored. In this study, we focus on how the deep integration of LLMs into both peer-review and research processes may influence scholarly fairness, examining the potential risks of using LLMs as reviewers by simulation. This simulation incorporates a research agent, which generates papers and revises, alongside a review agent, which assesses the submissions. Based on the simulation results, we conduct human annotations and identify pronounced misalignment between LLM-based reviews and human judgments: (1) LLM reviewers systematically inflate scores for LLM-authored papers, assigning them markedly higher scores than human-authored ones; (2) LLM reviewers persistently underrate human-authored papers with critical statements (e.g., risk, fairness), even after multiple revisions. Our analysis reveals that these stem from two primary biases in LLM reviewers: a linguistic feature bias favoring LLM-generated writing styles, and an aversion toward critical statements. These results highlight the risks and equity concerns posed to human authors and academic research if LLMs are deployed in the peer review cycle without adequate caution. On the other hand, revisions guided by LLM reviews yield quality gains in both LLM-based and human evaluations, illustrating the potential of the LLMs-as-reviewers for early-stage researchers and enhancing low-quality papers.</p></details> |  |

We introduce a fine-grained input attribution method to identify the specific words most important for brain-LLM alignment, and leverage it to study a contentious research question about brain-LLM alignment: the relationship between brain alignment (BA) and next-word prediction (NWP). Our findings reveal that BA and NWP rely on largely distinct word subsets: NWP exhibits recency and primacy biases with a focus on syntax, while BA prioritizes semantic and discourse-level information with a more targeted recency effect. This work advances our understanding of how LLMs relate to human language processing and highlights differences in feature reliance between BA and NWP. Beyond this study, our attribution method can be broadly applied to explore the cognitive relevance of model predictions in diverse language processing tasks.</p></details> |  |

The key difficulty is verification: suggested proofs may look plausible, but cannot be trusted without rigorous checking. We present a framework, called LLM+CAS, and an associated tool, O-Forge, that couples frontier LLMs with a computer algebra systems (CAS) in an In-Context Symbolic Feedback loop to produce proofs that are both creative and symbolically verified. Our focus is on asymptotic inequalities, a topic that often involves difficult proofs and appropriate decomposition of the domain into the "right" subdomains. Many mathematicians, including Terry Tao, have suggested that using AI tools to find the right decompositions can be very useful for research-level asymptotic analysis. In this paper, we show that our framework LLM+CAS turns out to be remarkably effective at proposing such decompositions via a combination of a frontier LLM and a CAS. More precisely, we use an LLM to suggest domain decomposition, and a CAS (such as Mathematica) that provides a verification of each piece axiomatically. Using this loop, we answer a question posed by Terence Tao: whether LLMs coupled with a verifier can be used to help prove intricate asymptotic inequalities. More broadly, we show how AI can move beyond contest math towards research-level tools for professional mathematicians.</p></details> |  |

We address this challenge by presenting a scalable, unsupervised pipeline for automating grammatical annotation in voluminous corpora using large language models (LLMs). Unlike previous supervised and iterative approaches, our method employs a four-phase workflow: prompt engineering, pre-hoc evaluation, automated batch processing, and post-hoc validation. We demonstrate the pipeline's accessibility and effectiveness through a diachronic case study of variation in the English consider construction. Using GPT-5 through the OpenAI API, we annotate 143,933 sentences from the Corpus of Historical American English (COHA) in under 60 hours, achieving 98%+ accuracy on two sophisticated annotation procedures. Our results suggest that LLMs can perform a range of data preparation tasks at scale with minimal human intervention, opening new possibilities for corpus-based research, though implementation requires attention to costs, licensing, and other ethical considerations.</p></details> |  |

A Scoping Review on Verbalization in Software Engineering with LLM-Assisted Screening](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12294v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding how software developers think, make decisions, and behave remains a key challenge in software engineering (SE). Verbalization techniques (methods that capture spoken or written thought processes) offer a lightweight and accessible way to study these cognitive aspects. This paper presents a scoping review of research at the intersection of SE and psychology (PSY), focusing on the use of verbal data. To make large-scale interdisciplinary reviews feasible, we employed a large language model (LLM)-assisted screening pipeline using GPT to assess the relevance of over 9,000 papers based solely on titles. We addressed two questions: what themes emerge from verbalization-related work in SE, and how effective are LLMs in supporting interdisciplinary review processes? We validated GPT's outputs against human reviewers and found high consistency, with a 13\% disagreement rate. Prominent themes mainly were tied to the craft of SE, while more human-centered topics were underrepresented. The data also suggests that SE frequently draws on PSY methods, whereas the reverse is rare.</p></details> | <details><summary>prepr...</summary><p>preprint of a paper under publication in Quality of Information and Communications Technology 2025</p></details> |

A faithful judge should base its verdicts solely on response quality and explicitly acknowledge the factors shaping its decision. We show that current LLM judges fail on both counts by relying on shortcuts introduced in the prompt. Our study uses two evaluation datasets: ELI5, a benchmark for long-form question answering, and LitBench, a recent benchmark for creative writing. Both datasets provide pairwise comparisons, where the evaluator must choose which of two responses is better. From each dataset we construct 100 pairwise judgment tasks and employ two widely used models, GPT-4o and Gemini-2.5-Flash, as evaluators in the role of LLM-as-a-judge. For each pair, we assign superficial cues to the responses, provenance cues indicating source identity (Human, Expert, LLM, or Unknown) and recency cues indicating temporal origin (Old, 1950 vs. New, 2025), while keeping the rest of the prompt fixed. Results reveal consistent verdict shifts: both models exhibit a strong recency bias, systematically favoring new responses over old, as well as a clear provenance hierarchy (Expert > Human > LLM > Unknown). These biases are especially pronounced in GPT-4o and in the more subjective and open-ended LitBench domain. Crucially, cue acknowledgment is rare: justifications almost never reference the injected cues, instead rationalizing decisions in terms of content qualities. These findings demonstrate that current LLM-as-a-judge systems are shortcut-prone and unfaithful, undermining their reliability as evaluators in both research and deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 Pag...</summary><p>9 Pages, 5 Tables, 1 Figures</p></details> |
| **[Unspoken Hints: Accuracy Without Acknowledgement in LLM Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26041v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) increasingly rely on chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to solve mathematical and logical reasoning tasks. Yet, a central question remains: to what extent are these generated rationales \emph{faithful} to the underlying computations, rather than post-hoc narratives shaped by hints that function as answer shortcuts embedded in the prompt? Following prior work on hinted vs.\ unhinted prompting, we present a systematic study of CoT faithfulness under controlled hint manipulations. Our experimental design spans four datasets (AIME, GSM-Hard, MATH-500, UniADILR), two state-of-the-art models (GPT-4o and Gemini-2-Flash), and a structured set of hint conditions varying in correctness (correct and incorrect), presentation style (sycophancy and data leak), and complexity (raw answers, two-operator expressions, four-operator expressions). We evaluate both task accuracy and whether hints are explicitly acknowledged in the reasoning. Our results reveal three key findings. First, correct hints substantially improve accuracy, especially on harder benchmarks and logical reasoning, while incorrect hints sharply reduce accuracy in tasks with lower baseline competence. Second, acknowledgement of hints is highly uneven: equation-based hints are frequently referenced, whereas raw hints are often adopted silently, indicating that more complex hints push models toward verbalizing their reliance in the reasoning process. Third, presentation style matters: sycophancy prompts encourage overt acknowledgement, while leak-style prompts increase accuracy but promote hidden reliance. This may reflect RLHF-related effects, as sycophancy exploits the human-pleasing side and data leak triggers the self-censoring side. Together, these results demonstrate that LLM reasoning is systematically shaped by shortcuts in ways that obscure faithfulness.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 Pag...</summary><p>5 Pages, 4 Figures, 4 Tables</p></details> |
| **[Shallow Robustness, Deep Vulnerabilities: Multi-Turn Evaluation of Medical LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12255v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly transitioning into medical clinical use, yet their reliability under realistic, multi-turn interactions remains poorly understood. Existing evaluation frameworks typically assess single-turn question answering under idealized conditions, overlooking the complexities of medical consultations where conflicting input, misleading context, and authority influence are common. We introduce MedQA-Followup, a framework for systematically evaluating multi-turn robustness in medical question answering. Our approach distinguishes between shallow robustness (resisting misleading initial context) and deep robustness (maintaining accuracy when answers are challenged across turns), while also introducing an indirect-direct axis that separates contextual framing (indirect) from explicit suggestion (direct). Using controlled interventions on the MedQA dataset, we evaluate five state-of-the-art LLMs and find that while models perform reasonably well under shallow perturbations, they exhibit severe vulnerabilities in multi-turn settings, with accuracy dropping from 91.2% to as low as 13.5% for Claude Sonnet 4. Counterintuitively, indirect, context-based interventions are often more harmful than direct suggestions, yielding larger accuracy drops across models and exposing a significant vulnerability for clinical deployment. Further compounding analyses reveal model differences, with some showing additional performance drops under repeated interventions while others partially recovering or even improving. These findings highlight multi-turn robustness as a critical but underexplored dimension for safe and reliable deployment of medical LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Datas...</summary><p>Dataset and code: https://huggingface.co/datasets/dynamoai-ml/MedQA-USMLE-4-MultiTurnRobust ; https://github.com/bmanczak/MedQA-MultiTurnRobustness Accepted as a poster at NeurIPS 2025 Workshop on GenAI for Health: Potential, Trust, and Policy Compliance</p></details> |
| **[Your Pre-trained LLM is Secretly an Unsupervised Confidence Calibrator](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16690v3)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Post-training of large language models is essential for adapting pre-trained language models (PLMs) to align with human preferences and downstream tasks. While PLMs typically exhibit well-calibrated confidence, post-trained language models (PoLMs) often suffer from over-confidence, assigning high confidence to both correct and incorrect outputs, which can undermine reliability in critical applications. A major obstacle in calibrating PoLMs is the scarcity of labeled data for individual downstream tasks. To address this, we propose Disagreement-Aware Confidence Alignment (DACA), a novel unsupervised method to optimize the parameters (e.g., temperature $\tau$) in post-hoc confidence calibration. Our method is motivated by the under-confidence issue caused by prediction disagreement between the PLM and PoLM while aligning their confidence via temperature scaling. Theoretically, the PLM's confidence underestimates PoLM's prediction accuracy on disagreement examples, causing a larger $\tau$ and producing under-confident predictions. DACA mitigates this by selectively using only agreement examples for calibration, effectively decoupling the influence of disagreement. In this manner, our method avoids an overly large $\tau$ in temperature scaling caused by disagreement examples, improving calibration performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, improving the average ECE of open-sourced and API-based LLMs (e.g. GPT-4o) by up to 15.08$\%$ on common benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[MoRA: On-the-fly Molecule-aware Low-Rank Adaptation Framework for LLM-based Multi-Modal Molecular Assistant](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12245v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effectively integrating molecular graph structures with Large Language Models (LLMs) is a key challenge in drug discovery. Most existing multi-modal alignment methods typically process these structures by fine-tuning the LLM or adding a static adapter simultaneously. However, these approaches have two main limitations: (1) it optimizes a shared parameter space across all molecular inputs, limiting the model's ability to capture instance-specific structural features; and (2) fine-tuning the LLM for molecular tasks can lead to catastrophic forgetting, undermining its general reasoning capabilities. In this paper, instead of static task-oriented adaptation, we propose an instance-specific parameter space alignment approach for each molecule on-the-fly. To this end, we introduce Molecule-aware Low-Rank Adaptation (MoRA) that produces a unique set of low-rank adaptation weights for each input molecular graph. These weights are then dynamically injected into a frozen LLM, allowing the model to adapt its reasoning to the structure of each molecular input, while preserving the LLM's core knowledge. Extensive experiments demonstrate that on key molecular tasks, such as chemical reaction prediction and molecular captioning, MoRA's instance-specific dynamic adaptation outperforms statically adapted baselines, including a 14.1% relative improvement in reaction prediction exact match and a 22% reduction in error for quantum property prediction. The code is available at https://github.com/jk-sounds/MoRA.</p></details> |  |
| **[Analysing Moral Bias in Finetuned LLMs through Mechanistic Interpretability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12229v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have been shown to internalize human-like biases during finetuning, yet the mechanisms by which these biases manifest remain unclear. In this work, we investigated whether the well-known Knobe effect, a moral bias in intentionality judgements, emerges in finetuned LLMs and whether it can be traced back to specific components of the model. We conducted a Layer-Patching analysis across 3 open-weights LLMs and demonstrated that the bias is not only learned during finetuning but also localized in a specific set of layers. Surprisingly, we found that patching activations from the corresponding pretrained model into just a few critical layers is sufficient to eliminate the effect. Our findings offer new evidence that social biases in LLMs can be interpreted, localized, and mitigated through targeted interventions, without the need for model retraining.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

Existing evaluation methods typically rely on post hoc review of full conversation transcripts, thereby neglecting the dynamic, context-sensitive nature of medical dialogues and the evolving informational needs of patients. In this work, we present MedKGEval, a novel multi-turn evaluation framework for clinical LLMs grounded in structured medical knowledge. Our approach introduces three key contributions: (1) a knowledge graph-driven patient simulation mechanism, where a dedicated control module retrieves relevant medical facts from a curated knowledge graph, thereby endowing the patient agent with human-like and realistic conversational behavior. This knowledge graph is constructed by integrating open-source resources with additional triples extracted from expert-annotated datasets; (2) an in-situ, turn-level evaluation framework, where each model response is assessed by a Judge Agent for clinical appropriateness, factual correctness, and safety as the dialogue progresses using a suite of fine-grained, task-specific metrics; (3) a comprehensive multi-turn benchmark of eight state-of-the-art LLMs, demonstrating MedKGEval's ability to identify subtle behavioral flaws and safety risks that are often overlooked by conventional evaluation pipelines. Although initially designed for Chinese and English medical applications, our framework can be readily extended to additional languages by switching the input knowledge graphs, ensuring seamless bilingual support and domain-specific applicability.</p></details> |  |
| **[HALF: Harm-Aware LLM Fairness Evaluation Aligned with Deployment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12217v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed across high-impact domains, from clinical decision support and legal analysis to hiring and education, making fairness and bias evaluation before deployment critical. However, existing evaluations lack grounding in real-world scenarios and do not account for differences in harm severity, e.g., a biased decision in surgery should not be weighed the same as a stylistic bias in text summarization. To address this gap, we introduce HALF (Harm-Aware LLM Fairness), a deployment-aligned framework that assesses model bias in realistic applications and weighs the outcomes by harm severity. HALF organizes nine application domains into three tiers (Severe, Moderate, Mild) using a five-stage pipeline. Our evaluation results across eight LLMs show that (1) LLMs are not consistently fair across domains, (2) model size or performance do not guarantee fairness, and (3) reasoning models perform better in medical decision support but worse in education. We conclude that HALF exposes a clear gap between previous benchmarking success and deployment readiness.</p></details> |  |
| **[AdaptJobRec: Enhancing Conversational Career Recommendation through an LLM-Powered Agentic System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13423v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, recommendation systems have evolved from providing a single list of recommendations to offering a comprehensive suite of topic focused services. To better accomplish this task, conversational recommendation systems (CRS) have progressed from basic retrieval augmented LLM generation to agentic systems with advanced reasoning and self correction capabilities. However, agentic systems come with notable response latency, a longstanding challenge for conversational recommendation systems. To balance the trade off between handling complex queries and minimizing latency, we propose AdaptJobRec, the first conversational job recommendation system that leverages autonomous agent to integrate personalized recommendation algorithm tools. The system employs a user query complexity identification mechanism to minimize response latency. For straightforward queries, the agent directly selects the appropriate tool for rapid responses. For complex queries, the agent uses the memory processing module to filter chat history for relevant content, then passes the results to the intelligent task decomposition planner, and finally executes the tasks using personalized recommendation tools. Evaluation on Walmart's real world career recommendation scenarios demonstrates that AdaptJobRec reduces average response latency by up to 53.3% compared to competitive baselines, while significantly improving recommendation accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[ICL-Router: In-Context Learned Model Representations for LLM Routing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09719v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit complementary strengths. Model routing harnesses these strengths by dynamically directing each query to the most suitable model, given a candidate model pool. However, routing performance relies on accurate model representations, and adding new models typically requires retraining, limiting scalability. To address these challenges, we propose a novel routing method using in-context vectors to represent model capabilities. The method proceeds in two stages. First, queries are embedded and projected into vectors, with a projector and LLM-based router trained to reconstruct the original queries, aligning vector representations with the router's semantic space. Second, each candidate model is profiled on a query set, and the router learns -- based on in-context vectors of query and model performance -- to predict whether each model can correctly answer new queries. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art routing performance in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution tasks. Moreover, our method allows for seamless integration of new models without retraining the router. The code is available at https://github.com/lalalamdbf/ICL-Router.</p></details> | preprint |
| **[When "Competency" in Reasoning Opens the Door to Vulnerability: Jailbreaking LLMs via Novel Complex Ciphers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10601v5)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Large Language Model (LLM) safety have primarily focused on mitigating attacks crafted in natural language or common ciphers (e.g. Base64), which are likely integrated into newer models' safety training. However, we reveal a paradoxical vulnerability: as LLMs advance in reasoning, they inadvertently become more susceptible to novel jailbreaking attacks. Enhanced reasoning enables LLMs to interpret complex instructions and decode complex user-defined ciphers, creating an exploitable security gap. To study this vulnerability, we introduce Attacks using Custom Encryptions (ACE), a jailbreaking technique that encodes malicious queries with novel ciphers. Extending ACE, we introduce Layered Attacks using Custom Encryptions (LACE), which applies multi-layer ciphers to amplify attack complexity. Furthermore, we develop CipherBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' accuracy in decoding encrypted benign text. Our experiments reveal a critical trade-off: LLMs that are more capable of decoding ciphers are more vulnerable to LACE, with success rates on gpt-oss-20b escalating from 60% under ACE to 72% with LACE. These findings highlight a critical insight: as LLMs become more adept at deciphering complex user ciphers--many of which cannot be preemptively included in safety training--they become increasingly exploitable.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Reliable ML from Unreliable Data workshop @ NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Stronger Together: On-Policy Reinforcement Learning for Collaborative LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11062v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent systems (MAS) and reinforcement learning (RL) are widely used to enhance the agentic capabilities of large language models (LLMs). MAS improves task performance through role-based orchestration, while RL uses environmental rewards to learn stronger policies, such as GRPO-style optimization. However, applying on-policy RL to MAS remains underexplored and presents unique challenges. Algorithmically, standard GRPO grouping assumptions break down because prompts vary by role and by turn. System-wise, the training stack must support MAS-workflow rollouts and on-policy updates for both single-policy and multi-policy models. We propose AT-GRPO, which includes (i) an agent- and turn-wise grouped RL algorithm tailored to MAS and (ii) a training system that supports both single- and multi-policy regimes. Across game, planning, coding, and math tasks, AT-GRPO delivers substantial gains. On long-horizon planning, it increases accuracy from a 14.0 to 47.0 percent single-agent RL baseline to 96.0 to 99.5 percent. It also improves reasoning performance, with average gains of 3.87 to 7.62 percent on coding tasks and 9.0 to 17.93 percent on math.

| **[Attention-Aware GNN-based Input Defense against Multi-Turn LLM Jailbreak](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07146v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained significant traction in various applications, yet their capabilities present risks for both constructive and malicious exploitation. Despite extensive training and fine-tuning efforts aimed at enhancing safety, LLMs remain susceptible to jailbreak attacks. Recently, the emergence of multi-turn attacks has intensified this vulnerability. Unlike single-turn attacks, multi-turn attacks incrementally escalate dialogue complexity, rendering them more challenging to detect and mitigate. In this study, we introduce G-Guard, an innovative attention-aware Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based input classifier specifically designed to defend against multi-turn jailbreak attacks targeting LLMs. G-Guard constructs an entity graph for multi-turn queries, which captures the interrelationships between queries and harmful keywords that present in multi-turn queries. Furthermore, we propose an attention-aware augmentation mechanism that retrieves the most relevant single-turn query based on the ongoing multi-turn conversation. The retrieved query is incorporated as a labeled node within the graph, thereby enhancing the GNN's capacity to classify the current query as harmful or benign. Evaluation results show that G-Guard consistently outperforms all baselines across diverse datasets and evaluation metrics, demonstrating its efficacy as a robust defense mechanism against multi-turn jailbreak attacks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Engineering Multi-Agent LLMs: A Protocol-Driven Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12120v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing demand for software development has driven interest in automating software engineering (SE) tasks using Large Language Models (LLMs). Recent efforts extend LLMs into multi-agent systems (MAS) that emulate collaborative development workflows, but these systems often fail due to three core deficiencies: under-specification, coordination misalignment, and inappropriate verification, arising from the absence of foundational SE structuring principles. This paper introduces Software Engineering Multi-Agent Protocol (SEMAP), a protocol-layer methodology that instantiates three core SE design principles for multi-agent LLMs: (1) explicit behavioral contract modeling, (2) structured messaging, and (3) lifecycle-guided execution with verification, and is implemented atop Google's Agent-to-Agent (A2A) infrastructure. Empirical evaluation using the Multi-Agent System Failure Taxonomy (MAST) framework demonstrates that SEMAP effectively reduces failures across different SE tasks. In code development, it achieves up to a 69.6% reduction in total failures for function-level development and 56.7% for deployment-level development. For vulnerability detection, SEMAP reduces failure counts by up to 47.4% on Python tasks and 28.2% on C/C++ tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can LLMs Reconcile Knowledge Conflicts in Counterfactual Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15732v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models have been shown to contain extensive world knowledge in their parameters, enabling impressive performance on many knowledge intensive tasks. However, when deployed in novel settings, LLMs often encounter situations where they must integrate parametric knowledge with new or unfamiliar information. In this work, we explore whether LLMs can combine knowledge in-context with their parametric knowledge through the lens of counterfactual reasoning. Through synthetic and real experiments in multi-hop reasoning problems, we show that LLMs generally struggle with counterfactual reasoning, often resorting to exclusively using their parametric knowledge. Moreover, we show that simple post-hoc finetuning can struggle to instill counterfactual reasoning ability -- often leading to degradation in stored parametric knowledge. Ultimately, our work reveals important limitations of current LLM's abilities to re-purpose parametric knowledge in novel settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2025 Workshop on Scaling up Intervention Models</p></details> |

This shift is largely pragmatic: conventional value functions are computationally expensive to train at LLM scale and often fail under sparse rewards and long reasoning horizons. We revisit this bottleneck from an architectural perspective and introduce Asymmetric Proximal Policy Optimization (AsyPPO), a simple and scalable framework that restores the critics role while remaining efficient in large-model settings. AsyPPO employs a set of lightweight mini-critics, each trained on disjoint prompt shards. This design encourages diversity while preserving calibration, reducing value-estimation bias. Beyond robust estimation, AsyPPO leverages inter-critic uncertainty to refine the policy update: (i) masking advantages in states where critics agree and gradients add little learning signal, and (ii) filtering high-divergence states from entropy regularization, suppressing spurious exploration. After training on open-source data with only 5,000 samples, AsyPPO consistently improves learning stability and performance across multiple benchmarks over strong baselines, such as GRPO, achieving performance gains of more than six percent on Qwen3-4b-Base and about three percent on Qwen3-8b-Base and Qwen3-14b-Base over classic PPO, without additional tricks. These results highlight the importance of architectural innovations for scalable, efficient algorithms.</p></details> |  |

To further enhance generalization ability while reducing training costs, this paper proposes Federated LoRA with Dropout (FedLoDrop), a new framework that applies dropout to the rows and columns of the trainable matrix in Federated LoRA. A generalization error bound and convergence analysis under sparsity regularization are obtained, which elucidate the fundamental trade-off between underfitting and overfitting. The error bound reveals that a higher dropout rate increases model sparsity, thereby lowering the upper bound of pointwise hypothesis stability (PHS). While this reduces the gap between empirical and generalization errors, it also incurs a higher empirical error, which, together with the gap, determines the overall generalization error. On the other hand, though dropout reduces communication costs, deploying FedLoDrop at the network edge still faces challenges due to limited network resources. To address this issue, an optimization problem is formulated to minimize the upper bound of the generalization error, by jointly optimizing the dropout rate and resource allocation subject to the latency and per-device energy consumption constraints. To solve this problem, a branch-and-bound (B\&B)-based method is proposed to obtain its globally optimal solution. Moreover, to reduce the high computational complexity of the B\&B-based method, a penalized successive convex approximation (P-SCA)-based algorithm is proposed to efficiently obtain its high-quality suboptimal solution. Finally, numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in mitigating overfitting and improving the generalization capability.</p></details> |  |
| **[EvolveNav: Empowering LLM-Based Vision-Language Navigation via Self-Improving Embodied Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01551v3)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have revealed the potential of training open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) to unleash LLMs' reasoning ability for enhancing vision-language navigation (VLN) performance, and simultaneously mitigate the domain gap between LLMs' training corpus and the VLN task. However, these approaches predominantly adopt straightforward input-output mapping paradigms, causing the mapping learning difficult and the navigational decisions unexplainable. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) training is a promising way to improve both navigational decision accuracy and interpretability, while the complexity of the navigation task makes the perfect CoT labels unavailable and may lead to overfitting through pure CoT supervised fine-tuning. To address these issues, we propose EvolveNav, a novel sElf-improving embodied reasoning paradigm that realizes adaptable and generalizable navigational reasoning for boosting LLM-based vision-language Navigation. Specifically, EvolveNav involves a two-stage training process: (1) Formalized CoT Supervised Fine-Tuning, where we train the model with curated formalized CoT labels to first activate the model's navigational reasoning capabilities, and simultaneously increase the reasoning speed; (2) Self-Reflective Post-Training, where the model is iteratively trained with its own reasoning outputs as self-enriched CoT labels to enhance the supervision diversity. A self-reflective auxiliary task is also designed to encourage the model to learn correct reasoning patterns by contrasting with wrong ones. Experimental results under both task-specific and cross-task training paradigms demonstrate the consistent superiority of EvolveNav over previous LLM-based VLN approaches on various popular benchmarks, including R2R, REVERIE, CVDN, and SOON. Code is available at https://github.com/expectorlin/EvolveNav.</p></details> |  |

Existing statistical approaches often lack semantic context, generalize poorly across events, and offer limited interpretability. While Large language models (LLMs) provide few-shot generalization, they remain text-bound and blind to geography. To bridge this gap, we introduce a Geospatial Awareness Layer (GAL) that grounds LLM agents in structured earth data. Starting from raw wildfire detections, GAL automatically retrieves and integrates infrastructure, demographic, terrain, and weather information from external geodatabases, assembling them into a concise, unit-annotated perception script. This enriched context enables agents to produce evidence-based resource-allocation recommendations (e.g., personnel assignments, budget allocations), further reinforced by historical analogs and daily change signals for incremental updates. We evaluate the framework in real wildfire scenarios across multiple LLM models, showing that geospatially grounded agents can outperform baselines. The proposed framework can generalize to other hazards such as floods and hurricanes.</p></details> |  |

The field now faces a critical dilemma in its approach: closed-source models like GPT-4 deliver state-of-the-art performance but restrict reproducibility, accessibility, and external oversight, while open-source frameworks like LLaMA and Mixtral democratize access, foster collaboration, and support diverse applications, achieving competitive results through techniques like instruction tuning and LoRA. Hybrid approaches address challenges like bias mitigation and resource accessibility by combining the scalability of closed-source systems with the transparency and inclusivity of open-source framework. However, in this position paper, we argue that open-source remains the most robust path for advancing LLM research and ethical deployment.</p></details> | 9 pages, 1 figure |

An Evaluation via the Lens of Data Structures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24069v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) take on increasingly complex tasks, understanding their algorithmic reasoning abilities has become essential. However, existing evaluations focus on distinct and isolated tasks. We propose a unified diagnostic lens: structural reasoning--understanding and manipulating relationships like order, hierarchy, and connectivity. We introduce DSR-Bench, the first benchmark to systematically evaluate LLM structural reasoning through canonical data structures, which serve as interpretable, algorithmically meaningful abstractions. DSR-Bench spans 20 data structures, 35 operations, and 4,140 synthetically generated problem instances with minimal contamination. The benchmark's hierarchical design pinpoints specific failure modes, while its fully automated evaluation ensures objective and consistent assessment. Benchmarking ten state-of-the-art LLMs reveals critical limitations: the top-performing model scores only 0.498 out of 1 on challenging instances. Three additional evaluation suites reveal further weaknesses: models perform poorly on spatial data and natural language scenarios, and fail to reason over their own generated code. DSR-Bench offers a principled diagnostic tool for structural reasoning, helping expose reasoning bottlenecks and guide the development of more capable and reliable LLMs.</p></details> |  |

This paper compares a neuro-symbolic (NS) and an LLM-based IE system in the agricultural domain, evaluating them on nine interviews across pork, dairy, and crop subdomains. The LLM-based system outperforms the NS one (F1 total: 69.4 vs. 52.7; core: 63.0 vs. 47.2), where total includes all extracted information and core focuses on essential details. However, each system has trade-offs: the NS approach offers faster runtime, greater control, and high accuracy in context-free tasks but lacks generalizability, struggles with contextual nuances, and requires significant resources to develop and maintain. The LLM-based system achieves higher performance, faster deployment, and easier maintenance but has slower runtime, limited control, model dependency and hallucination risks. Our findings highlight the "hidden cost" of deploying NLP systems in real-world applications, emphasizing the need to balance performance, efficiency, and control.</p></details> | 15 pages, 2 figures |
| **[MergeBench: A Benchmark for Merging Domain-Specialized LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10833v4)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model merging provides a scalable alternative to multi-task training by combining specialized finetuned models through parameter arithmetic, enabling efficient deployment without the need for joint training or access to all task data. While recent methods have shown promise, existing evaluations are limited in both model scale and task diversity, leaving open questions about their applicability to large, domain-specialized LLMs. To tackle the challenges, we introduce MergeBench, a comprehensive evaluation suite designed to assess model merging at scale. MergeBench builds on state-of-the-art open-source language models, including Llama and Gemma families at 2B to 9B scales, and covers five key domains: instruction following, mathematics, multilingual understanding, coding and safety. We standardize finetuning and evaluation protocols, and assess eight representative merging methods across multi-task performance, forgetting and runtime efficiency. Based on extensive experiments, we provide practical guidelines for algorithm selection and share insights showing that model merging tends to perform better on stronger base models, with techniques such as merging coefficient tuning and sparsification improving knowledge retention. However, several challenges remain, including the computational cost on large models, the gap for in-domain performance compared to multi-task models, and the underexplored role of model merging in standard LLM training pipelines. We hope MergeBench provides a foundation for future research to advance the understanding and practical application of model merging.

| **[Phaedrus: Predicting Dynamic Application Behavior with Lightweight Generative Models and LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06994v3)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Application profiling is an indispensable technique for many software development tasks, such as code and memory layout optimizations, where optimization decisions are tailored to specific program profiles. Unfortunately, modern application codebases exhibit highly variant behavior across different inputs, creating challenges for conventional profiling approaches that rely on a single representative execution instance. In this paper, we propose \textbf{Phaedrus}, a new \textit{compiler-assisted deep learning framework} designed to predict dynamic program behaviors across varied execution instances, specifically focusing on dynamic function call prediction.Such predicted call sequences are then used for producing optimized code pertinent to a given input. Traditional profile-guided optimization methods struggle with the input-dependent variability of modern applications, where profiling on different inputs yields divergent application behaviors. To address this, Phaedrus proposes two new approaches: \textit{Application Behavior Synthesis}, a profile-less approach where Large Language Models (LLMs) directly infer dynamic functions based on source code \& static compiler analysis, bypassing the need for traditional profiling, and \textit{Application Profile Generalization}, which uses generative models trained on compressed and augmented \textit{Whole Program Path} (WPP) based function profiles to predict application behavior under unseen inputs. Our experiments show that \textit{Phaedrus} can achieve upto $10^7X$ reduction in WPP function profile sizes, can predict most frequently executed functions that cover upto 85-99\% of the execution time, along with an average of 13.19\% (upto 65\%) reduction in application binary size, and an average of 6.08\% (upto 20\%) performance improvement over the traditional profile-guided optimization, without any execution.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reasoning on a Spectrum: Aligning LLMs to System 1 and System 2 Thinking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12470v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit impressive reasoning abilities, yet their reliance on structured step-by-step processing reveals a critical limitation. In contrast, human cognition fluidly adapts between intuitive, heuristic (System 1) and analytical, deliberative (System 2) reasoning depending on the context. This difference between human cognitive flexibility and LLMs' reliance on a single reasoning style raises a critical question: while human fast heuristic reasoning evolved for its efficiency and adaptability, is a uniform reasoning approach truly optimal for LLMs, or does its inflexibility make them brittle and unreliable when faced with tasks demanding more agile, intuitive responses? To answer these questions, we explicitly align LLMs to these reasoning styles by curating a dataset with valid System 1 and System 2 answers, and evaluate their performance across reasoning benchmarks. Our results reveal an accuracy-efficiency trade-off: System 2-aligned models excel in arithmetic and symbolic reasoning, while System 1-aligned models perform better in commonsense reasoning tasks. To analyze the reasoning spectrum, we interpolated between the two extremes by varying the proportion of alignment data, which resulted in a monotonic change in accuracy. A mechanistic analysis of model responses shows that System 1 models employ more definitive outputs, whereas System 2 models demonstrate greater uncertainty. Building on these findings, we further combine System 1- and System 2-aligned models based on the entropy of their generations, without additional training, and obtain a dynamic model that outperforms across nearly all benchmarks. This work challenges the assumption that step-by-step reasoning is always optimal and highlights the need for adapting reasoning strategies based on task demands.</p></details> |  |
| **[K-ASTRO: Structure-Aware Adaptation of LLMs for Code Vulnerability Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.08067v3)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming software engineering tasks, including code vulnerability detection-a critical area of software security. However, existing methods often rely on resource-intensive models or graph-based techniques, limiting their accessibility and practicality. This paper introduces K-ASTRO, a lightweight Transformer model that combines semantic embeddings from LLMs with structural features of Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) to improve both efficiency and accuracy in code vulnerability detection. Our approach introduces an AST-based augmentation technique inspired by mutation testing, a structure-aware attention mechanism that incorporates augmented AST features, and a joint adaptation pipeline to unify code semantics and syntax. Experimental results on three large-scale datasets, including BigVul, DiverseVul, and PrimeVul-demonstrate state-of-the-art performance while enabling rapid inference on CPUs with minimal training time. By offering a scalable, interpretable, and efficient solution, K-ASTRO bridges the gap between LLM advancements and practical software vulnerability detection, providing open-sourced tools to foster further research.</p></details> |  |
| **[CTIArena: Benchmarking LLM Knowledge and Reasoning Across Heterogeneous Cyber Threat Intelligence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11974v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cyber threat intelligence (CTI) is central to modern cybersecurity, providing critical insights for detecting and mitigating evolving threats. With the natural language understanding and reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), there is increasing interest in applying them to CTI, which calls for benchmarks that can rigorously evaluate their performance. Several early efforts have studied LLMs on some CTI tasks but remain limited: (i) they adopt only closed-book settings, relying on parametric knowledge without leveraging CTI knowledge bases; (ii) they cover only a narrow set of tasks, lacking a systematic view of the CTI landscape; and (iii) they restrict evaluation to single-source analysis, unlike realistic scenarios that require reasoning across multiple sources. To fill these gaps, we present CTIArena, the first benchmark for evaluating LLM performance on heterogeneous, multi-source CTI under knowledge-augmented settings. CTIArena spans three categories, structured, unstructured, and hybrid, further divided into nine tasks that capture the breadth of CTI analysis in modern security operations. We evaluate ten widely used LLMs and find that most struggle in closed-book setups but show noticeable gains when augmented with security-specific knowledge through our designed retrieval-augmented techniques. These findings highlight the limitations of general-purpose LLMs and the need for domain-tailored techniques to fully unlock their potential for CTI.</p></details> | Under peer-review |
| **[Scaling Long-Horizon LLM Agent via Context-Folding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11967v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM) agents are fundamentally constrained by context length on long-horizon tasks. We introduce Context-Folding, a framework that empowers agents to actively manage their working context. An agent can procedurally branch into a sub-trajectory to handle a subtask and then fold it upon completion, collapsing the intermediate steps while retaining a concise summary of the outcome. To make this behavior learnable, we develop an end-to-end reinforcement learning framework FoldGRPO with specific process rewards to encourage effective task decomposition and context management. On complex long-horizon tasks (Deep Research and SWE), our folding agent matches or outperforms the ReAct baselines while using an active context 10$\times$ smaller and significantly outperforms models that rely on summarization-based context management.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can LLMs Express Personality Across Cultures? Introducing CulturalPersonas for Evaluating Trait Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05670v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As LLMs become central to interactive applications, ranging from tutoring to mental health, the ability to express personality in culturally appropriate ways is increasingly important. While recent works have explored personality evaluation of LLMs, they largely overlook the interplay between culture and personality. To address this, we introduce CulturalPersonas, the first large-scale benchmark with human validation for evaluating LLMs' personality expression in culturally grounded, behaviorally rich contexts. Our dataset spans 3,000 scenario-based questions across six diverse countries, designed to elicit personality through everyday scenarios rooted in local values. We evaluate three LLMs, using both multiple-choice and open-ended response formats. Our results show that CulturalPersonas improves alignment with country-specific human personality distributions (over a 20% reduction in Wasserstein distance across models and countries) and elicits more expressive, culturally coherent outputs compared to existing benchmarks. CulturalPersonas surfaces meaningful modulated trait outputs in response to culturally grounded prompts, offering new directions for aligning LLMs to global norms of behavior. By bridging personality expression and cultural nuance, we envision that CulturalPersonas will pave the way for more socially intelligent and globally adaptive LLMs.</p></details> |  |

We present LearnLens, a modular, LLM-based system that generates personalised, curriculum-aligned feedback in science education. LearnLens comprises three components: (1) an error-aware assessment module that captures nuanced reasoning errors; (2) a curriculum-grounded generation module that uses a structured, topic-linked memory chain rather than traditional similarity-based retrieval, improving relevance and reducing noise; and (3) an educator-in-the-loop interface for customisation and oversight. LearnLens addresses key challenges in existing systems, offering scalable, high-quality feedback that empowers both teachers and students.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 |

Current systems rely on static pipeline configurations that struggle to adapt to dynamic workload conditions, leading to substantial inefficiencies. We present FlexPipe, a novel system that dynamically reconfigures pipeline architectures during runtime to address these fundamental limitations. FlexPipe decomposes models into fine-grained stages and intelligently adjusts pipeline granularity based on real-time request pattern analysis, implementing three key innovations: fine-grained model partitioning with preserved computational graph constraints, inflight pipeline refactoring with consistent cache transitions, and topology-aware resource allocation that navigates GPU fragmentation. Comprehensive evaluation on an 82-GPU cluster demonstrates that FlexPipe achieves up to 8.5x better resource efficiency while maintaining 38.3% lower latency compared to state-of-the-art systems, reducing GPU reservation requirements from 75% to 30% of peak capacity.</p></details> | EuroSys 26 |
| **[Robust ML-based Detection of Conventional, LLM-Generated, and Adversarial Phishing Emails Using Advanced Text Preprocessing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11915v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Phishing remains a critical cybersecurity threat, especially with the advent of large language models (LLMs) capable of generating highly convincing malicious content. Unlike earlier phishing attempts which are identifiable by grammatical errors, misspellings, incorrect phrasing, and inconsistent formatting, LLM generated emails are grammatically sound, contextually relevant, and linguistically natural. These advancements make phishing emails increasingly difficult to distinguish from legitimate ones, challenging traditional detection mechanisms. Conventional phishing detection systems often fail when faced with emails crafted by LLMs or manipulated using adversarial perturbation techniques. To address this challenge, we propose a robust phishing email detection system featuring an enhanced text preprocessing pipeline. This pipeline includes spelling correction and word splitting to counteract adversarial modifications and improve detection accuracy. Our approach integrates widely adopted natural language processing (NLP) feature extraction techniques and machine learning algorithms. We evaluate our models on publicly available datasets comprising both phishing and legitimate emails, achieving a detection accuracy of 94.26% and F1-score of 84.39% in model deployment setting. To assess robustness, we further evaluate our models using adversarial phishing samples generated by four attack methods in Python TextAttack framework. Additionally, we evaluate models' performance against phishing emails generated by LLMs including ChatGPT and Llama. Results highlight the resilience of models against evolving AI-powered phishing threats.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM Knowledge is Brittle: Truthfulness Representations Rely on Superficial Resemblance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11905v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For Large Language Models (LLMs) to be reliable, they must learn robust knowledge that can be generally applied in diverse settings -- often unlike those seen during training. Yet, extensive research has shown that LLM performance can be brittle, with models exhibiting excessive sensitivity to trivial input variations. In this work, we explore whether this brittleness is a direct result of unstable internal knowledge representations. To explore this question, we build on previous work showing that LLM representations encode statement truthfulness -- i.e., true, factual statements can be easily separated from false, inaccurate ones. Specifically, we test the robustness of learned knowledge by evaluating representation separability on samples that have undergone superficial transformations to drive them out-of-distribution (OOD), such as typos or reformulations. By applying semantically-preserving perturbations, we study how separability degrades as statements become more OOD, across four LLM families, five evaluation datasets, and three knowledge probing methods. Our results reveal that internal representations of statement truthfulness collapse as the samples' presentations become less similar to those seen during pre-training. While LLMs can often distinguish between true and false statements when they closely resemble the pre-training data, this ability is highly dependent on the statement's exact surface form. These findings offer a possible explanation for brittle benchmark performance: LLMs may learn shallow, non-robust knowledge representations that allow for only limited generalizability. Our work presents a fundamental challenge for the utility of truthfulness probes, and more broadly, calls for further research on improving the robustness of learned knowledge representations.</p></details> |  |
| **[ChatThero: An LLM-Supported Chatbot for Behavior Change and Therapeutic Support in Addiction Recovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20996v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Substance use disorders (SUDs) affect millions of people, and relapses are common, requiring multi-session treatments. Access to care is limited, which contributes to the challenge of recovery support. We present \textbf{ChatThero}, an innovative low-cost, multi-session, stressor-aware, and memory-persistent autonomous \emph{language agent} designed to facilitate long-term behavior change and therapeutic support in addiction recovery. Unlike existing work that mostly finetuned large language models (LLMs) on patient-therapist conversation data, ChatThero was trained in a multi-agent simulated environment that mirrors real therapy. We created anonymized patient profiles from recovery communities (e.g., Reddit). We classify patients as \texttt{easy}, \texttt{medium}, and \texttt{difficult}, three scales representing their resistance to recovery. We created an external environment by introducing stressors (e.g., social determinants of health) to simulate real-world situations. We dynamically inject clinically-grounded therapeutic strategies (motivational interview and cognitive behavioral therapy). Our evaluation, conducted by both human (blinded clinicians) and LLM-as-Judge, shows that ChatThero is superior in empathy and clinical relevance. We show that stressor simulation improves robustness of ChatThero. Explicit stressors increase relapse-like setbacks, matching real-world patterns. We evaluate ChatThero with behavioral change metrics. On a 1--5 scale, ChatThero raises \texttt{motivation} by $+1.71$ points (from $2.39$ to $4.10$) and \texttt{confidence} by $+1.67$ points (from $1.52$ to $3.19$), substantially outperforming GPT-5. On \texttt{difficult} patients, ChatThero reaches the success milestone with $26\%$ fewer turns than GPT-5.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Consensus: Mitigating the Agreeableness Bias in LLM Judge Evaluations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11822v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>New Large Language Models (LLMs) become available every few weeks, and modern application developers confronted with the unenviable task of having to decide if they should switch to a new model. While human evaluation remains the gold standard, it is costly and unscalable. The state-of-the-art approach is to use LLMs as evaluators ( LLM-as-a-judge), but this suffers from a critical flaw: LLMs exhibit a strong positive bias. We provide empirical evidence showing that while LLMs can identify valid outputs with high accuracy (i.e., True Positive Rate 96%), they are remarkably poor at identifying invalid ones (i.e., True Negative Rate <25%). This systematic bias, coupled with class imbalance, often leads to inflated reliability scores. While ensemble-based methods like majority voting can help, we show that they are not good enough. We introduce an optimal minority-veto strategy that is resilient to missing data and mitigates this bias to a large extent. For scenarios requiring even higher precision, we propose a novel regression-based framework that directly models the validator bias using a small set of human-annotated ground truth data. On a challenging code feedback task over 366 high-school Python programs, our regression approach reduces the maximum absolute error to just 1.2%, achieving a 2x improvement over the best-performing ensemble of 14 state-of-the-art LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Task-Aware Reduction for Scalable LLM-Database Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11813v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to data-intensive workflows, from database querying to developer observability. Yet the effectiveness of these systems is constrained by the volume, verbosity, and noise of real-world text-rich data such as logs, telemetry, and monitoring streams. Feeding such data directly into LLMs is costly, environmentally unsustainable, and often misaligned with task objectives. Parallel efforts in LLM efficiency have focused on model- or architecture-level optimizations, but the challenge of reducing upstream input verbosity remains underexplored. In this paper, we argue for treating the token budget of an LLM as an attention budget and elevating task-aware text reduction as a first-class design principle for language -- data systems. We position input-side reduction not as compression, but as attention allocation: prioritizing information most relevant to downstream tasks. We outline open research challenges for building benchmarks, designing adaptive reduction pipelines, and integrating token-budget--aware preprocessing into database and retrieval systems. Our vision is to channel scarce attention resources toward meaningful signals in noisy, data-intensive workflows, enabling scalable, accurate, and sustainable LLM--data integration.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

| **[QeRL: Beyond Efficiency -- Quantization-enhanced Reinforcement Learning for LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11696v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose QeRL, a Quantization-enhanced Reinforcement Learning framework for large language models (LLMs). While RL is essential for LLMs' reasoning capabilities, it is resource-intensive, requiring substantial GPU memory and long rollout durations. QeRL addresses these issues by combining NVFP4 quantization with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), accelerating rollout phase of RL while reducing memory overhead. Beyond efficiency, our findings show that quantization noise increases policy entropy, enhancing exploration, and enabling the discovery of better strategies during RL. To further optimize exploration, QeRL introduces an Adaptive Quantization Noise (AQN) mechanism, which dynamically adjusts noise during training. Experiments demonstrate that QeRL delivers over 1.5 times speedup in the rollout phase. Moreover, this is the first framework to enable RL training of a 32B LLM on a single H100 80GB GPU, while delivering overall speedups for RL training. It also achieves faster reward growth and higher final accuracy than 16-bit LoRA and QLoRA, while matching the performance of full-parameter fine-tuning on mathematical benchmarks such as GSM8K (90.8%) and MATH 500 (77.4%) in the 7B model. These results establish QeRL as an efficient and effective framework for RL training in LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is available at https://github.com/NVlabs/QeRL</p></details> |

To address these gaps, we introduce Agent Market Arena (AMA), the first lifelong, real-time benchmark for evaluating LLM-based trading agents across multiple markets. AMA integrates verified trading data, expert-checked news, and diverse agent architectures within a unified trading framework, enabling fair and continuous comparison under real conditions. It implements four agents, including InvestorAgent as a single-agent baseline, TradeAgent and HedgeFundAgent with different risk styles, and DeepFundAgent with memory-based reasoning, and evaluates them across GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, Claude-3.5-haiku, Claude-sonnet-4, and Gemini-2.0-flash. Live experiments on both cryptocurrency and stock markets demonstrate that agent frameworks display markedly distinct behavioral patterns, spanning from aggressive risk-taking to conservative decision-making, whereas model backbones contribute less to outcome variation. AMA thus establishes a foundation for rigorous, reproducible, and continuously evolving evaluation of financial reasoning and trading intelligence in LLM-based agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[Let's Reason Formally: Natural-Formal Hybrid Reasoning Enhances LLM's Math Capability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23703v4)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enhancing the mathematical reasoning capabilities of LLMs has garnered significant attention in both the mathematical and computer science communities. Recent works have made substantial progress in both Natural Language (NL) reasoning and Formal Language (FL) reasoning by leveraging the potential of pure Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods on base models. However, RL approaches struggle to impart new capabilities not presented in the base model, highlighting the need to integrate more knowledge like FL into NL math reasoning effectively. Yet, this integration is challenging due to inherent disparities in problem structure and reasoning format between NL and FL. To address these challenges, we introduce **NL-FL HybridReasoning (NFL-HR)**, an end-to-end framework designed to incorporate the FL expert into NL math problem-solving. To bridge the NL and FL input format gap, we propose the NL-FL Problem Alignment method, which reformulates the Question-Answering (QA) problems in NL as existence theorems in FL. Subsequently, the Mixed Problem Input technique we provide enables the FL reasoner to handle both QA and existence problems concurrently. Lastly, we mitigate the NL and FL output format gap in reasoning through an LLM-based Answer Extraction mechanism. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the NFL-HR framework achieves **89.80**% and **84.34%** accuracy rates on the MATH-500 and the AMC benchmarks, surpassing the NL baseline by **4.60%** and **4.82%**, respectively. Notably, some problems resolved by our framework remain unsolved by the NL baseline model even under a larger number of trials.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-Oriented Token-Adaptive Knowledge Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11615v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge distillation (KD) is a key technique for compressing large-scale language models (LLMs), yet prevailing logit-based methods typically employ static strategies that are misaligned with the dynamic learning process of student models. These methods typically treat all tokens indiscriminately and apply a single, fixed temperature, resulting in suboptimal knowledge transfer. To address these limitations, we propose LLM-Oriented Token-Adaptive Knowledge Distillation (AdaKD), a novel framework that adapts the distillation process to the real-time learning state of each token. AdaKD consists of two synergistic modules driven by a unified token difficulty metric. First, our Loss-Driven Adaptive Token Focusing (LATF) module dynamically adjusts the distillation focus by monitoring the student's learning stability, concentrating computational resources on the most valuable tokens at each training phase. Second, we introduce Inverse Difficulty Temperature Scaling (IDTS), a counterintuitive yet effective token-level temperature strategy. It employs low temperatures for difficult tokens for targeted error correction, and high temperatures for easy tokens to encourage students to learn from the teacher's complete and smooth output distribution, thereby enhancing generalization. As a plug-and-play framework, AdaKD can consistently improve the performance of various distillation methods on multiple model architectures and benchmarks.</p></details> | 15 pages, 4 figures |

As requirements grow, these documents expand rapidly, causing high computational overhead. This motivates developing internalization methods that embed policy documents into model priors while preserving performance. Prior prompt compression work targets generic prompts, but agentic policy documents span multiple complexity levels and require deeper reasoning, making internalization harder. We introduce CC-Gen, an agentic benchmark generator with Controllable Complexity across four levels, enabling systematic evaluation of agents' ability to handle complexity and offering a unified framework for assessing policy internalization. Our analysis shows that complex policy specifications governing workflows pose major reasoning challenges. Supporting internalization with gold user agent interaction trajectories containing chain-of-thought (CoT) annotations via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is data-intensive and degrades sharply as policy complexity increases. To mitigate data and reasoning burdens, we propose Category-Aware Policy Continued Pretraining (CAP-CPT). Our automated pipeline parses policy documents to extract key specifications, grouping them into factual, behavioral, and conditional categories, and isolating complex conditions that drive workflow complexity. This guides targeted data synthesis and enables agents to internalize policy information through an autoregressive pretraining loss. Experiments show CAP-CPT improves SFT baselines in all settings, with up to 41% and 22% gains on Qwen-3-32B, achieving 97.3% prompt length reduction on CC-Gen and further enhancing tau-Bench with minimal SFT data.</p></details> | 42 pages |

In this work, we introduce the first framework and benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs in realistic, multicultural conversational settings. Grounded in sociocultural theory, our framework formalizes how linguistic style - a key element of cultural communication - is shaped by situational, relational, and cultural context. We construct a benchmark dataset based on this framework, annotated by culturally diverse raters, and propose a new set of desiderata for cross-cultural evaluation in NLP: conversational framing, stylistic sensitivity, and subjective correctness. We evaluate today's top LLMs on our benchmark and show that these models struggle with cultural adaptation in a conversational setting.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at the 4th HCI + NLP Workshop @ EMNLP</p></details> |

However, existing LLM agents largely overlook the functional role of emotions in such negotiations, instead generating passive, preference-driven emotional responses that make them vulnerable to manipulation and strategic exploitation by adversarial counterparts. To address this gap, we present EvoEmo, an evolutionary reinforcement learning framework that optimizes dynamic emotional expression in negotiations. EvoEmo models emotional state transitions as a Markov Decision Process and employs population-based genetic optimization to evolve high-reward emotion policies across diverse negotiation scenarios. We further propose an evaluation framework with two baselines -- vanilla strategies and fixed-emotion strategies -- for benchmarking emotion-aware negotiation. Extensive experiments and ablation studies show that EvoEmo consistently outperforms both baselines, achieving higher success rates, higher efficiency, and increased buyer savings. This findings highlight the importance of adaptive emotional expression in enabling more effective LLM agents for multi-turn negotiation.</p></details> |  |

This work introduces a novel, systematic decomposition framework that we call Analysis of CONstraint-Induced Complexity (ACONIC), which models the task as a constraint problem and leveraging formal complexity measures to guide decomposition. On combinatorial (SATBench) and LLM database querying tasks (Spider), we find that by decomposing the tasks following the measure of complexity, agent can perform considerably better (10-40 percentage point).</p></details> |  |

Since the recent emergence of AI enterprise AI assistants enhancing business productivity, safeguarding private data and compliance is now a priority. With the implementation of AI assistants across the enterprise, the zero data retention can be achieved by implementing zero data retention policies by Large Language Model businesses like Open AI and Anthropic and Meta. In this work, we explore zero data retention policies for the Enterprise apps of large language models (LLMs). Our key contribution is defining the architectural, compliance, and usability trade-offs of such systems in parallel. In this research work, we examine the development of commercial AI assistants with two industry leaders and market titans in this arena - Salesforce and Microsoft. Both of these companies used distinct technical architecture to support zero data retention policies. Salesforce AgentForce and Microsoft Copilot are among the leading AI assistants providing much-needed push to business productivity in customer care. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the technical architecture and deployment of zero data retention policy by consuming applications as well as big language models service providers like Open Ai, Anthropic, and Meta.</p></details> |  |
| **[Invisible Languages of the LLM Universe](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11557v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models are trained on massive multilingual corpora, yet this abundance masks a profound crisis: of the world's 7,613 living languages, approximately 2,000 languages with millions of speakers remain effectively invisible in digital ecosystems. We propose a critical framework connecting empirical measurements of language vitality (real world demographic strength) and digitality (online presence) with postcolonial theory and epistemic injustice to explain why linguistic inequality in AI systems is not incidental but structural. Analyzing data across all documented human languages, we identify four categories: Strongholds (33%, high vitality and digitality), Digital Echoes (6%, high digitality despite declining vitality), Fading Voices (36%, low on both dimensions), and critically, Invisible Giants (27%, high vitality but near-zero digitality) - languages spoken by millions yet absent from the LLM universe. We demonstrate that these patterns reflect continuities from colonial-era linguistic hierarchies to contemporary AI development, constituting what we term digital epistemic injustice. Our analysis reveals that English dominance in AI is not a technical necessity but an artifact of power structures that systematically exclude marginalized linguistic knowledge. We conclude with implications for decolonizing language technology and democratizing access to AI benefits.</p></details> |  |

One fundamental aspect of effective learning is relevant, immediate, and constructive feedback to students. Providing constructive feedback to large cohorts in academia is an ongoing challenge. Therefore, academics are moving towards automated assessment to provide immediate feedback. However, current approaches are often limited in scope, offering simplistic responses that do not provide students with personalized feedback to guide them toward improvements. This paper addresses this limitation by investigating the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in processing students assessments with predefined rubrics and marking criteria to generate personalized feedback for in-depth learning. We aim to leverage the power of existing LLMs for Marking Assessments, Tracking, and Evaluation (LLM-MATE) with personalized feedback to enhance students learning. To evaluate the performance of LLM-MATE, we consider the Software Architecture (SA) module as a case study. The LLM-MATE approach can help module leaders overcome assessment challenges with large cohorts. Also, it helps students improve their learning by obtaining personalized feedback in a timely manner. Additionally, the proposed approach will facilitate the establishment of ground truth for automating the generation of students assessment feedback using the ChatGPT API, thereby reducing the overhead associated with large cohort assessments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Does Reinforcement Learning Really Incentivize Reasoning Capacity in LLMs Beyond the Base Model?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13837v3)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently demonstrated notable success in enhancing the reasoning performance of large language models (LLMs), particularly on mathematics and programming tasks. Similar to how traditional RL helps agents explore and learn new strategies, RLVR is believed to enable LLMs to continuously self-improve, thus acquiring novel reasoning abilities beyond those of the corresponding base models. In this study we critically examine the current state of RLVR by systematically probing the reasoning capability boundaries of RLVR-trained LLMs across various model families, RL algorithms, and math, coding, and visual reasoning benchmarks, using pass@k at large k values as the evaluation metric. Surprisingly, we find that the current training setup does not elicit fundamentally new reasoning patterns. While RLVR-trained models outperform their base models at small k (e.g., k = 1), the base models achieve a higher pass@k score when k is large. Coverage and perplexity analyses show that the observed reasoning abilities originate from and are bounded by the base model. Treating the base model as an upper bound, our quantitative analysis shows that six popular RLVR algorithms perform similarly and remain far from optimal in leveraging the potential of the base model. By contrast, we find that distillation can introduce new reasoning patterns from the teacher and genuinely expand the model's reasoning capabilities. Overall, our findings suggest that current RLVR methods have not yet realized the potential of RL to elicit truly novel reasoning abilities in LLMs. This highlights the need for improved RL paradigms, such as continual scaling and multi-turn agent-environment interaction, to unlock this potential.</p></details> | 30 pages, 27 figures |

Large language models (LLMs) offer an alternative by simulating synthetic consumers, but produce unrealistic response distributions when asked directly for numerical ratings. We present semantic similarity rating (SSR), a method that elicits textual responses from LLMs and maps these to Likert distributions using embedding similarity to reference statements. Testing on an extensive dataset comprising 57 personal care product surveys conducted by a leading corporation in that market (9,300 human responses), SSR achieves 90% of human test-retest reliability while maintaining realistic response distributions (KS similarity > 0.85). Additionally, these synthetic respondents provide rich qualitative feedback explaining their ratings. This framework enables scalable consumer research simulations while preserving traditional survey metrics and interpretability.</p></details> | 28 pages, 35 figures |

We present ReLook, an agentic, vision-grounded reinforcement learning framework that empowers an agent to close a robust generate--diagnose--refine loop by invoking a multimodal LLM (MLLM) as a tool. During training, the agent uses the MLLM-in-the-loop both as a visual critic--scoring code with screenshots--and as a source of actionable, vision-grounded feedback; a strict zero-reward rule for invalid renders anchors renderability and prevents reward hacking. To prevent behavioral collapse, we introduce Forced Optimization, a strict acceptance rule that admits only improving revisions, yielding monotonically better trajectories. At inference, we decouple the critic and run a lightweight, critic-free self-edit cycle, keeping latency comparable to base decoding while retaining most of the gains. Across three widely used benchmarks, ReLook consistently outperforms strong baselines in vision-grounded front-end code generation, highlighting the benefits of agentic perception, visual rewards, and training-inference decoupling.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating LLMs for Demographic-Targeted Social Bias Detection: A Comprehensive Benchmark Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04641v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale web-scraped text corpora used to train general-purpose AI models often contain harmful demographic-targeted social biases, creating a regulatory need for data auditing and developing scalable bias-detection methods. Although prior work has investigated biases in text datasets and related detection methods, these studies remain narrow in scope. They typically focus on a single content type (e.g., hate speech), cover limited demographic axes, overlook biases affecting multiple demographics simultaneously, and analyze limited techniques. Consequently, practitioners lack a holistic understanding of the strengths and limitations of recent large language models (LLMs) for automated bias detection. In this study, we present a comprehensive evaluation framework aimed at English texts to assess the ability of LLMs in detecting demographic-targeted social biases. To align with regulatory requirements, we frame bias detection as a multi-label task using a demographic-focused taxonomy. We then conduct a systematic evaluation with models across scales and techniques, including prompting, in-context learning, and fine-tuning. Using twelve datasets spanning diverse content types and demographics, our study demonstrates the promise of fine-tuned smaller models for scalable detection. However, our analyses also expose persistent gaps across demographic axes and multi-demographic targeted biases, underscoring the need for more effective and scalable auditing frameworks.</p></details> | 18 pages |
| **[LADM: Long-context Training Data Selection with Attention-based Dependency Measurement for LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02502v3)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-context modeling has drawn more and more attention in the area of Large Language Models (LLMs). Continual training with long-context data becomes the de-facto method to equip LLMs with the ability to process long inputs. However, it still remains an open challenge to measure the quality of long-context training data. To address this issue, we propose a Long-context data selection framework with Attention-based Dependency Measurement (LADM), which can efficiently identify high-quality long-context data from a large-scale, multi-domain pre-training corpus. LADM leverages the retrieval capabilities of the attention mechanism to capture contextual dependencies, ensuring a comprehensive quality measurement of long-context data. Experimental results show that our LADM framework significantly boosts the performance of LLMs on multiple long-context tasks with only 1B tokens for continual training.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACL 2...</summary><p>ACL 2025, our code is available at https://github.com/ZNLP/LADM</p></details> |
| **[From <Answer> to <Think>: Multidimensional Supervision of Reasoning Process for LLM Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11457v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Improving the multi-step reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) is a critical yet challenging task. The dominant paradigm, outcome-supervised reinforcement learning (RLVR), rewards only correct final answers, often propagating flawed reasoning and suffering from sparse reward signals. While process-level reward models (PRMs) provide denser, step-by-step feedback, they lack generalizability and interpretability, requiring task-specific segmentation of the reasoning process. To this end, we propose the Dimension-level Reward Model (DRM), a new supervision framework that bridges the gap between these two approaches. DRM evaluates the quality of a reasoning process along three fundamental, complementary, and interpretable dimensions: Confidence for uncertainty calibration, Relevance for semantic alignment, and Coherence for logical consistency. Together, these dimensions capture aspects beyond final answer correctness and enable interpretable assessment without requiring ground truth answers. Experimental results show that DRM provides effective supervision signals, guides the optimization of LLMs and enhances their reasoning ability. In particular, DRM-supervised training achieves consistent gains on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution open-domain tasks, including mathematics, question answering, code execution, and puzzles. Our findings demonstrate that multidimensional supervision of the reasoning process can improve the generalized reasoning ability of LLMs beyond the training distribution.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evolving LLMs' Self-Refinement Capability via Synergistic Training-Inference Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05605v4)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-Refinement refers to a model's ability to revise its own responses to produce improved outputs. This capability can also serve as a fundamental mechanism for Self-Improvement, for example, by reconstructing datasets with refined results to enhance intrinsic model performance. However, our comprehensive experiments reveal that large language models (LLMs) show no clear evidence of inherent Self-Refinement and may even experience response quality degradation after Self-Refinement. To address this issue, we propose EVOLVE, a simple and effective framework for eliciting and tracking the evolution of Self-Refinement through iterative training. We first explore optimization methods during training to activate the model's Self-Refinement capability. Then, at inference, we investigate various generation strategies to further enhance and utilize Self-Refinement while supplying the necessary data for training. Through synergistic optimization of training and inference stages, we continually evolve the model's Self-Refinement ability, enabling it to better refine its own responses. Moreover, we demonstrate the potential of leveraging Self-Refinement to achieve broader Self-Improvement of intrinsic model abilities. Experiments show that the evolved Self-Refinement ability enables the Llama-3.1-8B base model to surpass GPT-4o, achieving 62.3% length-controlled and 63.3% raw win rates on AlpacaEval 2, and 50.3% on Arena-Hard. It also generalizes effectively to out-of-domain reasoning tasks, improving performance on mathematical reasoning benchmarks such as GSM8K and MATH.</p></details> |  |

Personality and Demographic Style in LLM-Generated Content](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11434v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative large language models (LLMs) have become central to everyday life, producing human-like text across diverse domains. A growing body of research investigates whether these models also exhibit personality- and demographic-like characteristics in their language. In this work, we introduce a novel, data-driven methodology for assessing LLM personality without relying on self-report questionnaires, applying instead automatic personality and gender classifiers to model replies on open-ended questions collected from Reddit. Comparing six widely used models to human-authored responses, we find that LLMs systematically express higher Agreeableness and lower Neuroticism, reflecting cooperative and stable conversational tendencies. Gendered language patterns in model text broadly resemble those of human writers, though with reduced variation, echoing prior findings on automated agents. We contribute a new dataset of human and model responses, along with large-scale comparative analyses, shedding new light on the topic of personality and demographic patterns of generative AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>ECAI2...</summary><p>ECAI2025 (Identity-Aware AI workshop)</p></details> |

However, our analysis of 30.8K health-related notes reveals significant latency, with a median delay of 17.6 hours before the first note receives a helpfulness status. To improve responsiveness during real-world misinformation surges, we propose CrowdNotes+, a unified framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to augment Community Notes for faster and more reliable health misinformation governance. CrowdNotes+ integrates two complementary modes: (1) evidence-grounded note augmentation and (2) utility-guided note automation, along with a hierarchical three-step evaluation that progressively assesses relevance, correctness, and helpfulness. We instantiate the framework through HealthNotes, a benchmark of 1.2K helpfulness-annotated health notes paired with a fine-tuned helpfulness judge. Experiments on fifteen LLMs reveal an overlooked loophole in current helpfulness evaluation, where stylistic fluency is mistaken for factual accuracy, and demonstrate that our hierarchical evaluation and LLM-augmented generation jointly enhance factual precision and evidence utility. These results point toward a hybrid human-AI governance model that improves both the rigor and timeliness of crowd-sourced fact-checking.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uncertainty-Aware, Risk-Adaptive Access Control for Agentic Systems using an LLM-Judged TBAC Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11414v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The proliferation of autonomous AI agents within enterprise environments introduces a critical security challenge: managing access control for emergent, novel tasks for which no predefined policies exist. This paper introduces an advanced security framework that extends the Task-Based Access Control (TBAC) model by using a Large Language Model (LLM) as an autonomous, risk-aware judge. This model makes access control decisions not only based on an agent's intent but also by explicitly considering the inherent \textbf{risk associated with target resources} and the LLM's own \textbf{model uncertainty} in its decision-making process. When an agent proposes a novel task, the LLM judge synthesizes a just-in-time policy while also computing a composite risk score for the task and an uncertainty estimate for its own reasoning. High-risk or high-uncertainty requests trigger more stringent controls, such as requiring human approval. This dual consideration of external risk and internal confidence allows the model to enforce a more robust and adaptive version of the principle of least privilege, paving the way for safer and more trustworthy autonomous systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging LLMs for Semi-Automatic Corpus Filtration in Systematic Literature Reviews](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11409v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The creation of systematic literature reviews (SLR) is critical for analyzing the landscape of a research field and guiding future research directions. However, retrieving and filtering the literature corpus for an SLR is highly time-consuming and requires extensive manual effort, as keyword-based searches in digital libraries often return numerous irrelevant publications. In this work, we propose a pipeline leveraging multiple large language models (LLMs), classifying papers based on descriptive prompts and deciding jointly using a consensus scheme. The entire process is human-supervised and interactively controlled via our open-source visual analytics web interface, LLMSurver, which enables real-time inspection and modification of model outputs. We evaluate our approach using ground-truth data from a recent SLR comprising over 8,000 candidate papers, benchmarking both open and commercial state-of-the-art LLMs from mid-2024 and fall 2025. Results demonstrate that our pipeline significantly reduces manual effort while achieving lower error rates than single human annotators. Furthermore, modern open-source models prove sufficient for this task, making the method accessible and cost-effective. Overall, our work demonstrates how responsible human-AI collaboration can accelerate and enhance systematic literature reviews within academic workflows.</p></details> |  |

However, most studies reduce the game to LLM-based self-play, yielding templated utterances and anecdotal cases that overlook the richness of social gameplay. Evaluation further relies on coarse metrics such as survival time or subjective scoring due to the lack of quality reference data. To address these gaps, we curate a high-quality, human-verified multimodal Werewolf dataset containing over 100 hours of video, 32.4M utterance tokens, and 15 rule variants. Based on this dataset, we propose a novel strategy-alignment evaluation that leverages the winning faction's strategies as ground truth in two stages: 1) Speech evaluation, formulated as multiple-choice-style tasks that assess whether the model can adopt appropriate stances across five dimensions of social ability; and 2) Decision evaluation, which assesses the model's voting choices and opponent-role inferences. This framework enables a fine-grained evaluation of models' linguistic and reasoning capabilities, while capturing their ability to generate strategically coherent gameplay. Our experiments show that state-of-the-art LLMs show diverse performance, with roughly half remain below 0.50, revealing clear gaps in deception and counterfactual reasoning. We hope our dataset further inspires research on language, reasoning, and strategy in multi-agent interaction.</p></details> | 34 pages, 32figures |
| **[From $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ to $f(g(x))$: LLMs Learn New Skills in RL by Composing Old Ones](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25123v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Does RL teach LLMs genuinely new skills, or does it merely activate existing ones? This question lies at the core of ongoing debates about the role of RL in LLM post-training. On one side, strong empirical results can be achieved with RL even without preceding supervised finetuning; on the other, critics argue that RL contributes little beyond reweighting existing reasoning strategies. This work provides concrete evidence that LLMs can acquire genuinely new skills during RL by composing existing ones, mirroring one of the central mechanisms by which humans acquire new cognitive skills. To mitigate data contamination and other confounding factors, and to allow precise control over task complexity, we develop a synthetic framework for our investigation. Specifically, we define a skill as the ability to infer the output of a string transformation function f(x) given x. When an LLM has already learned f and g prior to RL, our experiments reveal that RL enables it to learn unseen compositions of them h(x)=g(f(x)). Further, this compositional ability generalizes to more difficult problems such as compositions of >2 functions unseen during RL training. Surprisingly, our experiments show that compositional skill acquired on a source task transfers to a different target task. This transfer happens even without compositional training on the target, requiring only prior knowledge of the target's atomic skills. Our qualitative analysis shows that RL fundamentally changes the reasoning behaviors of the models. In contrast, next-token training with the same data yields none of these findings. Our systematic experiments provide fresh insights into LLM learning, suggesting the value of first building base models with basic skills, then using RL to incentivize advanced, generalizable skills for complex problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-Specific Utility: A New Perspective for Retrieval-Augmented Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11358v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by incorporating external knowledge. While traditional retrieval focuses on relevance, RAG's effectiveness depends on the utility of retrieved passages, i.e., the usefulness in facilitating the generation of an accurate and comprehensive answer. Existing studies often treat utility as a generic attribute, ignoring the fact that different LLMs may benefit differently from the same passage due to variations in internal knowledge and comprehension ability. In this work, we introduce and systematically investigate the notion of LLM-specific utility. Through large-scale experiments across multiple datasets and LLMs, we demonstrate that human-annotated passages are not optimal for LLMs and that ground-truth utilitarian passages are not transferable across different LLMs. These findings highlight the necessity of adopting the LLM-specific utility in RAG research. Our findings indicate that some human-annotated passages are not ground-truth utilitarian passages for specific LLMs, partially due to the varying readability of queries and passages for LLMs, a tendency for which perplexity is a key metric. Based on these findings, we propose a benchmarking procedure for LLM-specific utility judgments. We evaluate existing utility judgment methods on six datasets and find that while verbalized methods using pseudo-answers perform robustly, LLMs struggle to assess utility effectively-failing to reject all passages for known queries and to select truly useful ones for unknown queries.</p></details> | 13 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Downgrade to Upgrade: Optimizer Simplification Enhances Robustness in LLM Unlearning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00761v3)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM) unlearning aims to surgically remove the influence of undesired data or knowledge from an existing model while preserving its utility on unrelated tasks. This paradigm has shown promise in addressing privacy and safety concerns. However, recent findings reveal that unlearning effects are often fragile: post-unlearning manipulations such as weight quantization or fine-tuning can quickly neutralize the intended forgetting. Prior efforts to improve robustness primarily reformulate unlearning objectives by explicitly assuming the role of vulnerability sources. In this work, we take a different perspective by investigating the role of the optimizer, independent of unlearning objectives and formulations, in shaping unlearning robustness. We show that the 'grade' of the optimizer, defined by the level of information it exploits, ranging from zeroth-order (gradient-free) to first-order (gradient-based) to second-order (Hessian-based), is tightly linked to the resilience of unlearning. Surprisingly, we find that downgrading the optimizer, such as using zeroth-order methods or compressed-gradient variants (e.g., gradient sign-based optimizers), often leads to stronger robustness. While these optimizers produce noisier and less precise updates, they encourage convergence to harder-to-disturb basins in the loss landscape, thereby resisting post-training perturbations. By connecting zeroth-order methods with randomized smoothing, we further highlight their natural advantage for robust unlearning. Motivated by these insights, we propose a hybrid optimizer that combines first-order and zeroth-order updates, preserving unlearning efficacy while enhancing robustness. Extensive experiments on the MUSE and WMDP benchmarks, across multiple LLM unlearning algorithms, validate that our approach achieves more resilient forgetting without sacrificing unlearning quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient LLM Inference over Heterogeneous Edge Networks with Speculative Decoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11331v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM) inference at the network edge is a promising serving paradigm that leverages distributed edge resources to run inference near users and enhance privacy. Existing edge-based LLM inference systems typically adopt autoregressive decoding (AD), which only generates one token per forward pass. This iterative process, compounded by the limited computational resources of edge nodes, results in high serving latency and constrains the system's ability to support multiple users under growing demands.To address these challenges, we propose a speculative decoding (SD)-based LLM serving framework that deploys small and large models across heterogeneous edge nodes to collaboratively deliver inference services. Specifically, the small model rapidly generates draft tokens that the large model verifies in parallel, enabling multi-token generation per forward pass and thus reducing serving latency. To improve resource utilization of edge nodes, we incorporate pipeline parallelism to overlap drafting and verification across multiple inference tasks. Based on this framework, we analyze and derive a comprehensive latency model incorporating both communication and inference latency. Then, we formulate a joint optimization problem for speculation length, task batching, and wireless communication resource allocation to minimize total serving latency. To address this problem, we derive the closed-form solutions for wireless communication resource allocation, and develop a dynamic programming algorithm for joint batching and speculation control strategies. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves lower serving latency compared to AD-based serving systems. In addition,the proposed joint optimization method delivers up to 44.9% latency reduction compared to benchmark schemes.</p></details> |  |

Emotion Circuits Discovery and Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11328v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the demand for emotional intelligence in large language models (LLMs) grows, a key challenge lies in understanding the internal mechanisms that give rise to emotional expression and in controlling emotions in generated text. This study addresses three core questions: (1) Do LLMs contain context-agnostic mechanisms shaping emotional expression? (2) What form do these mechanisms take? (3) Can they be harnessed for universal emotion control? We first construct a controlled dataset, SEV (Scenario-Event with Valence), to elicit comparable internal states across emotions. Subsequently, we extract context-agnostic emotion directions that reveal consistent, cross-context encoding of emotion (Q1). We identify neurons and attention heads that locally implement emotional computation through analytical decomposition and causal analysis, and validate their causal roles via ablation and enhancement interventions. Next, we quantify each sublayer's causal influence on the model's final emotion representation and integrate the identified local components into coherent global emotion circuits that drive emotional expression (Q2). Directly modulating these circuits achieves 99.65% emotion-expression accuracy on the test set, surpassing prompting- and steering-based methods (Q3). To our knowledge, this is the first systematic study to uncover and validate emotion circuits in LLMs, offering new insights into interpretability and controllable emotional intelligence.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 8 figures, 8 tables.

Our framework standardizes the pipeline from prompting and generation to normalization and alignment with ontology nodes. To evaluate outputs, we introduce two metrics: a semantic F1-score that uses optimal embedding-based matching to assess content accuracy, and a hierarchy-aware F1-score that credits structurally correct placements to assess granularity. We conduct experiments on ROME-ESCO-DecompSkill, a curated subset of parents, comparing two prompting strategies: zero-shot and leakage-safe few-shot with exemplars. Across diverse LLMs, zero-shot offers a strong baseline, while few-shot consistently stabilizes phrasing and granularity and improves hierarchy-aware alignment. A latency analysis further shows that exemplar-guided prompts are competitive - and sometimes faster - than unguided zero-shot due to more schema-compliant completions. Together, the framework, benchmark, and metrics provide a reproducible foundation for developing ontology-faithful skill decomposition systems.</p></details> |  |

While concerning, these findings were limited to finetuning and activation steering, leaving out in-context learning (ICL). We therefore ask: does EM emerge in ICL? We find that it does: across three datasets, three frontier models produce broadly misaligned responses at rates between 2% and 17% given 64 narrow in-context examples, and up to 58% with 256 examples. We also examine mechanisms of EM by eliciting step-by-step reasoning (while leaving in-context examples unchanged). Manual analysis of the resulting chain-of-thought shows that 67.5% of misaligned traces explicitly rationalize harmful outputs by adopting a reckless or dangerous ''persona'', echoing prior results on finetuning-induced EM.</p></details> |  |
| **[Vision-LLMs for Spatiotemporal Traffic Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11282v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate spatiotemporal traffic forecasting is a critical prerequisite for proactive resource management in dense urban mobile networks. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in time series analysis, they inherently struggle to model the complex spatial dependencies of grid-based traffic data. Effectively extending LLMs to this domain is challenging, as representing the vast amount of information from dense geographical grids can be inefficient and overwhelm the model's context. To address these challenges, we propose ST-Vision-LLM, a novel framework that reframes spatiotemporal forecasting as a vision-language fusion problem. Our approach leverages a Vision-LLM visual encoder to process historical global traffic matrices as image sequences, providing the model with a comprehensive global view to inform cell-level predictions. To overcome the inefficiency of LLMs in handling numerical data, we introduce an efficient encoding scheme that represents floating-point values as single tokens via a specialized vocabulary, coupled with a two-stage numerical alignment fine-tuning process. The model is first trained with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and then further optimized for predictive accuracy using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a memory-efficient reinforcement learning method. Evaluations on real-world mobile traffic datasets demonstrate that ST-Vision-LLM outperforms existing methods by 15.6% in long-term prediction accuracy and exceeds the second-best baseline by over 30.04% in cross-domain few-shot scenarios. Our extensive experiments validate the model's strong generalization capabilities across various data-scarce environments.</p></details> |  |

The efficacy of these judges depends on their chain-of-thought reasoning, creating a critical need for methods that can effectively optimize this reasoning process. In this work, we introduce J1, a reinforcement learning framework for teaching LLM judges to think before making decisions. Our core contribution lies in converting all judgment tasks for non-verifiable and verifiable prompts into a unified format with verifiable rewards, enabling direct optimization of evaluation quality while mitigating positional bias. We then use RL to train thinking-judges at scales of 8B, 32B, and 70B and show that they obtain state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks. In particular, J1-Qwen-32B, our multitasked pointwise and pairwise judge also outperforms o1-mini, o3, and a much larger 671B DeepSeek-R1 on some benchmarks, while only training on synthetic data. Through comprehensive ablations of pairwise, pointwise, and multitask J1 variants, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across seed prompts, reward strategies, and training recipes. Qualitative analysis reveals that J1 develops systematic evaluation strategies, including dynamic criteria generation, reference answer creation, iterative self-correction of initial assessments, and feedback generation for low-quality responses.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 13 tables, 14 figures</p></details> |

A key bottleneck is evaluating intermediate reasoning steps to guide generation without costly human annotations. To address this, we first introduce a novel Process Reward Model (PRM) trained automatically using Monte Carlo Tree Search coupled with a similarity-based data augmentation technique, effectively capturing step-level reasoning quality. Leveraging this PRM, we then adapt Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) to operate at the reasoning step level. Unlike traditional reinforcement learning focused on maximizing a single reward, GFlowNets naturally sample diverse, high-quality solutions proportional to their rewards, as measured by our PRM. Empirical evaluation shows strong improvements in both accuracy and solution diversity on challenging mathematical benchmarks (e.g., +2.59% absolute accuracy on MATH Level 5 for Llama3.2-3B), with effective generalization to unseen datasets (+9.4\% absolute on SAT MATH). Furthermore, we benchmark our PRM against existing open-source reward models, demonstrating superior alignment with reasoning quality and more consistent guidance for downstream generation. Our work demonstrates the potential of PRM-guided, step-level GFlowNets for developing more robust and versatile mathematical reasoning in LLMs.</p></details> |  |

| **[Phaedrus: Predicting Dynamic Application Behavior with Lightweight Generative Models and LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06994v3)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Application profiling is an indispensable technique for many software development tasks, such as code and memory layout optimizations, where optimization decisions are tailored to specific program profiles. Unfortunately, modern application codebases exhibit highly variant behavior across different inputs, creating challenges for conventional profiling approaches that rely on a single representative execution instance. In this paper, we propose \textbf{Phaedrus}, a new \textit{compiler-assisted deep learning framework} designed to predict dynamic program behaviors across varied execution instances, specifically focusing on dynamic function call prediction.Such predicted call sequences are then used for producing optimized code pertinent to a given input. Traditional profile-guided optimization methods struggle with the input-dependent variability of modern applications, where profiling on different inputs yields divergent application behaviors. To address this, Phaedrus proposes two new approaches: \textit{Application Behavior Synthesis}, a profile-less approach where Large Language Models (LLMs) directly infer dynamic functions based on source code \& static compiler analysis, bypassing the need for traditional profiling, and \textit{Application Profile Generalization}, which uses generative models trained on compressed and augmented \textit{Whole Program Path} (WPP) based function profiles to predict application behavior under unseen inputs. Our experiments show that \textit{Phaedrus} can achieve upto $10^7X$ reduction in WPP function profile sizes, can predict most frequently executed functions that cover upto 85-99\% of the execution time, along with an average of 13.19\% (upto 65\%) reduction in application binary size, and an average of 6.08\% (upto 20\%) performance improvement over the traditional profile-guided optimization, without any execution.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Mathematical Relationship Between Layer Normalization and Dynamic Activation Functions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21708v3)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Layer normalization (LN) is an essential component of modern neural networks. While many alternative techniques have been proposed, none of them have succeeded in replacing LN so far. The latest suggestion in this line of research is a dynamic activation function called Dynamic Tanh (DyT). Although it is empirically well-motivated and appealing from a practical point of view, it lacks a theoretical foundation. In this work, we shed light on the mathematical relationship between LN and dynamic activation functions. In particular, we derive DyT from the LN variant RMSNorm, and show that a well-defined decoupling in derivative space as well as an approximation are needed to do so. By applying the same decoupling procedure directly in function space, we are able to omit the approximation and obtain the exact element-wise counterpart of RMSNorm, which we call Dynamic Inverse Square Root Unit (DyISRU). We demonstrate numerically that DyISRU reproduces the normalization effect on outliers more accurately than DyT does.</p></details> | <details><summary>Revis...</summary><p>Revision and Simplification (starting point RMSNorm instead of LN)</p></details> |
| **[Can LLMs Handle WebShell Detection? Overcoming Detection Challenges with Behavioral Function-Aware Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13811v4)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>WebShell attacks, where malicious scripts are injected into web servers, pose a significant cybersecurity threat. Traditional ML and DL methods are often hampered by challenges such as the need for extensive training data, catastrophic forgetting, and poor generalization. Recently, Large Language Models have emerged as powerful alternatives for code-related tasks, but their potential in WebShell detection remains underexplored. In this paper, we make two contributions: (1) a comprehensive evaluation of seven LLMs, including GPT-4, LLaMA 3.1 70B, and Qwen 2.5 variants, benchmarked against traditional sequence- and graph-based methods using a dataset of 26.59K PHP scripts, and (2) the Behavioral Function-Aware Detection (BFAD) framework, designed to address the specific challenges of applying LLMs to this domain. Our framework integrates three components: a Critical Function Filter that isolates malicious PHP function calls, a Context-Aware Code Extraction strategy that captures the most behaviorally indicative code segments, and Weighted Behavioral Function Profiling that enhances in-context learning by prioritizing the most relevant demonstrations based on discriminative function-level profiles. Our results show that, stemming from their distinct analytical strategies, larger LLMs achieve near-perfect precision but lower recall, while smaller models exhibit the opposite trade-off. However, all baseline models lag behind previous SOTA methods. With the application of BFAD, the performance of all LLMs improves significantly, yielding an average F1 score increase of 13.82%. Notably, larger models now outperform SOTA benchmarks, while smaller models such as Qwen-2.5-Coder-3B achieve performance competitive with traditional methods. This work is the first to explore the feasibility and limitations of LLMs for WebShell detection and provides solutions to address the challenges in this task.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at COLM 2025</p></details> |
| **[Talk Less, Call Right: Enhancing Role-Play LLM Agents with Automatic Prompt Optimization and Role Prompting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00482v2)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This report investigates approaches for prompting a tool-augmented large language model (LLM) to act as a role-playing dialogue agent in the API track of the Commonsense Persona-grounded Dialogue Challenge (CPDC) 2025. In this setting, dialogue agents often produce overly long in-character responses (over-speaking) while failing to use tools effectively according to the persona (under-acting), such as generating function calls that do not exist or making unnecessary tool calls before answering. We explore four prompting approaches to address these issues: 1) basic role prompting, 2) improved role prompting, 3) automatic prompt optimization (APO), and 4) rule-based role prompting. The rule-based role prompting (RRP) approach achieved the best performance through two novel techniques-character-card/scene-contract design and strict enforcement of function calling-which led to an overall score of 0.571, improving on the zero-shot baseline score of 0.519. These findings demonstrate that RRP design can substantially improve the effectiveness and reliability of role-playing dialogue agents compared with more elaborate methods such as APO. To support future efforts in developing persona prompts, we are open-sourcing all of our best-performing prompts and the APO tool Source code is available at https://github.com/scb-10x/apo</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2025 Wordplay Workshop (Spotlight)</p></details> |
| **[Don't Just Fine-tune the Agent, Tune the Environment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10197v1)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM) agents show great promise for complex, multi-turn tool-use tasks, but their development is often hampered by the extreme scarcity of high-quality training data. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on synthetic data leads to overfitting, whereas standard reinforcement learning (RL) struggles with a critical cold-start problem and training instability. To address these challenges, we introduce $\textbf{Environment Tuning}$, a novel training paradigm that enables agents to learn complex behaviors directly from problem instances without relying on pre-collected expert trajectories. $\textbf{Environment Tuning}$ orchestrates this learning process through a structured curriculum, actionable environment augmentation that provides corrective feedback, and fine-grained progress rewards to ensure stable and efficient exploration. Using only 400 problem instances from Berkeley Function-Calling Leaderboard (BFCL) benchmark, our method not only achieves competitive in-distribution performance against strong baselines but also demonstrates superior out-of-distribution generalization, overcoming the performance collapse common to SFT-based approaches. Our work presents a paradigm shift from supervised fine-tuning on static trajectories to dynamic, environment-based exploration, paving the way for training more robust and data-efficient agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Joint Embeddings of Function and Process Call Graphs for Malware Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09984v1)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software systems can be represented as graphs, capturing dependencies among functions and processes. An interesting aspect of software systems is that they can be represented as different types of graphs, depending on the extraction goals and priorities. For example, function calls within the software can be captured to create function call graphs, which highlight the relationships between functions and their dependencies. Alternatively, the processes spawned by the software can be modeled to generate process interaction graphs, which focus on runtime behavior and inter-process communication. While these graph representations are related, each captures a distinct perspective of the system, providing complementary insights into its structure and operation. While previous studies have leveraged graph neural networks (GNNs) to analyze software behaviors, most of this work has focused on a single type of graph representation. The joint modeling of both function call graphs and process interaction graphs remains largely underexplored, leaving opportunities for deeper, multi-perspective analysis of software systems. This paper presents a pipeline for constructing and training Function Call Graphs (FCGs) and Process Call Graphs (PCGs) and learning joint embeddings. We demonstrate that joint embeddings outperform a single-graph model. In this paper, we propose GeminiNet, a unified neural network approach that learns joint embeddings from both FCGs and PCGs. We construct a new dataset of 635 Windows executables (318 malicious and 317 benign), extracting FCGs via Ghidra and PCGs via Any.Run sandbox. GeminiNet employs dual graph convolutional branches with an adaptive gating mechanism that balances contributions from static and dynamic views.</p></details> |  |
| **[Issue Localization via LLM-Driven Iterative Code Graph Searching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22424v3)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Issue solving aims to generate patches to fix reported issues in real-world code repositories according to issue descriptions. Issue localization forms the basis for accurate issue solving. Recently, LLM-based issue localization methods have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance. However, these methods either search from files mentioned in issue descriptions or in the whole repository and struggle to balance the breadth and depth of the search space to converge on the target efficiently. Moreover, they allow LLM to explore whole repositories freely, making it challenging to control the search direction to prevent the LLM from searching for incorrect targets. This paper introduces CoSIL, an LLM-driven, powerful function-level issue localization method without training or indexing. CoSIL employs a two-phase code graph search strategy. It first conducts broad exploration at the file level using dynamically constructed module call graphs, and then performs in-depth analysis at the function level by expanding the module call graph into a function call graph and executing iterative searches. To precisely control the search direction, CoSIL designs a pruner to filter unrelated directions and irrelevant contexts. To avoid incorrect interaction formats in long contexts, CoSIL introduces a reflection mechanism that uses additional independent queries in short contexts to enhance formatted abilities. Experiment results demonstrate that CoSIL achieves a Top-1 localization accuracy of 43.3\% and 44.6\% on SWE-bench Lite and SWE-bench Verified, respectively, with Qwen2.5-Coder-32B, average outperforming the state-of-the-art methods by 96.04\%. When CoSIL is integrated into an issue-solving method, Agentless, the issue resolution rate improves by 2.98\%--30.5\%.</p></details> | Accepted by ASE 2025 |
| **[Reasoning through Exploration: A Reinforcement Learning Framework for Robust Function Calling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05118v4)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The effective training of Large Language Models (LLMs) for function calling faces a critical challenge: balancing exploration of complex reasoning paths with stable policy optimization. Standard methods like Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) fail to instill robust reasoning, and traditional Reinforcement Learning (RL) struggles with inefficient exploration. We propose \textbf{EGPO}, a new RL framework built upon Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), designed to address this challenge directly. The core of EGPO is an entropy-enhanced advantage function that integrates the entropy of the model's Chain-of-Thought (CoT) into the policy gradient computation. This encourages the generation of diverse reasoning strategies. To maintain optimization direction, the entropy bonus is carefully constrained by a clipping mechanism. Complemented by a strict, binary reward signal, EGPO effectively guides the model towards discovering structured and accurate tool invocation patterns. On the challenging Berkeley Function Calling Leaderboard (BFCL), a 4B-parameter model trained with EGPO sets a new state-of-the-art among models of comparable size, surpassing a range of strong competitors, including GPT-4o and Gemini-2.5.</p></details> |  |
| **[PARL-MT: Learning to Call Functions in Multi-Turn Conversation with Progress Awareness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23206v3)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive success in single-turn function calling, yet real-world applications such as travel planning or multi-stage data analysis typically unfold across multi-turn conversations. In these settings, LLMs must not only issue accurate function calls at each step but also maintain progress awareness, the ability to summarize past interactions and plan future actions to ensure coherent, long-horizon task execution. Existing approaches, however, either reduce multi-turn training to isolated single-turn samples, which neglects task-level planning, or employ end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL) that struggles with redundancy and lacks explicit integration of progress awareness. To overcome these limitations, we introduce PARL-MT, a framework that explicitly incorporates progress awareness into LLM training for multi-turn function calling. PARL-MT combines (i) a Progress Awareness Generation (PAG) pipeline, which automatically constructs datasets coupling conversation summaries with future task planning, and (ii) a Progress Awareness-Guided Reinforcement Learning (PAG-RL) algorithm, which integrates progress awareness into RL training to reduce contextual redundancy and improve alignment between local actions and global task completion. Empirical results on two public benchmarks demonstrate that PARL-MT significantly outperforms existing methods, highlighting the effectiveness of progress awareness in enabling robust and efficient multi-turn function calling.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scaling LLM Multi-turn RL with End-to-end Summarization-based Context Management](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06727v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning of large language model (LLM) agents for long-horizon multi-turn tool use, where context length quickly becomes a fundamental bottleneck. Existing RL pipelines can suffer from degraded instruction following, excessive rollout costs, and most importantly, strict context limits. To address these challenges, we introduce summarization-based context management to training. In specific, it periodically compresses the tool using history by LLM-generated summaries that retain task-relevant information to keep a compact context while enabling the agent to scale beyond the fixed context window. Building on this formulation, we derive a policy gradient representation that seamlessly enables standard LLM RL infrastructures to optimize both tool-use behaviors as well as summarization strategies in an end-to-end fashion. We instantiate this framework with \underline{SU}mmarization augmented \underline{P}olicy \underline{O}ptimization (\texttt{SUPO}), an LLM RL algorithm that enables long-horizon training beyond a fixed context limit. Experiments on interactive function calling and searching tasks demonstrate that \texttt{SUPO} significantly improves the success rate while maintaining the same or even lower working context length compared to baselines. We also demonstrate that for complex searching tasks, \texttt{SUPO} can further improve the evaluation performance when scaling test-time maximum round of summarization beyond that of training time. Our results establish summarization-based context management as a principled and scalable approach for training RL agents beyond a fixed context length limit.</p></details> |  |
| **[LogSTOP: Temporal Scores over Prediction Sequences for Matching and Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06512v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural models such as YOLO and HuBERT can be used to detect local properties such as objects ("car") and emotions ("angry") in individual frames of videos and audio clips respectively. The likelihood of these detections is indicated by scores in [0, 1]. Lifting these scores to temporal properties over sequences can be useful for several downstream applications such as query matching (e.g., "does the speaker eventually sound happy in this audio clip?"), and ranked retrieval (e.g., "retrieve top 5 videos with a 10 second scene where a car is detected until a pedestrian is detected"). In this work, we formalize this problem of assigning Scores for TempOral Properties (STOPs) over sequences, given potentially noisy score predictors for local properties. We then propose a scoring function called LogSTOP that can efficiently compute these scores for temporal properties represented in Linear Temporal Logic. Empirically, LogSTOP, with YOLO and HuBERT, outperforms Large Vision / Audio Language Models and other Temporal Logic-based baselines by at least 16% on query matching with temporal properties over objects-in-videos and emotions-in-speech respectively. Similarly, on ranked retrieval with temporal properties over objects and actions in videos, LogSTOP with Grounding DINO and SlowR50 reports at least a 19% and 16% increase in mean average precision and recall over zero-shot text-to-video retrieval baselines respectively.</p></details> |  |

A classic result on these functions, called the Leftover Hash Lemma, gives an estimate of the distance from uniformity based on the assumptions about the min-entropy of the source. We prove several results concerning extensions of this lemma to a class of functions that are $k^\ast$-universal, i.e., $l$-universal for all $2\le l\le k$. As a common distinctive feature, our results provide estimates of closeness to uniformity in terms of the $\alpha$-R{\'e}nyi divergence for all $\alpha\in (1,\infty]$. For $1\le \alpha\le k$ we show that it is possible to convert all the randomness of the source measured in $\alpha$-\Renyi entropy into approximately uniform bits with nearly the same amount of randomness. For large enough $k$ we show that it is possible to distill random bits that are nearly uniform, as measured by min-entropy. We also extend these results to hashing with side information.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, double-column format.

| **[Conformal Prediction for Long-Tailed Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06867v2)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many real-world classification problems, such as plant identification, have extremely long-tailed class distributions. In order for prediction sets to be useful in such settings, they should (i) provide good class-conditional coverage, ensuring that rare classes are not systematically omitted from the prediction sets, and (ii) be a reasonable size, allowing users to easily verify candidate labels. Unfortunately, existing conformal prediction methods, when applied to the long-tailed setting, force practitioners to make a binary choice between small sets with poor class-conditional coverage or sets with very good class-conditional coverage but that are extremely large. We propose methods with guaranteed marginal coverage that smoothly trade off between set size and class-conditional coverage. First, we introduce a new conformal score function called prevalence-adjusted softmax that targets macro-coverage, a relaxed notion of class-conditional coverage. Second, we propose a new procedure that interpolates between marginal and class-conditional conformal prediction by linearly interpolating their conformal score thresholds. We demonstrate our methods on Pl@ntNet-300K and iNaturalist-2018, two long-tailed image datasets with 1,081 and 8,142 classes, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Compositional Verification in Concurrent Separation Logic with Permissions Regions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18115v2)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Concurrent separation logic with fractional permissions (CSLPerm) provides a promising reasoning system to verify most complex sequential and concurrent fine-grained programs. The logic with strong and weak separating conjunctions offers a solid foundation for producing concise and precise proofs. However, it lacks automation and compositionality support. This paper addresses this limitation by introducing a compositional verification system for concurrent programs that manipulate regions of shared memory. The centre of our system is novel logical principles and an entailment procedure that can infer the residual heaps in the frame rule for a fragment of CSL-Perm with explicit arithmetical constraints for memory heaps' disjointness. This procedure enables the compositional reasoning for concurrent threads and function calls. We have implemented the proposal in a prototype tool called CoSl, tested it with 10 challenging concurrent programs, including those beyond the state-of-the-art, and confirmed the advantage of our approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[AgentRL: Scaling Agentic Reinforcement Learning with a Multi-Turn, Multi-Task Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04206v1)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have sparked growing interest in building generalist agents that can learn through online interactions. However, applying reinforcement learning (RL) to train LLM agents in multi-turn, multi-task settings remains challenging due to lack of scalable infrastructure and stable training algorithms. In this work, we present the AgentRL framework for scalable multi-turn, multi-task agentic RL training. On the infrastructure side, AgentRL features a fully-asynchronous generation-training pipeline for efficient multi-turn RL. To support heterogeneous environment development in multi-task RL, we design a unified function-call based API interface, containerized environment development, and a centralized controller. On the algorithm side, we propose cross-policy sampling to encourage model exploration in multi-turn settings and task advantage normalization to stabilize multi-task training. Experiments show that AgentRL, trained on open LLMs across five agentic tasks, significantly outperforms GPT-5, Clause-Sonnet-4, DeepSeek-R1, and other open-source LLM agents. Multi-task training with AgentRL matches the best results among all task-specific models. AgentRL is open-sourced at https://github.com/THUDM/AgentRL. The algorithm and framework are adopted in building \textsc{\href{https://autoglm.zhipuai.cn}{AutoGLM}}.</p></details> |  |
| **[Small Language Models for Agentic Systems: A Survey of Architectures, Capabilities, and Deployment Trade offs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03847v1)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Small language models (SLMs; 1-12B params, sometimes up to 20B) are sufficient and often superior for agentic workloads where the objective is schema- and API-constrained accuracy rather than open-ended generation. We synthesize recent evidence across open and proprietary SLMs (Phi-4-Mini, Qwen-2.5-7B, Gemma-2-9B, Llama-3.2-1B/3B, Ministral-3B/8B, Apple on-device 3B, DeepSeek-R1-Distill) and connect it to modern evaluations (BFCL v3/v4, StableToolBench) and serving stacks (vLLM, SGLang, TensorRT-LLM) paired with guided decoding libraries (XGrammar, Outlines). We formalize SLM-default, LLM-fallback systems with uncertainty-aware routing and verifier cascades, and propose engineering metrics that reflect real production goals: cost per successful task (CPS), schema validity rate, executable call rate, p50/p95 latency, and energy per request. Guided decoding, strict JSON Schema outputs, and validator-first tool execution close much of the capability gap with larger models and often let SLMs match or surpass LLMs on tool use, function calling, and RAG at 10x-100x lower token cost with materially better latency and energy. We provide design patterns for agent stacks that prioritize SLMs: schema-first prompting, type-safe function registries, confidence scoring with verifier rollups, and lightweight adaptation via LoRA/QLoRA. We also delineate limits where fallback remains valuable (open-domain reasoning and some long-horizon planning). The result is a practical blueprint for building fast, inexpensive, and reliable agents that default to SLMs while preserving headroom with targeted LLM assistance. Keywords: small language models, agents, function calling, structured outputs, JSON Schema, guided decoding, LoRA/QLoRA, routing, energy efficiency, edge inference</p></details> | 9 Pages |
| **[The Kolmogorov Superposition Theorem can Break the Curse of Dimensionality When Approximating High Dimensional Functions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.09963v6)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We explain how to use Kolmogorov Superposition Theorem (KST) to break the curse of dimensionality when approximating a dense class of multivariate continuous functions. We first show that there is a class of functions called Kolmogorov-Lipschitz (KL) continuous in $C([0,1]^d)$ which can be approximated by a special ReLU neural network of two hidden layers with a dimension independent approximation rate $O(1/n)$ with approximation constant increasing quadratically in $d$. The number of parameters used in such neural network approximation equals to $(6d+2)n$. Next we introduce KB-splines by using linear B-splines to replace the outer function and smooth the KB-splines to have the so-called LKB-splines as the basis for approximation. Our numerical evidence shows that the curse of dimensionality is broken in the following sense: When using the standard discrete least squares (DLS) method to approximate a continuous function, there exists a pivotal set of points in $[0,1]^d$ with size at most $O(nd)$ such that the rooted mean squares error (RMSE) from the DLS based on the pivotal set is similar to the RMSE of the DLS based on the original set with size $O(n^d)$. The pivotal point set is chosen by using matrix cross approximation technique and the number of LKB-splines used for approximation is the same as the size of the pivotal data set. Therefore, we do not need too many basis functions nor too many function values to approximate a high dimensional continuous function $f$. Hence, the study in this paper provides an approach for dimension reduction problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[A* Search Without Expansions: Learning Heuristic Functions with Deep Q-Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.04518v3)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficiently solving problems with large action spaces using A* search remains a significant challenge. This is because, for each iteration of A* search, the number of nodes generated and the number of heuristic function applications grow linearly with the size of the action space. This burden becomes even more apparent when A* search uses a heuristic function learned by computationally expensive function approximators, such as deep neural networks. To address this issue, we introduce Q*, a search algorithm that leverages heuristics capable of receiving a state and, in a single function call, returning cost-to-go estimates for all possible transitions from that state, along with estimates of the corresponding transition costs -- without the need to apply the transitions or generate the successor states; such action-state estimation are typically known as Q-values. This significantly reduces computation time and memory usage. In addition, we prove that Q* search is guaranteed to find a shortest path given a heuristic function that does not overestimate the sum of the transition cost and cost-to-go of the state. To obtain heuristics for Q* search, we employ a deep Q-network architecture to learn a state-action heuristic function from domain interaction, without any prior knowledge. We use Q* with our learned heuristic on different domains and action spaces, showing that Q* suffers from only a small runtime overhead as the size of the action space increases. In addition, our empirical results show Q* search is up to 129 times faster and generates up to 1288 times fewer nodes than A* search.</p></details> | <details><summary>Added...</summary><p>Added more detailed comparisons to A*, deffered heuristics, and partial expansion.

| **[Align Your Tangent: Training Better Consistency Models via Manifold-Aligned Tangents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00658v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With diffusion and flow matching models achieving state-of-the-art generating performance, the interest of the community now turned to reducing the inference time without sacrificing sample quality. Consistency Models (CMs), which are trained to be consistent on diffusion or probability flow ordinary differential equation (PF-ODE) trajectories, enable one or two-step flow or diffusion sampling. However, CMs typically require prolonged training with large batch sizes to obtain competitive sample quality. In this paper, we examine the training dynamics of CMs near convergence and discover that CM tangents -- CM output update directions -- are quite oscillatory, in the sense that they move parallel to the data manifold, not towards the manifold. To mitigate oscillatory tangents, we propose a new loss function, called the manifold feature distance (MFD), which provides manifold-aligned tangents that point toward the data manifold. Consequently, our method -- dubbed Align Your Tangent (AYT) -- can accelerate CM training by orders of magnitude and even out-perform the learned perceptual image patch similarity metric (LPIPS). Furthermore, we find that our loss enables training with extremely small batch sizes without compromising sample quality. Code: https://github.com/1202kbs/AYT</p></details> | Preprint |

We diagnose overthinking via oracle rollouts that inject </think> at sentence boundaries. On the Berkeley Function Calling Leaderboard (BFCL), this oracle termination lifts average accuracy from 85.8\% to 94.2\% while reducing tokens by 80-94\%, revealing substantial recoverable headroom and potential redundant reasoning. While prior work on concise reasoning has largely targeted mathematics, tool reasoning remains underexplored. We adapt various early-termination baselines to tool use and introduce ThinkBrake, a training-free decoding heuristic. ThinkBrake monitors the log-probability margin between </think> and the current top token at sentence boundaries and triggers termination when this margin becomes small. Across BFCL's single turn, non-live and live splits, ThinkBrake preserves or improves accuracy while reducing tokens up to 25\%, outperforming various baselines.</p></details> |  |

However, existing approaches often struggle with architecture-specific limitations, data scarcity, and diverse naming conventions. We present AGNOMIN, a novel architecture-agnostic approach for multi-label function name prediction in stripped binaries. AGNOMIN builds Feature-Enriched Hierarchical Graphs (FEHGs), combining Control Flow Graphs, Function Call Graphs, and dynamically learned \texttt{PCode} features. A hierarchical graph neural network processes this enriched structure to generate consistent function representations across architectures, vital for \textbf{scalable security assessments}. For function name prediction, AGNOMIN employs a Ren\'ee-inspired decoder, enhanced with an attention-based head layer and algorithmic improvements. We evaluate AGNOMIN on a comprehensive dataset of 9,000 ELF executable binaries across three architectures, demonstrating its superior performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches, with improvements of up to 27.17\% in precision and 55.86\% in recall across the testing dataset. Moreover, AGNOMIN generalizes well to unseen architectures, achieving 5.89\% higher recall than the closest baseline. AGNOMIN's practical utility has been validated through security hackathons, where it successfully aided reverse engineers in analyzing and patching vulnerable binaries across different architectures.</p></details> |  |
| **[TokMem: Tokenized Procedural Memory for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00444v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models rely heavily on prompts to specify tasks, recall knowledge and guide reasoning. However, this reliance is inefficient as prompts must be re-read at each step, scale poorly across tasks, and lack mechanisms for modular reuse. We introduce TokMem, a tokenized procedural memory that stores recurring procedures as compact, trainable embeddings. Each memory token encodes both an address to a procedure and a control signal that steers generation, enabling targeted behavior with constant-size overhead. To support continual adaptation, TokMem keeps the backbone model frozen, allowing new procedures to be added without interfering with existing ones. We evaluate TokMem on 1,000 tasks for atomic recall, and on function-calling tasks for compositional recall, where it consistently outperforms retrieval-augmented generation while avoiding repeated context overhead, and fine-tuning with far fewer parameters. These results establish TokMem as a scalable and modular alternative to prompt engineering and fine-tuning, offering an explicit procedural memory for LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Reliable Benchmarking: A Contamination Free, Controllable Evaluation Framework for Multi-step LLM Function Calling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26553v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As language models gain access to external tools via structured function calls, they become increasingly more capable of solving complex, multi-step tasks. However, existing benchmarks for tool-augmented language models (TaLMs) provide insufficient control over factors such as the number of functions accessible, task complexity, and input size, and remain vulnerable to data contamination. We present FuncBenchGen, a unified, contamination-free framework that evaluates TaLMs by generating synthetic multi-step tool-use tasks. The key idea is to cast tool use as traversal over a hidden function-dependency DAG where nodes are function calls and an edge between nodes represents one function consuming the output of another. Given a set of external function schemas, initial variable values, and a target variable, models must compose the correct call sequence to compute the target variable. FuncBenchGen allows users to precisely control task difficulty (e.g., graph size, dependency depth, and distractor functions) while avoiding data leakage. We apply our FuncBenchGen framework to evaluate seven LLMs on tool use tasks of varying difficulty. Reasoning-optimized models consistently outperform general-purpose models with GPT-5 significantly outperforming other models. Performance declines sharply as dependency depth increases. Furthermore, connected irrelevant functions prove especially difficult to handle. We find that strong models often make syntactically valid function calls but propagate incorrect or stale argument values across steps, revealing brittle state tracking by LLMs in multi-turn tool use. Motivated by this observation, we introduce a simple mitigation strategy that explicitly restates prior variable values to the agent at each step. Surprisingly, this lightweight change yields substantial gains across models. e.g., yielding a success rate improvement from 62.5% to 81.3% for GPT-5.</p></details> |  |

This involves tracking individual neutrons through a computational geometry. CPU-based MC codes use multiple polymorphic tracker types with different tracking algorithms to exploit the repeated configurations of reactors, but virtual function calls have high overhead on the GPU. The Shift MC code was modified to support GPU-based tracking with three strategies: dynamic polymorphism with virtual functions, static polymorphism, and a single tracker type with tree-based acceleration. On the Frontier supercomputer these methods achieve 77.8%, 91.2%, and 83.4%, respectively, of the tracking rate obtained using a specialized tracker optimized for rectilinear-grid-based reactors. This indicates that all three methods are suitable for typical reactor problems in which tracking does not dominate runtime. The flexibility of the single tracker method is highlighted with a hexagonal-grid microreactor problem, performed without hexagonal-grid-specific tracking routines, providing a 2.19$\times$ speedup over CPU execution.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inter...</summary><p>International Journal of High Performance Computing Applications, 2025</p></details> |

Error wrapping, a practice prevalent in modern microservice development, enriches errors with context at each layer of the function call stack, constructing an error chain that describes a failure from its technical origin to its business impact. However, this also presents a significant traceability problem when recovering the complete error propagation path from the final log message back to its source. Existing approaches are ineffective at addressing this problem. To fill this gap, we present ErrorPrism in this work for automated reconstruction of error propagation paths in production microservice systems. ErrorPrism first performs static analysis on service code repositories to build a function call graph and map log strings to relevant candidate functions. This significantly reduces the path search space for subsequent analysis. Then, ErrorPrism employs an LLM agent to perform an iterative backward search to accurately reconstruct the complete, multi-hop error path. Evaluated on 67 production microservices at ByteDance, ErrorPrism achieves 97.0% accuracy in reconstructing paths for 102 real-world errors, outperforming existing static analysis and LLM-based approaches. ErrorPrism provides an effective and practical tool for root cause analysis in industrial microservice systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 6 figures, 1 table, this paper has been accepted by the 40th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering, ASE 2025</p></details> |

Central to this process is the quality and diversity of post-training datasets. This paper presents a review of publicly available Arabic post-training datasets on the Hugging Face Hub, organized along four key dimensions: (1) LLM Capabilities (e.g., Question Answering, Translation, Reasoning, Summarization, Dialogue, Code Generation, and Function Calling); (2) Steerability (e.g., Persona and System Prompts); (3) Alignment (e.g., Cultural, Safety, Ethics, and Fairness); and (4) Robustness. Each dataset is rigorously evaluated based on popularity, practical adoption, recency and maintenance, documentation and annotation quality, licensing transparency, and scientific contribution. Our review revealed critical gaps in the development of Arabic post-training datasets, including limited task diversity, inconsistent or missing documentation and annotation, and low adoption across the community. Finally, the paper discusses the implications of these gaps on the progress of Arabic-centric LLMs and applications while providing concrete recommendations for future efforts in Arabic post-training dataset development.</p></details> |  |

The data-centric nature of these libraries makes the detection of API misuse in them more challenging. This paper introduces DSCHECKER, an LLM-based approach designed for detecting and fixing API misuses of data science libraries. We identify two key pieces of information, API directives and data information, that may be beneficial for API misuse detection and fixing. Using three LLMs and misuses from five data science libraries, we experiment with various prompts. We find that incorporating API directives and data-specific details enhances Dschecker's ability to detect and fix API misuses, with the best-performing model achieving a detection F1-score of 61.18 percent and fixing 51.28 percent of the misuses. Building on these results, we implement Dschecker agent which includes an adaptive function calling mechanism to access information on demand, simulating a real-world setting where information about the misuse is unknown in advance. We find that Dschecker agent achieves 48.65 percent detection F1-score and fixes 39.47 percent of the misuses, demonstrating the promise of LLM-based API misuse detection and fixing in real-world scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 3 figures, accepted in CASCON 25</p></details> |

The challenge consists of three tasks, aiming to build an in-game conversational AI that adheres to character personas, aligns with the game's worldview, and supports function calling. Considering both effectiveness and resource/time constraints during inference, we synthesized data for some of the tasks based on the datasets provided by the competition organizers. We employed Qwen3-14B with LoRA fine-tuning and model fusion, and utilized a base model integrated with multiple LoRA adapters during inference. Specifically, in the competition, we used three distinct LoRA adapters to handle tool calling, response generation with tool call results, and response generation without tool call results, respectively. MultiLoRA inference was implemented using vLLM. Our solution achieved the first place in Task 1 and Task 3, and the second place in Task 2 of the GPU track.</p></details> | 8 pages |
| **[Forcrat: Automatic I/O API Translation from C to Rust via Origin and Capability Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01427v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Translating C to Rust is a promising way to enhance the reliability of legacy system programs. Although the industry has developed an automatic C-to-Rust translator, C2Rust, its translation remains unsatisfactory. One major reason is that C2Rust retains C standard library (libc) function calls instead of replacing them with functions from the Rust standard library (Rust std). However, little work has been done on replacing library functions in C2Rust-generated code. In this work, we focus on replacing the I/O API, an important subset of library functions. This poses challenges due to the semantically different designs of I/O APIs in libc and Rust std. First, the two APIs offer different sets of types that represent the origins (e.g., standard input, files) and capabilities (e.g., read, write) of streams used for I/O. Second, they use different error-checking mechanisms: libc uses internal indicators, while Rust std uses return values. To address these challenges, we propose two static analysis techniques, origin and capability analysis and error source analysis, and use their results to replace the I/O API. Our evaluation shows that the proposed approach is (1) correct, with all 32 programs that have test suites passing the tests after transformation, (2) efficient, analyzing and transforming 422k LOC in 14 seconds, and (3) widely applicable, replacing 82% of I/O API calls.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables, In Proceedings of the 40th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering (ASE 2025)</p></details> |

Multi-agent approaches can leverage external experts, but inevitably introduce communication overhead and suffer from inefficiency caused by limited scalability. To this end, we propose Physically-isolated Experts Routing Network (PiERN), an architecture for integrating computation and reasoning. Instead of the tool-use workflows or function-calling, PiERN endogenously integrates computational capabilities into neural networks after separately training experts, a text-to-computation module, and a router. At inference, the router directs computation and reasoning at the token level, thereby enabling iterative alternation within a single chain of thought. We evaluate PiERN on representative linear and nonlinear computation-reasoning tasks against LLM finetuning and the multi-agent system approaches. Results show that the PiERN architecture achieves not only higher accuracy than directly finetuning LLMs but also significant improvements in response latency, token usage, and GPU energy consumption compared with mainstream multi-agent approaches. PiERN offers an efficient, interpretable, and scalable paradigm for interfacing language models with scientific systems.</p></details> |  |

We address this gap through a novel approach for solving problems in the class NP. We focus on the paradigmatic task of Sudoku and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy (99\%) compared to prior neuro-symbolic approaches. Unlike prior work that used custom architectures, our method employs a vanilla decoder-only Transformer (GPT-2) without external tools or function calling. Our method integrates imitation learning of simple Sudoku rules with an explicit Depth-First Search (DFS) exploration strategy involving informed guessing and backtracking. Moving beyond imitation learning, we seek to minimize the number of guesses until reaching a solution. We provide a rigorous analysis of this setup formalizing its connection to a contextual variant of Min-Sum Set Cover, a well-studied problem in algorithms and stochastic optimization.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we address an embedding misalignment issue that often arises in practical applications due to imperfect embedding models or noisy descriptions; such misalignment may lead to incorrect retrieval and task failure. We introduce Online-Optimized RAG, a deployment-time framework that continually adapts retrieval embeddings from live interactions using minimal feedback (e.g., task success). Online-Optimized RAG applies lightweight online gradient updates with negligible per-query latency and requires no changes to the underlying LLM. The method is plug-and-play: it supports both single- and multi-hop tool use, dynamic tool inventories, and $K$-retrieval with re-ranking. We provide a problem-dependent theoretical analysis that quantifies how the method's performance depends on the initialization quality of the embeddings and other related quantities. Across diverse tool-use and document-retrieval scenarios, our Online-Optimized RAG consistently improves tool selection accuracy and end-task success, thus providing a simple, practical path to robust, self-improving RAG systems.</p></details> |  |

However, even state-of-the-art autoregressive Large Language Models (LLMs) today exhibit unreliability when required to generate structured output. Inspired by the current new diffusion-based large language models (dLLM), we realize that the architectural difference, especially the global information-sharing mechanism for language modeling, may be the key to unlock next-level controllable generation. To explore the possibility, we propose Self-adaptive Schema Scaffolding ($S^3$), a novel framework that enables dLLM to stably generate reliable structured outputs (e.g., JSON) by utilizing its innate reverse reasoning capability and global context awareness. $S^3$ initiates a schematic template directly in the output context as a starting state for dLLM, offering a more robust and general method than intricate prompt optimization. Experiments demonstrate that our method substantially unlocks the dLLM's potential in controllable generation in terms of structure adherence, content fidelity, and faithfulness. These results establish new perspectives and practical pathways for deploying language models in controllable generation tasks.</p></details> |  |

We propose a framework based on deterministic finite automata (DFAs) that encodes tasks as sets of valid tool-use paths, enabling principled assessment of agent behavior in diverse world models. Building on this foundation, we introduce CORE, a suite of five metrics, namely Path Correctness, Path Correctness - Kendall's tau Composite, Prefix Criticality, Harmful-Call Rate, and Efficiency, that quantify alignment with expected execution patterns. Across diverse worlds, our method reveals important performance differences between agents that would otherwise appear equivalent under traditional final-state evaluation schemes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted: LAW 2025 Workshop NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

Existing benchmarks such as the Berkeley Function Calling Leaderboard (BFCL), tau^2-Bench (arXiv:2506.07982), and ACEBench (arXiv:2501.12851) evaluate argument correctness but do not test adherence to format instructions embedded in parameter descriptions, such as enclosing values in double quotes or using ISO date formats. We introduce IFEval-FC, a benchmark inspired by IFEval (arXiv:2311.07911) that assesses precise instruction following in function calling. IFEval-FC encodes verifiable formats directly within JSON schema descriptions, for example specifying that a value must not contain punctuation. It includes 750 test cases, each consisting of a function with an embedded format for one of its input parameters and a corresponding user query. Evaluation is fully algorithmic, ensuring objectivity, reproducibility, and scalability. Our results show that even state-of-the-art proprietary models, including GPT-5 and Claude 4.1 Opus, frequently fail to follow basic formatting rules, highlighting a practical limitation for real-world agent systems.

These issues often stem from an incomplete understanding of user goals and inadequate comprehension of tool documentation. While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has proven effective for enhancing reasoning in general contexts, our analysis reveals that free-form CoT is insufficient and sometimes counterproductive for structured function-calling tasks. To address this, we introduce a curriculum-inspired framework that leverages structured reasoning templates to guide LLMs through more deliberate step-by-step instructions for generating function callings. Experimental results show that our method reduces tool-use errors, achieving 3-12% relative improvements over strong baselines across diverse model series and approaches. Moreover, our framework enhances the robustness, interpretability, and transparency of tool-using agents, advancing the development of more reliable AI assistants for real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2025 Main Conference</p></details> |

However, these systems are increasingly vulnerable to prompt injection attacks, where adversaries manipulate inputs to elicit unintended behaviors such as leaking sensitive information or generating harmful content. This paper presents a case study on the design and implementation of a secure retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) chatbot for Hsinchu smart tourism services. The system integrates RAG with API function calls, multi-layered linguistic analysis, and guardrails against injections, achieving high contextual awareness and security. Key features include a tiered response strategy, RAG-driven knowledge grounding, and intent decomposition across lexical, semantic, and pragmatic levels. Defense mechanisms include system norms, gatekeepers for intent judgment, and reverse RAG text to prioritize verified data. We also benchmark a GPT-5 variant (released 2025-08-07) to assess inherent robustness. Evaluations with 674 adversarial prompts and 223 benign queries show over 95% accuracy on benign tasks and substantial detection of injection attacks. GPT-5 blocked about 85% of attacks, showing progress yet highlighting the need for layered defenses. Findings emphasize contributions to sustainable tourism, multilingual accessibility, and ethical AI deployment. This work offers a practical framework for deploying secure chatbots in smart tourism and contributes to resilient, trustworthy AI applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 7 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

This greatly expands their abilities as various agents. However, LLMs rely entirely on the text descriptions of tools to decide which ones to use--a process that is surprisingly fragile. In this work, we expose a vulnerability in prevalent tool/function-calling protocols by investigating a series of edits to tool descriptions, some of which can drastically increase a tool's usage from LLMs when competing with alternatives. Through controlled experiments, we show that tools with properly edited descriptions receive over 10 times more usage from GPT-4.1 and Qwen2.5-7B than tools with original descriptions. We further evaluate how various edits to tool descriptions perform when competing directly with one another and how these trends generalize or differ across a broader set of 17 different models. These phenomena, while giving developers a powerful way to promote their tools, underscore the need for a more reliable foundation for agentic LLMs to select and utilize tools and resources.

These models are usually developed by optimization experts but are used by practitioners without optimization expertise in various application domains. As a result, practitioners often struggle to interact with and draw useful conclusions from optimization models independently. To fill this gap, we introduce OptiChat, a natural language dialogue system designed to help practitioners interpret model formulation, diagnose infeasibility, analyze sensitivity, retrieve information, evaluate modifications, and provide counterfactual explanations. By augmenting large language models (LLMs) with functional calls and code generation tailored for optimization models, we enable seamless interaction and minimize the risk of hallucinations in OptiChat. We develop a new dataset to evaluate OptiChat's performance in explaining optimization models. Experiments demonstrate that OptiChat effectively bridges the gap between optimization models and practitioners, delivering autonomous, accurate, and instant responses.</p></details> |  |

We propose dynamics modelling (DyMo), a method that augments LLMs with a state prediction capability alongside function calling during post-training. This enables LLMs to predict the future states of their actions through an internal environment model. On the Berkeley Function Calling Leaderboard V2, DyMo improves success rates and significantly reduces hallucinations. We further integrate the internal environment model into self-verification sampling (SVS), and show that this substantially improves pass^k over number of trials k, and allows the model to refuse unreliable outputs. Together, DyMo and SVS greatly enhance the effectiveness and reliability of LLMs for tool use. We believe this work charts a path towards scalable planning RL methods for LLM inference without repeatedly querying the oracle environment.</p></details> |  |

However, the mechanisms through which it influences model behavior remain largely under-explored. Besides, we discover that in addition to the regular usage of FC, this technique can substantially enhance the compliance of LLMs with user instructions. These observations motivate us to leverage causality, a canonical analysis method, to investigate how FC works within LLMs. In particular, we conduct layer-level and token-level causal interventions to dissect FC's impact on the model's internal computational logic when responding to user queries. Our analysis confirms the substantial influence of FC and reveals several in-depth insights into its mechanisms. To further validate our findings, we conduct extensive experiments comparing the effectiveness of FC-based instructions against conventional prompting methods. We focus on enhancing LLM safety robustness, a critical LLM application scenario, and evaluate four mainstream LLMs across two benchmark datasets. The results are striking: FC shows an average performance improvement of around 135% over conventional prompting methods in detecting malicious inputs, demonstrating its promising potential to enhance LLM reliability and capability in practical applications.</p></details> |  |

However, existing agent evaluations largely overlook cultural and linguistic diversity, often relying on monolingual or naively translated benchmarks. We introduce Ticket-Bench, a benchmark for multilingual agent evaluation in task-oriented scenarios. Ticket-Bench simulates the domain of soccer ticket purchases across six major languages: Portuguese, English, Spanish, German, Italian, and French. Using localized teams, cities, and user profiles to provide a higher level of realism. We evaluate a wide range of commercial and open-source LLMs, measuring function-calling accuracy and consistency across languages. Results show that reasoning-oriented models (e.g., GPT-5, Qwen3-235B) dominate performance but still exhibit notable cross-lingual disparities. These findings underscore the need for culturally aware, multilingual benchmarks to guide the development of robust LLM agents.</p></details> |  |

When faced with multi-step tool usage, LLMs still struggle with tool selection, parameter generation, and tool-chain planning. Existing methods typically rely on manually designing task-specific demonstrations, or retrieving from a curated library. These approaches demand substantial expert effort and prompt engineering becomes increasingly complex and inefficient as tool diversity and task difficulty scale. To address these challenges, we propose a self-guided method, Stepwise Experience Recall (SEER), which performs fine-grained, stepwise retrieval from a continually updated experience pool. Instead of relying on static or manually curated library, SEER incrementally augments the experience pool with past successful trajectories, enabling continuous expansion of the pool and improved model performance over time. Evaluated on the ToolQA benchmark, SEER achieves an average improvement of 6.1% on easy and 4.7% on hard questions. We further test SEER on $\tau$-bench, which includes two real-world domains. Powered by Qwen2.5-7B and Qwen2.5-72B models, SEER demonstrates substantial accuracy gains of 7.44% and 23.38%, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2025</p></details> |

Diverse real-world APIs demand precise, robust function-calling intelligence, which needs agents to develop these capabilities through interaction in varied environments. The breadth of function-calling competence is closely tied to the diversity of environments in which agents are trained. In this work, we scale up environments as a step towards advancing general agentic intelligence. This gives rise to two central challenges: (i) how to scale environments in a principled manner, and (ii) how to effectively train agentic capabilities from experiences derived through interactions with these environments. To address these, we design a scalable framework that automatically constructs heterogeneous environments that are fully simulated, systematically broadening the space of function-calling scenarios. We further adapt a two-phase agent fine-tuning strategy: first endowing agents with fundamental agentic capabilities, then specializing them for domain-specific contexts. Extensive experiments on agentic benchmarks, tau-bench, tau2-Bench, and ACEBench, demonstrate that our trained model, AgentScaler, significantly enhances the function-calling capability of models.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://tongyi-agent.github.io/blog/introducing-tongyi-deep-research/</p></details> |

This study aims to address these gaps by providing a comprehensive enterprise-specific benchmark evaluating 18 distinct agentic configurations across state-of-the-art large language models. We examine four critical agentic system dimensions: orchestration strategy, agent prompt implementation (ReAct versus function calling), memory architecture, and thinking tool integration. Our benchmark reveals significant model-specific architectural preferences that challenge the prevalent one-size-fits-all paradigm in agentic AI systems. It also reveals significant weaknesses in overall agentic performance on enterprise tasks with the highest scoring models achieving a maximum of only 35.3\% success on the more complex task and 70.8\% on the simpler task. We hope these findings inform the design of future agentic systems by enabling more empirically backed decisions regarding architectural components and model selection.</p></details> |  |
| **[GeoJSON Agents:A Multi-Agent LLM Architecture for Geospatial Analysis-Function Calling vs Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08863v2)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs have made substantial progress in task automation and natural language understanding. However, without expertise in GIS, they continue to encounter limitations. To address these issues, we propose GeoJSON Agents-a multi-agent LLM architecture. This framework transforms natural language tasks into structured GeoJSON operation commands and processes spatial data using two widely adopted LLM enhancement techniques: Function Calling and Code Generation. The architecture consists of three components-task parsing, agent collaboration, and result integration-aimed at enhancing both the performance and scalability of GIS automation. The Planner agent interprets natural language tasks into structured GeoJSON commands. Then, specialized Worker agents collaborate according to assigned roles to perform spatial data processing and analysis, either by invoking predefined function APIs or by dynamically generating and executing Python-based spatial analysis code. Finally, the system integrates the outputs from multiple execution rounds into reusable, standards-compliant GeoJSON files. To systematically evaluate the performance of the two approaches, we constructed a benchmark dataset of 70 tasks with varying complexity and conducted experiments using OpenAI's GPT-4o as the core model. Results indicate that the Function Calling-based GeoJSON Agent achieved an accuracy of 85.71%, while the Code Generation-based agent reached 97.14%, both significantly outperforming the best-performing general-purpose model (48.57%). Further analysis reveals that the Code Generation provides greater flexibility, whereas the Function Calling approach offers more stable execution. This study is the first to introduce an LLM multi-agent framework for GeoJSON data and to compare the strengths and limitations of two mainstream LLM enhancement methods, offering new perspectives for improving GeoAI system performance.</p></details> |  |

The ability to use tools effectively has become a defining feature of Large Language Models (LLMs), allowing them to access external data and internal resources. As AI agents grow more sophisticated, tool-use capabilities have become indispensable. While LLMs have made significant progress in this area, Small Language Models (SLMs) still face challenges in accurately integrating tool use, especially in resource-constrained settings. This study investigates how Reinforcement Learning, specifically Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), can enhance the tool-use accuracy of SLMs. By designing a well-defined reward system that reinforces structured JSON output, correct tool selection, and precise parameter usage, we demonstrate that GRPO enables SLMs to achieve significant improvements in tool-use capabilities (function calling/JSON output). Our approach provides a computationally efficient training method that enhances SLMs practical deployment in real-world AI applications.</p></details> |  |

Traditional Function Calling (FC) approaches operate statelessly, requiring multiple exploratory calls to build environmental awareness before execution, leading to inefficiency and limited error recovery. We introduce VehicleWorld, the first comprehensive environment for the automotive domain, featuring 30 modules, 250 APIs, and 680 properties with fully executable implementations that provide real-time state information during agent execution. This environment enables precise evaluation of vehicle agent behaviors across diverse, challenging scenarios. Through systematic analysis, we discovered that direct state prediction outperforms function calling for environmental control. Building on this insight, we propose State-based Function Call (SFC), a novel approach that maintains explicit system state awareness and implements direct state transitions to achieve target conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that SFC significantly outperforms traditional FC approaches, achieving superior execution accuracy and reduced latency. We have made all implementation code publicly available on Github https://github.com/OpenMOSS/VehicleWorld.</p></details> |  |
| **[GRACE: Graph-Guided Repository-Aware Code Completion through Hierarchical Code Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05980v1)** | 2025-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs excel in localized code completion but struggle with repository-level tasks due to limited context windows and complex semantic and structural dependencies across codebases. While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates context scarcity by retrieving relevant code snippets, current approaches face significant limitations. They overly rely on textual similarity for retrieval, neglecting structural relationships such as call chains and inheritance hierarchies, and lose critical structural information by naively concatenating retrieved snippets into text sequences for LLM input. To address these shortcomings, GRACE constructs a multi-level, multi-semantic code graph that unifies file structures, abstract syntax trees, function call graphs, class hierarchies, and data flow graphs to capture both static and dynamic code semantics. For retrieval, GRACE employs a Hybrid Graph Retriever that integrates graph neural network-based structural similarity with textual retrieval, refined by a graph attention network-based re-ranker to prioritize topologically relevant subgraphs. To enhance context, GRACE introduces a structural fusion mechanism that merges retrieved subgraphs with the local code context and preserves essential dependencies like function calls and inheritance. Extensive experiments on public repository-level benchmarks demonstrate that GRACE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across all metrics. Using DeepSeek-V3 as the backbone LLM, GRACE surpasses the strongest graph-based RAG baselines by 8.19% EM and 7.51% ES points on every dataset. The code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/grace_icse-C3D5.</p></details> |  |
| **[Relative-error monotonicity testing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09235v2)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The standard model of Boolean function property testing is not well suited for testing $\textit{sparse}$ functions which have few satisfying assignments, since every such function is close (in the usual Hamming distance metric) to the constant-0 function. In this work we propose and investigate a new model for property testing of Boolean functions, called $\textit{relative-error testing}$, which provides a natural framework for testing sparse functions. This new model defines the distance between two functions $f, g: \{0,1\}^n \to \{0,1\}$ to be $$\textsf{reldist}(f,g) := { \frac{|f^{-1}(1) \triangle g^{-1}(1)|} {|f^{-1}(1)|}}.$$ This is a more demanding distance measure than the usual Hamming distance ${ {|f^{-1}(1) \triangle g^{-1}(1)|}/{2^n}}$ when $|f^{-1}(1)| \ll 2^n$; to compensate for this, algorithms in the new model have access both to a black-box oracle for the function $f$ being tested and to a source of independent uniform satisfying assignments of $f$. In this paper we first give a few general results about the relative-error testing model; then, as our main technical contribution, we give a detailed study of algorithms and lower bounds for relative-error testing of $\textit{monotone}$ Boolean functions. We give upper and lower bounds which are parameterized by $N=|f^{-1}(1)|$, the sparsity of the function $f$ being tested. Our results show that there are interesting differences between relative-error monotonicity testing of sparse Boolean functions, and monotonicity testing in the standard model. These results motivate further study of the testability of Boolean function properties in the relative-error model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Updated non-adaptive lower bound argument in Section 5; results are unchanged</p></details> |

This paper presents GridMind, a multi-agent AI system that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with deterministic engineering solvers to enable conversational scientific computing for power system analysis. The system employs specialized agents coordinating AC Optimal Power Flow and N-1 contingency analysis through natural language interfaces while maintaining numerical precision via function calls. GridMind addresses workflow integration, knowledge accessibility, context preservation, and expert decision-support augmentation. Experimental evaluation on IEEE test cases demonstrates that the proposed agentic framework consistently delivers correct solutions across all tested language models, with smaller LLMs achieving comparable analytical accuracy with reduced computational latency.

This paper identifies four core problems that must be solved for mobile agents to deliver practical, scalable impact: (1) generalization across tasks, modalities, apps, and devices; (2) accuracy, specifically precise on-screen interaction and click targeting; (3) long-horizon capability for sustained, multi-step goals; and (4) efficiency, specifically high-performance runtime on resource-constrained devices. We present AppCopilot, a multimodal, multi-agent, general-purpose on-device assistant that operates across applications and constitutes a full-stack, closed-loop system from data to deployment. AppCopilot operationalizes this position through an end-to-end autonomous pipeline spanning data collection, training, deployment, high-quality and efficient inference, and mobile application development. At the model layer, it integrates multimodal foundation models with robust Chinese-English support. At the reasoning and control layer, it combines chain-of-thought reasoning, hierarchical task planning and decomposition, and multi-agent collaboration. At the execution layer, it enables user personalization and experiential adaptation, voice interaction, function calling, cross-app and cross-device orchestration, and comprehensive mobile app support. The system design incorporates profiling-driven optimization for latency, memory, and energy across heterogeneous hardware. Empirically, AppCopilot achieves significant improvements along all four dimensions: stronger generalization, higher-precision on-screen actions, more reliable long-horizon task completion, and faster, more resource-efficient runtime.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project at https://github.com/OpenBMB/AppCopilot</p></details> |

Existing methods often oversimplify programs into single level graphs, failing to model the crucial semantic relationship between high-level functional interactions and low-level instruction logic. To bridge this gap, we introduce \dataset, the largest public hierarchical graph dataset for malware analysis, comprising over \textbf{200M} Control Flow Graphs (CFGs) nested within \textbf{595K} Function Call Graphs (FCGs). This two-level representation preserves structural semantics essential for building robust detectors resilient to code obfuscation and malware evolution. We demonstrate HiGraph's utility through a large-scale analysis that reveals distinct structural properties of benign and malicious software, establishing it as a foundational benchmark for the community. The dataset and tools are publicly available at https://higraph.org.</p></details> |  |
| **[Combining Evidence Across Filtrations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09698v4)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In sequential anytime-valid inference, any admissible procedure must be based on e-processes: generalizations of test martingales that quantify the accumulated evidence against a composite null hypothesis at any stopping time. This paper proposes a method for combining e-processes constructed in different filtrations but for the same null. Although e-processes in the same filtration can be combined effortlessly (by averaging), e-processes in different filtrations cannot because their validity in a coarser filtration does not translate to a finer filtration. This issue arises in sequential tests of randomness and independence, as well as in the evaluation of sequential forecasters. We establish that a class of functions called adjusters can lift arbitrary e-processes across filtrations. The result yields a generally applicable "adjust-then-combine" procedure, which we demonstrate on the problem of testing randomness in real-world financial data. Furthermore, we prove a characterization theorem for adjusters that formalizes a sense in which using adjusters is necessary. There are two major implications. First, if we have a powerful e-process in a coarsened filtration, then we readily have a powerful e-process in the original filtration. Second, when we coarsen the filtration to construct an e-process, there is a logarithmic cost to recovering validity in the original filtration.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review.

A Study on $τ$-bench](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20931v2)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in reasoning and planning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have enabled their potential as autonomous agents capable of tool use in dynamic environments. However, in multi-turn conversational environments like $\tau$-bench, these agents often struggle with consistent reasoning, adherence to domain-specific policies, and extracting correct information over a long horizon of tool-calls and conversation. To capture and mitigate these failures, we conduct a comprehensive manual analysis of the common errors occurring in the conversation trajectories. We then experiment with reformulations of inputs to the tool-calling agent for improvement in agent decision making. Finally, we propose the Input-Reformulation Multi-Agent (IRMA) framework, which automatically reformulates user queries augmented with relevant domain rules and tool suggestions for the tool-calling agent to focus on. The results show that IRMA significantly outperforms ReAct, Function Calling, and Self-Reflection by 16.1%, 12.7%, and 19.1%, respectively, in overall pass^5 scores. These findings highlight the superior reliability and consistency of IRMA compared to other methods in dynamic environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2025 Findings</p></details> |

This measure counts the number of correctly ``interpreted" pairs of vertices, i. e. two vertices belonging to the same community and connected by an edge, or two vertices belonging to different communities and not connected by an edge. In this paper, we explore Fortunato's performance measure (fp measure) for detecting communities in unweighted, undirected networks. First, we give a greedy algorithm fpGreed that tries to optimise the fp measure by working iteratively at two-levels, vertex-level and community-level. At the vertex level, a vertex joins a community only if the fp value improves. Once this is done, an initial set of communities are obtained. At the next stage, two communities merge only if the fp measure improves. Once there are no further improvements to be made, the algorithm switches back to the vertex level and so on. fpGreed terminates when there are no changes to any community. We then present a faster heuristic algorithm fastFp more suitable for running on large datasets. We present the quality of the communities and the time it takes to compute them on several well-known datasets. For some of the large datasets, such as youtube and livejournal, we find that Algorithm fastFP performs really well, both in terms of the time and the quality of the solution obtained.</p></details> |  |

To this end, we extend transformation methods based on integer TRSs to handle arbitrary data types, global variables, function calls and arrays, as well as encode safety checks. Then we adapt existing rewriting induction methods to LCTRSs and propose a simple yet effective method to generalize equations. We show that we can automatically verify memory safety and prove correctness of realistic functions. Our approach proves equivalence between two implementations, so in contrast to other works, we do not require an explicit specification in a separate specification language.</p></details> |  |
| **[GDS Agent: A Graph Algorithmic Reasoning Agent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20637v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable multimodal information processing and reasoning ability. When equipped with tools through function calling and enhanced with retrieval-augmented techniques, compound LLM-based systems can access closed data sources and answer questions about them. However, they still struggle to process and reason over large-scale graph-structure data. We introduce the GDS (Graph Data Science) agent in this technical report. The GDS agent introduces a comprehensive set of graph algorithms as tools, together with preprocessing (retrieval) and postprocessing of algorithm results, in a model context protocol (MCP) server. The server can be used with any modern LLM out-of-the-box. GDS agent allows users to ask any question that implicitly and intrinsically requires graph algorithmic reasoning about their data, and quickly obtain accurate and grounded answers. We also introduce a new benchmark that evaluates intermediate tool calls as well as final responses. The results indicate that GDS agent is able to solve a wide spectrum of graph tasks. We also provide detailed case studies for more open-ended tasks and study scenarios where the agent struggles. Finally, we discuss the remaining challenges and the future roadmap.</p></details> | Technical report |

However, most existing approaches focus on mainstream languages such as Python and Java, neglecting the Solidity language, the predominant programming language for Ethereum smart contracts. Due to the lack of adequate benchmarks for Solidity, LLMs' ability to generate secure, cost-effective smart contracts remains unexplored. To fill this gap, we construct SolEval, the first repository-level benchmark designed for Solidity smart contract generation, to evaluate the performance of LLMs on Solidity. SolEval consists of 1,507 samples from 28 different repositories, covering 6 popular domains, providing LLMs with a comprehensive evaluation benchmark. Unlike the existing Solidity benchmark, SolEval not only includes complex function calls but also reflects the real-world complexity of the Ethereum ecosystem by incorporating Gas@k and Vul@k. We evaluate 16 LLMs on SolEval, and our results show that the best-performing LLM achieves only 26.29% Pass@10, highlighting substantial room for improvement in Solidity code generation by LLMs. Additionally, we conduct supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on Qwen-7B using SolEval, resulting in a significant performance improvement, with Pass@5 increasing from 16.67% to 58.33%, demonstrating the effectiveness of fine-tuning LLMs on our benchmark.

This report examines its three major CPU models: the AtomicSimpleCPU (AS CPU), the TimingSimpleCPU (TS CPU), the Out-of-order (O3) CPU, and their interactions with the memory subsystem. We provide a detailed anatomical overview of each CPU's function call-chains and present how gem5 partitions its execution time for each simulated hardware layer. We perform our analysis using a lightweight profiler built on Linux's perf_event interface, with user-configurable options to target specific functions and examine their interactions in detail. By profiling each CPU across a wide selection of benchmarks, we identify their software bottlenecks. Our results show that the Ruby memory subsystem consistently accounts for the largest share of execution time in the sequential AS and TS CPUs, primarily during the instruction fetch stage. In contrast, the O3 CPU spends a relatively smaller fraction of time in Ruby, with most of its time devoted to constructing instruction instances and the various pipeline stages of the CPU. We believe that the anatomical view of each CPU's execution flow is valuable for educational purposes, as it clearly illustrates the interactions among simulated components. These insights form a foundation for optimizing gem5's performance, particularly for the AS, TS, and O3 CPUs. Moreover, our framework can be readily applied to analyze other gem5 components or to develop and evaluate new models.</p></details> |  |
| **[RepoMaster: Autonomous Exploration and Understanding of GitHub Repositories for Complex Task Solving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21577v3)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ultimate goal of code agents is to solve complex tasks autonomously. Although large language models (LLMs) have made substantial progress in code generation, real-world tasks typically demand full-fledged code repositories rather than simple scripts. Building such repositories from scratch remains a major challenge. Fortunately, GitHub hosts a vast, evolving collection of open-source repositories, which developers frequently reuse as modular components for complex tasks. Yet, existing frameworks like OpenHands and SWE-Agent still struggle to effectively leverage these valuable resources. Relying solely on README files provides insufficient guidance, and deeper exploration reveals two core obstacles: overwhelming information and tangled dependencies of repositories, both constrained by the limited context windows of current LLMs. To tackle these issues, we propose RepoMaster, an autonomous agent framework designed to explore and reuse GitHub repositories for solving complex tasks. For efficient understanding, RepoMaster constructs function-call graphs, module-dependency graphs, and hierarchical code trees to identify essential components, providing only identified core elements to the LLMs rather than the entire repository. During autonomous execution, it progressively explores related components using our exploration tools and prunes information to optimize context usage. Evaluated on the adjusted MLE-bench, RepoMaster achieves a 110% relative boost in valid submissions over the strongest baseline OpenHands. On our newly released GitTaskBench, RepoMaster lifts the task-pass rate from 40.7% to 62.9% while reducing token usage by 95%.

In this paper, we trained a behavior-aligned retriever (BAR), which provides behaviorally consistent demonstrations to help LLMs make more accurate tool-using decisions. To train the BAR, we construct a corpus including different function-calling behaviors, i.e., calling or non-calling.We use the contrastive learning framework to train the BAR with customized positive/negative pairs and a dual-negative contrastive loss, ensuring robust retrieval of behaviorally consistent examples.Experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces erroneous function calls while maintaining high task performance, offering a cost-effective and efficient solution for tool-augmented LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[PowerChain: Automating Distribution Grid Analysis with Agentic AI Workflows](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17094v1)** | 2025-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the rapid pace of electrification and decarbonization, distribution grid (DG) operation and planning are becoming more complex, necessitating advanced computational analyses to ensure grid reliability and resilience. State-of-the-art DG analyses rely on disparate workflows of complex models, functions, and data pipelines, which require expert knowledge and are challenging to automate. Many small-scale utilities and cooperatives lack a large R&D workforce and therefore cannot use advanced analysis at scale. To address this gap, we develop a novel agentic AI system, PowerChain, to solve unseen DG analysis tasks via automated agentic orchestration and large language models (LLMs) function-calling. Given a natural language query, PowerChain dynamically generates and executes an ordered sequence of domain-aware functions guided by the semantics of an expert-built power systems function pool and a select reference set of known, expert-generated workflow-query pairs. Our results show that PowerChain can produce expert-level workflows with both GPT-5 and open-source Qwen models on complex, unseen DG analysis tasks operating on real utility data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Proto-Quipper with Reversing and Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22261v2)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The quantum programming language Quipper supports circuit operations such as reversing and controlling certain quantum circuits. Additionally, Quipper provides a function called with-computed, which can be used to program circuits of the form g; f; g-dagger. The latter is a common pattern in quantum circuit design. One benefit of using with-computed, as opposed to constructing the circuit g ; f; g-dagger directly from g, f, and g-dagger, is that it facilitates an important optimization. Namely, if the resulting circuit is later controlled, only f needs to be controlled; the circuits g and g-dagger need not even be controllable. In this paper, we formalize a semantics for reversible and controllable circuits, using a dagger symmetric monoidal category R to interpret reversible circuits, and a new notion we call a controllable category N, which encompasses the control and with-computed operations in Quipper. We extend the language Proto-Quipper with reversing, control and the with-computed operation. Since not all circuits are reversible and/or controllable, we use a type system with modalities to track reversibility and controllability. This generalizes the modality of Fu-Kishida-Ross-Selinger 2023. We give an abstract categorical semantics, and show that the type system and operational semantics are sound with respect to this semantics.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings QPL 2025, arXiv:2508.13619</p></details> |

Existing simulation-based data generation methods for such scenarios rely heavily on costly autoregressive interactions between multiple LLM agents, thereby limiting real-world performance of agentic tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel Non-Autoregressive Iterative Generation framework, called ToolACE-MT, for constructing high-quality multi-turn agentic dialogues. ToolACE-MT generates full conversational trajectories through three stages: coarse-grained initialization, iterative refinement, and offline verification. The initialization phase builds a structurally complete yet semantically coarse dialogue skeleton; the iterative refinement phase introduces realistic complexities and continued refinement via mask-and-fill operations; and the offline verification phase ensures correctness and coherence via rule- and model-based checks. Experiments demonstrate that ToolACE-MT enables efficient, effective and generalizable agentic data generation, offering a new paradigm for high-quality data construction in tool-augmented LLM scenarios.</p></details> |  |

In these settings, the probability distribution arises as the solution to an optimization problem that captures either static interactions among agents or the dynamic evolution of a system over time. We introduce a general methodology based on a new class of loss functions, called sharpened Fenchel-Young losses, which measure the sub-optimality gap of the optimization problem over the space of probability measures. We provide explicit stability guarantees for two relevant settings in the context of optimal transport: The first is inverse unbalanced optimal transport (iUOT) with entropic regularization, where the parameters to estimate are cost functions that govern transport computations; this method has applications such as link prediction in machine learning. The second is inverse gradient flow (iJKO), where the objective is to recover a potential function that drives the evolution of a probability distribution via the Jordan-Kinderlehrer-Otto (JKO) time-discretization scheme; this is particularly relevant for understanding cell population dynamics in single-cell genomics. We also establish source conditions to ensure stability of our method under mirror stratifiable regularizers (such as l1 or nuclear norm) that promote structure. Finally, we present optimization algorithms specifically tailored to efficiently solve iUOT and iJKO problems. We validate our approach through numerical experiments on Gaussian distributions, where closed-form solutions are available, to demonstrate the practical performance of our methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hell or High Water: Evaluating Agentic Recovery from External Failures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11027v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As language model agents are applied to real world problems of increasing complexity, they will be expected to formulate plans across large search spaces. If those plans fail for reasons beyond their control, how well do language agents search for alternative ways to achieve their goals? We devise a specialized agentic planning benchmark to study this question. Each planning problem is solved via combinations of function calls. The agent searches for relevant functions from a set of over four thousand possibilities, and observes environmental feedback in the form of function outputs or error messages. Our benchmark confronts the agent with external failures in its workflow, such as functions that suddenly become unavailable. At the same time, even with the introduction of these failures, we guarantee that the task remains solvable. Ideally, an agent's performance on the planning task should not be affected by the presence of external failures. Overall, we find that language agents struggle to formulate and execute backup plans in response to environment feedback. While state-of-the-art models are often able to identify the correct function to use in the right context, they struggle to adapt to feedback from the environment and often fail to pursue alternate courses of action, even when the search space is artificially restricted. We provide a systematic analysis of the failures of both open-source and commercial models, examining the effects of search space size, as well as the benefits of scaling model size in our setting. Our analysis identifies key challenges for current generative models as well as promising directions for future work.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to COLM 2025</p></details> |
| **[Complex Logical Instruction Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09125v1)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Instruction following has catalyzed the recent era of Large Language Models (LLMs) and is the foundational skill underpinning more advanced capabilities such as reasoning and agentic behaviors. As tasks grow more challenging, the logic structures embedded in natural language instructions becomes increasingly intricate. However, how well LLMs perform on such logic-rich instructions remains under-explored. We propose LogicIFGen and LogicIFEval. LogicIFGen is a scalable, automated framework for generating verifiable instructions from code functions, which can naturally express rich logic such as conditionals, nesting, recursion, and function calls. We further curate a collection of complex code functions and use LogicIFGen to construct LogicIFEval, a benchmark comprising 426 verifiable logic-rich instructions. Our experiments demonstrate that current state-of-the-art LLMs still struggle to correctly follow the instructions in LogicIFEval. Most LLMs can only follow fewer than 60% of the instructions, revealing significant deficiencies in the instruction-following ability.

| **[MCPToolBench++: A Large Scale AI Agent Model Context Protocol MCP Tool Use Benchmark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07575v1)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs' capabilities are enhanced by using function calls to integrate various data sources or API results into the context window. Typical tools include search, web crawlers, maps, financial data, file systems, and browser usage, etc. Integrating these data sources or functions requires a standardized method. The Model Context Protocol (MCP) provides a standardized way to supply context to LLMs. However, the evaluation of LLMs and AI Agents' MCP tool use abilities suffer from several issues. First, there's a lack of comprehensive datasets or benchmarks to evaluate various MCP tools. Second, the diverse formats of response from MCP tool call execution further increase the difficulty of evaluation. Additionally, unlike existing tool-use benchmarks with high success rates in functions like programming and math functions, the success rate of real-world MCP tool is not guaranteed and varies across different MCP servers. Furthermore, the LLMs' context window also limits the number of available tools that can be called in a single run, because the textual descriptions of tool and the parameters have long token length for an LLM to process all at once. To help address the challenges of evaluating LLMs' performance on calling MCP tools, we propose MCPToolBench++, a large-scale, multi-domain AI Agent tool use benchmark. As of July 2025, this benchmark is build upon marketplace of over 4k MCP servers from more than 40 categories, collected from the MCP marketplaces and GitHub communities. The datasets consist of both single-step and multi-step tool calls across different categories. We evaluated SOTA LLMs with agentic abilities on this benchmark and reported the results.</p></details> | <details><summary>Bench...</summary><p>Benchmarks and Source Code Released</p></details> |
| **[Mitigating Distribution Shift in Graph-Based Android Malware Classification via Function Metadata and LLM Embeddings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06734v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph-based malware classifiers can achieve over 94% accuracy on standard Android datasets, yet we find they suffer accuracy drops of up to 45% when evaluated on previously unseen malware variants from the same family - a scenario where strong generalization would typically be expected. This highlights a key limitation in existing approaches: both the model architectures and their structure-only representations often fail to capture deeper semantic patterns. In this work, we propose a robust semantic enrichment framework that enhances function call graphs with contextual features, including function-level metadata and, when available, code embeddings derived from large language models. The framework is designed to operate under real-world constraints where feature availability is inconsistent, and supports flexible integration of semantic signals. To evaluate generalization under realistic domain and temporal shifts, we introduce two new benchmarks: MalNet-Tiny-Common and MalNet-Tiny-Distinct, constructed using malware family partitioning to simulate cross-family generalization and evolving threat behavior. Experiments across multiple graph neural network backbones show that our method improves classification performance by up to 8% under distribution shift and consistently enhances robustness when integrated with adaptation-based methods. These results offer a practical path toward building resilient malware detection systems in evolving threat environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 3 figures, 7 tables, under review</p></details> |
| **[CodeARC: Benchmarking Reasoning Capabilities of LLM Agents for Inductive Program Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23145v2)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inductive program synthesis, or programming by example, requires synthesizing functions from input-output examples that generalize to unseen inputs. While large language model agents have shown promise in programming tasks guided by natural language, their ability to perform inductive program synthesis is underexplored. Existing evaluation protocols rely on static sets of examples and held-out tests, offering no feedback when synthesized functions are incorrect and failing to reflect real-world scenarios such as reverse engineering. We propose CodeARC, the Code Abstraction and Reasoning Challenge, a new evaluation framework where agents interact with a hidden target function by querying it with new inputs, synthesizing candidate functions, and iteratively refining their solutions using a differential testing oracle. This interactive setting encourages agents to perform function calls and self-correction based on feedback. We construct the first large-scale benchmark for general-purpose inductive program synthesis, featuring 1114 functions. Among 18 models evaluated, o3-mini performs best with a success rate of 52.7%, highlighting the difficulty of this task. Fine-tuning LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct on curated synthesis traces yields up to a 31% relative performance gain. CodeARC provides a more realistic and challenging testbed for evaluating LLM-based program synthesis and inductive reasoning. Our code, data, and models are publicly available at https://github.com/Anjiang-Wei/CodeARC</p></details> |  |

In contrast to conventional methods that rely on pre-scheduled action sequences or behavior trees, GhostShell drives embodied systems to act on-the-fly by issuing function calls incrementally as tokens are streamed from the LLM. GhostShell features a streaming XML function token parser, a dynamic function interface mapper, and a multi-channel scheduler that orchestrates intra-channel synchronous and inter-channel asynchronous function calls, thereby coordinating serial-parallel embodied actions across multiple robotic components under LLM guidance. We evaluate GhostShell on our robotic prototype COCO through comprehensive grounded experiments across 34 real-world interaction tasks and multiple LLM backends. The results demonstrate that our approach achieves a state-of-the-art Behavioral Correctness Metric of 0.85 with Claude-4-Sonnet, and up to 66X faster response times compared to native LLM function calling APIs. GhostShell also proves effective in long-horizon multimodal tasks, exhibiting strong robustness and generalization capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 5 figures, conference</p></details> |
| **[Calibrating Deep Neural Network using Euclidean Distance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18321v2)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Uncertainty is a fundamental aspect of real-world scenarios, where perfect information is rarely available. Humans naturally develop complex internal models to navigate incomplete data and effectively respond to unforeseen or partially observed events. In machine learning, Focal Loss is commonly used to reduce misclassification rates by emphasizing hard-to-classify samples. However, it does not guarantee well-calibrated predicted probabilities and may result in models that are overconfident or underconfident. High calibration error indicates a misalignment between predicted probabilities and actual outcomes, affecting model reliability. This research introduces a novel loss function called Focal Calibration Loss (FCL), designed to improve probability calibration while retaining the advantages of Focal Loss in handling difficult samples. By minimizing the Euclidean norm through a strictly proper loss, FCL penalizes the instance-wise calibration error and constrains bounds. We provide theoretical validation for proposed method and apply it to calibrate CheXNet for potential deployment in web-based health-care systems. Extensive evaluations on various models and datasets demonstrate that our method achieves SOTA performance in both calibration and accuracy metrics.</p></details> | V2 |

Although deep learning models are prevalent in stock recommendation systems, traditional time-series forecasting training often fails to capture stock trends and rankings simultaneously, which are essential consideration factors for investors. To tackle this issue, we introduce a Multi-Task Learning (MTL) framework for stock recommendation, \textbf{M}omentum-\textbf{i}ntegrated \textbf{M}ulti-task \textbf{Stoc}k \textbf{R}ecommendation with Converge-based Optimization (\textbf{MiM-StocR}). To improve the model's ability to capture short-term trends, we novelly invoke a momentum line indicator in model training. To prioritize top-performing stocks and optimize investment allocation, we propose a list-wise ranking loss function called Adaptive-k ApproxNDCG. Moreover, due to the volatility and uncertainty of the stock market, existing MTL frameworks face overfitting issues when applied to stock time series. To mitigate this issue, we introduce the Converge-based Quad-Balancing (CQB) method. We conducted extensive experiments on three stock benchmarks: SEE50, CSI 100, and CSI 300. MiM-StocR outperforms state-of-the-art MTL baselines across both ranking and profitable evaluations.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |

We address this challenge by proposing a unified approach to tool integration that abstracts protocol differences while optimizing execution performance. Our solution demonstrates how protocol-agnostic design principles can significantly reduce development overhead through automated schema generation, dual-mode concurrent execution, and seamless multi-source tool management. Experimental results show 60-80% code reduction across integration scenarios, performance improvements up to 3.1x through optimized concurrency, and full compatibility with existing function calling standards. This work contributes both theoretical insights into tool integration architecture and practical solutions for real-world LLM application development.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2507.10593</p></details> |

Among these, program-guided reasoning, by decomposing claims into function calls and executing reasoning programs, which has shown particular promise, but remains limited by the need for manually crafted demonstrations. Fundamentally, the underlying principles of effective reasoning program generation still remain underexplored. In this work, we introduce BOOST, a bootstrapping approach for automated few-shot reasoning program generation. BOOST iteratively refines explicit, data-driven guidelines as meta-rules for guiding demonstration creation, using a critique-refine loop that eliminates the need for human intervention. This enables a seamless transition from zero-shot to few-shot program-guided learning, enhancing interpretability and effectiveness. Experimental results show that BOOST outperforms prior few-shot baselines in both zero-shot and few-shot settings for complex claim verification.</p></details> | Work in Progress |
| **[Efficient algorithm for linear diophantine equations in two variables](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23216v1)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Solving linear diophantine equations in two variables have applications in computer science and mathematics. In this paper, we revisit an algorithm for solving linear diophantine equations in two variables, which we refer as DEA-R algorithm. The DEA-R algorithm always incurs equal or less number of recursions or recursive calls as compared to extended euclidean algorithm. With the objective of taking advantage of the less number of recursive calls , we propose an optimized version of the DEA-R algorithm as DEA-OPTD. In the recursive function calls in DEA-OPTD, we propose a sequence of more efficient computations. We do a theoretical comparison of the execution times of DEA-OPTD algorithm and DEA-R algorithm to find any possible bound on the value of $c$ for DEA-OPTD being better than DEA-R. We implement and compare an iterative version of DEA-OPTD (DEA-OPTDI) with two versions of a widely used algorithm on an specific input setting. In this comparison, we find out that our algorithm outperforms on the other algorithm against atleast 96% of the inputs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Kernel-FFI: Transparent Foreign Function Interfaces for Interactive Notebooks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23205v1)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foreign Function Interfaces (FFIs) are essential for enabling interoperability between programming languages, yet existing FFI solutions are ill-suited for the dynamic, interactive workflows prevalent in modern notebook environments such as Jupyter. Current approaches require extensive manual configuration, introduce significant boilerplate, and often lack support for recursive calls and object-oriented programming (OOP) constructs-features critical for productive, multi-language development. We present Kernel-FFI, a transparent, language-agnostic framework that enables seamless cross-language function calls and object manipulation within interactive notebooks. Kernel-FFI employs source-level transformation to automatically rewrite cross-language invocations, eliminating the need for manual bindings or boilerplate. Kernel-FFI provides robust support for OOP by enabling foreign object referencing and automatic resource management across language boundaries. Furthermore, to address the blocking nature of Jupyter kernels and support recursive and asynchronous foreign calls, we introduce a novel side-channel communication mechanism. Our tool will be open-sourced and available at https://codepod.io/docs/kernel-ffi</p></details> |  |
| **[MIMII-Agent: Leveraging LLMs with Function Calling for Relative Evaluation of Anomalous Sound Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20666v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a method for generating machine-type-specific anomalies to evaluate the relative performance of unsupervised anomalous sound detection (UASD) systems across different machine types, even in the absence of real anomaly sound data. Conventional keyword-based data augmentation methods often produce unrealistic sounds due to their reliance on manually defined labels, limiting scalability as machine types and anomaly patterns diversify. Advanced audio generative models, such as MIMII-Gen, show promise but typically depend on anomalous training data, making them less effective when diverse anomalous examples are unavailable. To address these limitations, we propose a novel synthesis approach leveraging large language models (LLMs) to interpret textual descriptions of faults and automatically select audio transformation functions, converting normal machine sounds into diverse and plausible anomalous sounds. We validate this approach by evaluating a UASD system trained only on normal sounds from five machine types, using both real and synthetic anomaly data. Experimental results reveal consistent trends in relative detection difficulty across machine types between synthetic and real anomalies. This finding supports our hypothesis and highlights the effectiveness of the proposed LLM-based synthesis approach for relative evaluation of UASD systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[DrugPilot: LLM-based Parameterized Reasoning Agent for Drug Discovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13940v2)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) integrated with autonomous agents hold significant potential for advancing scientific discovery through automated reasoning and task execution. However, applying LLM agents to drug discovery is still constrained by challenges such as large-scale multimodal data processing, limited task automation, and poor support for domain-specific tools. To overcome these limitations, we introduce DrugPilot, a LLM-based agent system with a parameterized reasoning architecture designed for end-to-end scientific workflows in drug discovery. DrugPilot enables multi-stage research processes by integrating structured tool use with a novel parameterized memory pool. The memory pool converts heterogeneous data from both public sources and user-defined inputs into standardized representations. This design supports efficient multi-turn dialogue, reduces information loss during data exchange, and enhances complex scientific decision-making. To support training and benchmarking, we construct a drug instruction dataset covering eight core drug discovery tasks. Under the Berkeley function-calling benchmark, DrugPilot significantly outperforms state-of-the-art agents such as ReAct and LoT, achieving task completion rates of 98.0%, 93.5%, and 64.0% for simple, multi-tool, and multi-turn scenarios, respectively. These results highlight DrugPilot's potential as a versatile agent framework for computational science domains requiring automated, interactive, and data-integrated reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 8 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[MazeEval: A Benchmark for Testing Sequential Decision-Making in Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20395v1)** | 2025-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly power autonomous agents in robotics and embodied AI, understanding their spatial reasoning capabilities becomes crucial for ensuring reliable real-world deployment. Despite advances in language understanding, current research lacks evaluation of how LLMs perform spatial navigation without visual cues, a fundamental requirement for agents operating with limited sensory information. This paper addresses this gap by introducing MazeEval, a benchmark designed to isolate and evaluate pure spatial reasoning in LLMs through coordinate-based maze navigation tasks. Our methodology employs a function-calling interface where models navigate mazes of varying complexity ($5\times 5$ to $15\times 15$ grids) using only coordinate feedback and distance-to-wall information, excluding visual input to test fundamental spatial cognition. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art LLMs across identical mazes in both English and Icelandic to assess cross-linguistic transfer of spatial abilities. Our findings reveal striking disparities: while OpenAI's O3 achieves perfect navigation for mazes up to size $30\times 30$, other models exhibit catastrophic failure beyond $9\times 9$ mazes, with 100% of failures attributed to excessive looping behavior where models revisit a cell at least 10 times. We document a significant performance degradation in Icelandic, with models solving mazes 3-4 sizes smaller than in English, suggesting spatial reasoning in LLMs emerges from linguistic patterns rather than language-agnostic mechanisms. These results have important implications for global deployment of LLM-powered autonomous systems, showing spatial intelligence remains fundamentally constrained by training data availability and highlighting the need for architectural innovations to achieve reliable navigation across linguistic contexts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automated Synthesis of Formally Verified Multi-Abstraction Function Summaries](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09550v3)** | 2025-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Function summaries, which characterize the behavior of code segments (typically functions) through preconditions and postconditions, are essential for understanding, reusing, and verifying software, particularly in safety-critical domains like aerospace embedded systems. However, these mission-critical legacy code serving as a valuable reused asset often lacks formal specifications. It is challenging to automatically generate function summaries for C programs, due to the existence of complex features such as loops, nested function calls, pointer aliasing, and so on. Moreover, function summaries should support multiple abstraction levels to meet diverse requirements, e.g. precise summaries capturing full functionality for formal verification and intuitive summaries for human understanding. To address these challenges, we first propose a novel framework that combines symbolic execution, large language models (LLMs), and formal verification to generate Relatively Strongest Postconditions (RSPs) and build function summaries that fully capture program behavior. Our approach leverages VST-A's symbolic execution to precisely track program execution paths and state transitions, employs LLMs to infer loop invariants based on predefined templates, and uses Frama-C to guarantee soundness of generated summaries in an iterative refinement loop. Furthermore, from generated RSPs, we automatically synthesize strongest non-redundant postconditions expressed within given domain specific language. We compare our approach with existing work through extensive experiments.</p></details> |  |

However, despite with intrinsic world knowledge, their application on structured tabular data prediction still lags behind, primarily due to the numerical insensitivity and modality discrepancy that brings a gap between LLM reasoning and statistical tabular learning. Unlike textual or vision data (e.g., electronic clinical notes or medical imaging data), tabular data is often presented in heterogeneous numerical values (e.g., CBC reports). This ubiquitous data format requires intensive expert annotation, and its numerical nature limits LLMs' capability to effectively transfer untapped domain expertise. In this paper, we propose SERSAL, a general self-prompting method by synergy learning with small models to enhance LLM tabular prediction in an unsupervised manner. Specifically, SERSAL utilizes the LLM's prior outcomes as original soft noisy annotations, which are dynamically leveraged to teach a better small student model. Reversely, the outcomes from the trained small model are used to teach the LLM to further refine its real capability. This process can be repeatedly applied to gradually distill refined knowledge for continuous progress. Comprehensive experiments on widely used medical domain tabular datasets show that, without access to gold labels, applying SERSAL to OpenAI GPT reasoning process attains substantial improvement compared to linguistic prompting methods, which serves as an orthogonal direction for tabular LLM, and increasing prompting bonus is observed as more powerful LLMs appear.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025.

In this work, we address this concern for tabular data. Specifically, we introduce a variety of different techniques to assess whether a language model has seen a tabular dataset during training. This investigation reveals that LLMs have memorized many popular tabular datasets verbatim. We then compare the few-shot learning performance of LLMs on datasets that were seen during training to the performance on datasets released after training. We find that LLMs perform better on datasets seen during training, indicating that memorization leads to overfitting. At the same time, LLMs show non-trivial performance on novel datasets and are surprisingly robust to data transformations. We then investigate the in-context statistical learning abilities of LLMs. While LLMs are significantly better than random at solving statistical classification problems, the sample efficiency of few-shot learning lags behind traditional statistical learning algorithms, especially as the dimension of the problem increases. This suggests that much of the observed few-shot performance on novel real-world datasets is due to the LLM's world knowledge. Overall, our results highlight the importance of testing whether an LLM has seen an evaluation dataset during pre-training. We release the https://github.com/interpretml/LLM-Tabular-Memorization-Checker Python package to test LLMs for memorization of tabular datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>COLM ...</summary><p>COLM camera ready, fix typo</p></details> |

Since it is impossible to generalize to a completely new and unknown domain, we study models that are easy to adapt to the target domain even with few labeled examples. We focus on building more informative representations of tabular data that can mitigate $Y|X$-shifts, and propose to leverage the prior world knowledge in LLMs by serializing (write down) the tabular data to encode it. We find LLM embeddings alone provide inconsistent improvements in robustness, but models trained on them can be well adapted/finetuned to the target domain even using 32 labeled observations. Our finding is based on a comprehensive and systematic study consisting of 7650 source-target pairs and benchmark against 261,000 model configurations trained by 22 algorithms. Our observation holds when ablating the size of accessible target data and different adaptation strategies. The code is available at https://github.com/namkoong-lab/LLM-Tabular-Shifts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Elephants Never Forget: Testing Language Models for Memorization of Tabular Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06644v1)** | 2024-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While many have shown how Large Language Models (LLMs) can be applied to a diverse set of tasks, the critical issues of data contamination and memorization are often glossed over. In this work, we address this concern for tabular data. Starting with simple qualitative tests for whether an LLM knows the names and values of features, we introduce a variety of different techniques to assess the degrees of contamination, including statistical tests for conditional distribution modeling and four tests that identify memorization. Our investigation reveals that LLMs are pre-trained on many popular tabular datasets. This exposure can lead to invalid performance evaluation on downstream tasks because the LLMs have, in effect, been fit to the test set. Interestingly, we also identify a regime where the language model reproduces important statistics of the data, but fails to reproduce the dataset verbatim. On these datasets, although seen during training, good performance on downstream tasks might not be due to overfitting. Our findings underscore the need for ensuring data integrity in machine learning tasks with LLMs. To facilitate future research, we release an open-source tool that can perform various tests for memorization \url{https://github.com/interpretml/LLM-Tabular-Memorization-Checker}.</p></details> | <details><summary>Table...</summary><p>Table Representation Learning Workshop at NeurIPS 2023</p></details> |
