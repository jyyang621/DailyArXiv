| **[LemmaHead: RAG Assisted Proof Generation Using Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15797v3)** | 2025-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developing the logic necessary to solve mathematical problems or write mathematical proofs is one of the more difficult objectives for large language models (LLMS). Currently, the most popular methods in literature consists of fine-tuning the model on written mathematical content such as academic publications and textbooks, so that the model can learn to emulate the style of mathematical writing. In this project, we explore the effectiveness of using retrieval augmented generation (RAG) to address gaps in the mathematical reasoning of LLMs. We develop LemmaHead, a RAG knowledge base that supplements queries to the model with relevant mathematical context, with particular focus on context from published textbooks. To measure our model's performance in mathematical reasoning, our testing paradigm focuses on the task of automated theorem proving via generating proofs to a given mathematical claim in the Lean formal language.</p></details> |  |

Typically, such RAG systems retrieve search results, download HTML sources of the results, and then extract plain texts from the HTML sources. Plain text documents or chunks are fed into the LLMs to augment the generation. However, much of the structural and semantic information inherent in HTML, such as headings and table structures, is lost during this plain-text-based RAG process. To alleviate this problem, we propose HtmlRAG, which uses HTML instead of plain text as the format of retrieved knowledge in RAG. We believe HTML is better than plain text in modeling knowledge in external documents, and most LLMs possess robust capacities to understand HTML. However, utilizing HTML presents new challenges. HTML contains additional content such as tags, JavaScript, and CSS specifications, which bring extra input tokens and noise to the RAG system. To address this issue, we propose HTML cleaning, compression, and a two-step block-tree-based pruning strategy, to shorten the HTML while minimizing the loss of information. Experiments on six QA datasets confirm the superiority of using HTML in RAG systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by WWW 2025 main conference.

| **[Enhancing Health Information Retrieval with RAG by Prioritizing Topical Relevance and Factual Accuracy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04666v1)** | 2025-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The exponential surge in online health information, coupled with its increasing use by non-experts, highlights the pressing need for advanced Health Information Retrieval models that consider not only topical relevance but also the factual accuracy of the retrieved information, given the potential risks associated with health misinformation. To this aim, this paper introduces a solution driven by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which leverages the capabilities of generative Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance the retrieval of health-related documents grounded in scientific evidence. In particular, we propose a three-stage model: in the first stage, the user's query is employed to retrieve topically relevant passages with associated references from a knowledge base constituted by scientific literature. In the second stage, these passages, alongside the initial query, are processed by LLMs to generate a contextually relevant rich text (GenText). In the last stage, the documents to be retrieved are evaluated and ranked both from the point of view of topical relevance and factual accuracy by means of their comparison with GenText, either through stance detection or semantic similarity. In addition to calculating factual accuracy, GenText can offer a layer of explainability for it, aiding users in understanding the reasoning behind the retrieval. Experimental evaluation of our model on benchmark datasets and against baseline models demonstrates its effectiveness in enhancing the retrieval of both topically relevant and factually accurate health information, thus presenting a significant step forward in the health misinformation mitigation problem.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Online Learning Efficiency Through Heterogeneous Resource Integration with a Multi-Agent RAG System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03948v1)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient online learning requires seamless access to diverse resources such as videos, code repositories, documentation, and general web content. This poster paper introduces early-stage work on a Multi-Agent Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System designed to enhance learning efficiency by integrating these heterogeneous resources. Using specialized agents tailored for specific resource types (e.g., YouTube tutorials, GitHub repositories, documentation websites, and search engines), the system automates the retrieval and synthesis of relevant information. By streamlining the process of finding and combining knowledge, this approach reduces manual effort and enhances the learning experience. A preliminary user study confirmed the system's strong usability and moderate-high utility, demonstrating its potential to improve the efficiency of knowledge acquisition.</p></details> |  |
| **[Plan*RAG: Efficient Test-Time Planning for Retrieval Augmented Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20753v2)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Plan*RAG, a novel framework that enables structured multi-hop reasoning in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) through test-time reasoning plan generation. While existing approaches such as ReAct maintain reasoning chains within the language model's context window, we observe that this often leads to plan fragmentation and execution failures. Our key insight is that by isolating the reasoning plan as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) outside the LM's working memory, we can enable (1) systematic exploration of reasoning paths, (2) atomic subqueries enabling precise retrievals and grounding, and (3) efficiency through parallel execution and bounded context window utilization. Moreover, Plan*RAG's modular design allows it to be integrated with existing RAG methods, thus providing a practical solution to improve current RAG systems. On standard multi-hop reasoning benchmarks, Plan*RAG consistently achieves improvements over recently proposed methods such as RQ-RAG and Self-RAG, while maintaining comparable computational costs.</p></details> | 19 pages, preprint |
| **[Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation: A Survey on Agentic RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09136v3)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized artificial intelligence (AI) by enabling human like text generation and natural language understanding. However, their reliance on static training data limits their ability to respond to dynamic, real time queries, resulting in outdated or inaccurate outputs. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a solution, enhancing LLMs by integrating real time data retrieval to provide contextually relevant and up-to-date responses. Despite its promise, traditional RAG systems are constrained by static workflows and lack the adaptability required for multistep reasoning and complex task management. Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Agentic RAG) transcends these limitations by embedding autonomous AI agents into the RAG pipeline. These agents leverage agentic design patterns reflection, planning, tool use, and multiagent collaboration to dynamically manage retrieval strategies, iteratively refine contextual understanding, and adapt workflows to meet complex task requirements. This integration enables Agentic RAG systems to deliver unparalleled flexibility, scalability, and context awareness across diverse applications. This survey provides a comprehensive exploration of Agentic RAG, beginning with its foundational principles and the evolution of RAG paradigms. It presents a detailed taxonomy of Agentic RAG architectures, highlights key applications in industries such as healthcare, finance, and education, and examines practical implementation strategies. Additionally, it addresses challenges in scaling these systems, ensuring ethical decision making, and optimizing performance for real-world applications, while providing detailed insights into frameworks and tools for implementing Agentic RAG.</p></details> |  |
| **[Addressing Hallucinations with RAG and NMISS in Italian Healthcare LLM Chatbots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04235v2)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>I combine detection and mitigation techniques to addresses hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs). Mitigation is achieved in a question-answering Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework while detection is obtained by introducing the Negative Missing Information Scoring System (NMISS), which accounts for contextual relevance in responses. While RAG mitigates hallucinations by grounding answers in external data, NMISS refines the evaluation by identifying cases where traditional metrics incorrectly flag contextually accurate responses as hallucinations. I use Italian health news articles as context to evaluate LLM performance. Results show that Gemma2 and GPT-4 outperform the other models, with GPT-4 producing answers closely aligned with reference responses. Mid-tier models, such as Llama2, Llama3, and Mistral benefit significantly from NMISS, highlighting their ability to provide richer contextual information. This combined approach offers new insights into the reduction and more accurate assessment of hallucinations in LLMs, with applications in real-world healthcare tasks and other domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging LLM Agents for Automated Optimization Modeling for SASP Problems: A Graph-RAG based Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18320v1)** | 2025-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated optimization modeling (AOM) has evoked considerable interest with the rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs). Existing approaches predominantly rely on prompt engineering, utilizing meticulously designed expert response chains or structured guidance. However, prompt-based techniques have failed to perform well in the sensor array signal processing (SASP) area due the lack of specific domain knowledge. To address this issue, we propose an automated modeling approach based on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) technique, which consists of two principal components: a multi-agent (MA) structure and a graph-based RAG (Graph-RAG) process. The MA structure is tailored for the architectural AOM process, with each agent being designed based on principles of human modeling procedure. The Graph-RAG process serves to match user query with specific SASP modeling knowledge, thereby enhancing the modeling result. Results on ten classical signal processing problems demonstrate that the proposed approach (termed as MAG-RAG) outperforms several AOM benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[URAG: Implementing a Unified Hybrid RAG for Precise Answers in University Admission Chatbots -- A Case Study at HCMUT](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16276v1)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence, particularly in Natural Language Processing, Large Language Models (LLMs) have become pivotal in educational question-answering systems, especially university admission chatbots. Concepts such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and other advanced techniques have been developed to enhance these systems by integrating specific university data, enabling LLMs to provide informed responses on admissions and academic counseling. However, these enhanced RAG techniques often involve high operational costs and require the training of complex, specialized modules, which poses challenges for practical deployment. Additionally, in the educational context, it is crucial to provide accurate answers to prevent misinformation, a task that LLM-based systems find challenging without appropriate strategies and methods. In this paper, we introduce the Unified RAG (URAG) Framework, a hybrid approach that significantly improves the accuracy of responses, particularly for critical queries. Experimental results demonstrate that URAG enhances our in-house, lightweight model to perform comparably to state-of-the-art commercial models. Moreover, to validate its practical applicability, we conducted a case study at our educational institution, which received positive feedback and acclaim. This study not only proves the effectiveness of URAG but also highlights its feasibility for real-world implementation in educational settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review at SoICT'24</p></details> |
| **[Long$^2$RAG: Evaluating Long-Context & Long-Form Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Key Point Recall](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23000v3)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a promising approach to address the limitations of fixed knowledge in large language models (LLMs). However, current benchmarks for evaluating RAG systems suffer from two key deficiencies: (1) they fail to adequately measure LLMs' capability in handling long-context retrieval due to a lack of datasets that reflect the characteristics of retrieved documents, and (2) they lack a comprehensive evaluation method for assessing LLMs' ability to generate long-form responses that effectively exploits retrieved information. To address these shortcomings, we introduce the Long$^2$RAG benchmark and the Key Point Recall (KPR) metric. Long$^2$RAG comprises 280 questions spanning 10 domains and across 8 question categories, each associated with 5 retrieved documents with an average length of 2,444 words. KPR evaluates the extent to which LLMs incorporate key points extracted from the retrieved documents into their generated responses, providing a more nuanced assessment of their ability to exploit retrieved information.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP'24 (Findings).

| **[Advanced Real-Time Fraud Detection Using RAG-Based LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15290v1)** | 2025-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial Intelligence has become a double edged sword in modern society being both a boon and a bane. While it empowers individuals it also enables malicious actors to perpetrate scams such as fraudulent phone calls and user impersonations. This growing threat necessitates a robust system to protect individuals In this paper we introduce a novel real time fraud detection mechanism using Retrieval Augmented Generation technology to address this challenge on two fronts. First our system incorporates a continuously updating policy checking feature that transcribes phone calls in real time and uses RAG based models to verify that the caller is not soliciting private information thus ensuring transparency and the authenticity of the conversation. Second we implement a real time user impersonation check with a two step verification process to confirm the callers identity ensuring accountability. A key innovation of our system is the ability to update policies without retraining the entire model enhancing its adaptability. We validated our RAG based approach using synthetic call recordings achieving an accuracy of 97.98 percent and an F1score of 97.44 percent with 100 calls outperforming state of the art methods. This robust and flexible fraud detection system is well suited for real world deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[A RAG-Based Institutional Assistant](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13880v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong text generation capabilities, they struggle in scenarios requiring access to structured knowledge bases or specific documents, limiting their effectiveness in knowledge-intensive tasks. To address this limitation, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) models have been developed, enabling generative models to incorporate relevant document fragments into their inputs. In this paper, we design and evaluate a RAG-based virtual assistant specifically tailored for the University of S\~ao Paulo. Our system architecture comprises two key modules: a retriever and a generative model. We experiment with different types of models for both components, adjusting hyperparameters such as chunk size and the number of retrieved documents. Our optimal retriever model achieves a Top-5 accuracy of 30%, while our most effective generative model scores 22.04\% against ground truth answers. Notably, when the correct document chunks are supplied to the LLMs, accuracy significantly improves to 54.02%, an increase of over 30 percentage points. Conversely, without contextual input, performance declines to 13.68%. These findings highlight the critical role of database access in enhancing LLM performance. They also reveal the limitations of current semantic search methods in accurately identifying relevant documents and underscore the ongoing challenges LLMs face in generating precise responses.</p></details> |  |
| **[Parallel Key-Value Cache Fusion for Position Invariant RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07523v2)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) underscore the necessity of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to leverage external information. However, LLMs are sensitive to the position of relevant information within contexts and tend to generate incorrect responses when such information is placed in the middle, known as `Lost in the Middle' phenomenon. In this paper, we introduce a framework that generates consistent outputs for decoder-only models, irrespective of the input context order. Experimental results for three open domain question answering tasks demonstrate position invariance, where the model is not sensitive to input context order, and superior robustness to irrelevent passages compared to prevailing approaches for RAG pipelines.</p></details> | 5 pages |
| **[FunnelRAG: A Coarse-to-Fine Progressive Retrieval Paradigm for RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10293v2)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) prevails in Large Language Models. It mainly consists of retrieval and generation. The retrieval modules (a.k.a. retrievers) aim to find useful information used to facilitate generation modules (a.k.a. generators). As such, generators' performance largely depends on the effectiveness and efficiency of retrievers. However, the retrieval paradigm that we design and use remains flat, which treats the retrieval procedures as a one-off deal with constant granularity. Despite effectiveness, we argue that they suffer from two limitations: (1) flat retrieval exerts a significant burden on one retriever; (2) constant granularity limits the ceiling of retrieval performance. In this work, we propose a progressive retrieval paradigm with coarse-to-fine granularity for RAG, termed FunnelRAG, so as to balance effectiveness and efficiency. Specifically, FunnelRAG establishes a progressive retrieval pipeline by collaborating coarse-to-fine granularity, large-to-small quantity, and low-to-high capacity, which can relieve the burden on one retriever and also promote the ceiling of retrieval performance. Extensive experiments manifest that FunnelRAG achieves comparable retrieval performance while the time overhead is reduced by nearly 40 percent.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 6 figures, 13 tables.

| **[RAG-Reward: Optimizing RAG with Reward Modeling and RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13264v1)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) with relevant and up-to-date knowledge, improving their ability to answer knowledge-intensive questions. It has been shown to enhance both generation quality and trustworthiness. While numerous works have focused on improving retrieval, generation, and evaluation, the role of reward models in reinforcement learning for optimizing RAG and establishing automated benchmarking pipelines remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{RAG-Reward}, a dataset designed to enable \textit{hallucination-free, comprehensive, reliable, and efficient RAG}. We define four key metrics for assessing generation quality and develop an automated annotation pipeline that leverages multiple LLMs to generate outputs across diverse RAG scenarios. GPT-4o is used to evaluate and construct preference data. Using \textbf{RAG-Reward}, we train reward models and apply reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) to improve LLMs' effectiveness in RAG. Experimental results show that our reward model achieves state-of-the-art performance on a held-out test set, demonstrating both the effectiveness of our approach and the quality of our dataset. Furthermore, the improved generation quality of the trained policy model highlights the feasibility of using RLHF to enhance RAG pipelines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint, work in progress</p></details> |
| **[Towards Interpretable Radiology Report Generation via Concept Bottlenecks using a Multi-Agentic RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16086v2)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning has advanced medical image classification, but interpretability challenges hinder its clinical adoption. This study enhances interpretability in Chest X-ray (CXR) classification by using concept bottleneck models (CBMs) and a multi-agent Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for report generation. By modeling relationships between visual features and clinical concepts, we create interpretable concept vectors that guide a multi-agent RAG system to generate radiology reports, enhancing clinical relevance, explainability, and transparency. Evaluation of the generated reports using an LLM-as-a-judge confirmed the interpretability and clinical utility of our model's outputs. On the COVID-QU dataset, our model achieved 81% classification accuracy and demonstrated robust report generation performance, with five key metrics ranging between 84% and 90%. This interpretable multi-agent framework bridges the gap between high-performance AI and the explainability required for reliable AI-driven CXR analysis in clinical settings.

| **[RAG with Differential Privacy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19291v2)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as the dominant technique to provide \emph{Large Language Models} (LLM) with fresh and relevant context, mitigating the risk of hallucinations and improving the overall quality of responses in environments with large and fast moving knowledge bases. However, the integration of external documents into the generation process raises significant privacy concerns. Indeed, when added to a prompt, it is not possible to guarantee a response will not inadvertently expose confidential data, leading to potential breaches of privacy and ethical dilemmas. This paper explores a practical solution to this problem suitable to general knowledge extraction from personal data. It shows \emph{differentially private token generation} is a viable approach to private RAG.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generating Diverse Q&A Benchmarks for RAG Evaluation with DataMorgana](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12789v1)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, especially in domain-specific contexts, requires benchmarks that address the distinctive requirements of the applicative scenario. Since real data can be hard to obtain, a common strategy is to use LLM-based methods to generate synthetic data. Existing solutions are general purpose: given a document, they generate a question to build a Q&A pair. However, although the generated questions can be individually good, they are typically not diverse enough to reasonably cover the different ways real end-users can interact with the RAG system. We introduce here DataMorgana, a tool for generating highly customizable and diverse synthetic Q&A benchmarks tailored to RAG applications. DataMorgana enables detailed configurations of user and question categories and provides control over their distribution within the benchmark. It uses a lightweight two-stage process, ensuring efficiency and fast iterations, while generating benchmarks that reflect the expected traffic. We conduct a thorough line of experiments, showing quantitatively and qualitatively that DataMorgana surpasses existing tools and approaches in producing lexically, syntactically, and semantically diverse question sets across domain-specific and general-knowledge corpora. DataMorgana will be made available to selected teams in the research community, as first beta testers, in the context of the upcoming SIGIR'2025 LiveRAG challenge to be announced in early February 2025.</p></details> |  |

By integrating knowledge graphs with retrieval-augmented generation, KG-RAG provides a structured representation of course concepts and their relationships, enabling contextually grounded and pedagogically sound responses. We implement the framework using Qwen2.5, demonstrating its cost-effectiveness while maintaining high performance. The KG-RAG system outperformed standard RAG-based tutoring in a controlled study with 76 university students (mean scores: 6.37 vs. 4.71, p<0.001, Cohen's d=0.86). User feedback showed strong satisfaction with answer relevance (84% positive) and user experience (59% positive). Our framework offers a scalable approach to personalized AI tutoring, ensuring response accuracy and pedagogical coherence.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Machine Against the RAG: Jamming Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Blocker Documents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05870v3)** | 2025-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems respond to queries by retrieving relevant documents from a knowledge database and applying an LLM to the retrieved documents. We demonstrate that RAG systems that operate on databases with untrusted content are vulnerable to denial-of-service attacks we call jamming. An adversary can add a single ``blocker'' document to the database that will be retrieved in response to a specific query and result in the RAG system not answering this query - ostensibly because it lacks the relevant information or because the answer is unsafe. We describe and measure the efficacy of several methods for generating blocker documents, including a new method based on black-box optimization. This method (1) does not rely on instruction injection, (2) does not require the adversary to know the embedding or LLM used by the target RAG system, and (3) does not rely on an auxiliary LLM. We evaluate jamming attacks on several LLMs and embeddings and demonstrate that the existing safety metrics for LLMs do not capture their vulnerability to jamming. We then discuss defenses against blocker documents.</p></details> |  |
| **[Visual RAG: Expanding MLLM visual knowledge without fine-tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10834v1)** | 2025-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved notable performance in computer vision tasks that require reasoning across visual and textual modalities, yet their capabilities are limited to their pre-trained data, requiring extensive fine-tuning for updates. Recent researches have explored the use of In-Context Learning (ICL) to overcome these challenges by providing a set of demonstrating examples as context to augment MLLMs performance in several tasks, showing that many-shot ICL leads to substantial improvements compared to few-shot ICL. However, the reliance on numerous demonstrating examples and the limited MLLMs context windows presents significant obstacles. This paper aims to address these challenges by introducing a novel approach, Visual RAG, that synergically combines the MLLMs capability to learn from the context, with a retrieval mechanism. The crux of this approach is to ensure to augment the MLLM knowledge by selecting only the most relevant demonstrating examples for the query, pushing it to learn by analogy. In this way, relying on the new information provided dynamically during inference time, the resulting system is not limited to the knowledge extracted from the training data, but can be updated rapidly and easily without fine-tuning. Furthermore, this greatly reduces the computational costs for improving the model image classification performance, and augments the model knowledge to new visual domains and tasks it was not trained for. Extensive experiments on eight different datasets in the state of the art spanning several domains and image classification tasks show that the proposed Visual RAG, compared to the most recent state of the art (i.e., many-shot ICL), is able to obtain an accuracy that is very close or even higher (approx. +2% improvement on average) while using a much smaller set of demonstrating examples (approx. only 23% on average).</p></details> |  |
| **[4bit-Quantization in Vector-Embedding for RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10534v1)** | 2025-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a promising technique that has shown great potential in addressing some of the limitations of large language models (LLMs). LLMs have two major limitations: they can contain outdated information due to their training data, and they can generate factually inaccurate responses, a phenomenon known as hallucinations. RAG aims to mitigate these issues by leveraging a database of relevant documents, which are stored as embedding vectors in a high-dimensional space. However, one of the challenges of using high-dimensional embeddings is that they require a significant amount of memory to store. This can be a major issue, especially when dealing with large databases of documents. To alleviate this problem, we propose the use of 4-bit quantization to store the embedding vectors. This involves reducing the precision of the vectors from 32-bit floating-point numbers to 4-bit integers, which can significantly reduce the memory requirements. Our approach has several benefits. Firstly, it significantly reduces the memory storage requirements of the high-dimensional vector database, making it more feasible to deploy RAG systems in resource-constrained environments. Secondly, it speeds up the searching process, as the reduced precision of the vectors allows for faster computation. Our code is available at https://github.com/taeheej/4bit-Quantization-in-Vector-Embedding-for-RAG</p></details> |  |
| **[SteLLA: A Structured Grading System Using LLMs with RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09092v1)** | 2025-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong general capabilities in many applications. However, how to make them reliable tools for some specific tasks such as automated short answer grading (ASAG) remains a challenge. We present SteLLA (Structured Grading System Using LLMs with RAG) in which a) Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approach is used to empower LLMs specifically on the ASAG task by extracting structured information from the highly relevant and reliable external knowledge based on the instructor-provided reference answer and rubric, b) an LLM performs a structured and question-answering-based evaluation of student answers to provide analytical grades and feedback. A real-world dataset that contains students' answers in an exam was collected from a college-level Biology course. Experiments show that our proposed system can achieve substantial agreement with the human grader while providing break-down grades and feedback on all the knowledge points examined in the problem. A qualitative and error analysis of the feedback generated by GPT4 shows that GPT4 is good at capturing facts while may be prone to inferring too much implication from the given text in the grading task which provides insights into the usage of LLMs in the ASAG system.</p></details> |  |

We propose the concept of the Sustainable AI Trilemma, highlighting the tensions between AI capability, digital equity, and environmental sustainability. Through a systematic case study of LLM agents and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), we analyze the energy costs embedded in memory module designs and introduce novel metrics to quantify the trade-offs between energy consumption and system performance. Our experimental results reveal significant energy inefficiencies in current memory-augmented frameworks and demonstrate that resource-constrained environments face disproportionate efficiency penalties. Our findings challenge the prevailing LLM-centric paradigm in agent design and provide practical insights for developing more sustainable AI systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[ASTRID -- An Automated and Scalable TRIaD for the Evaluation of RAG-based Clinical Question Answering Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08208v1)** | 2025-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive potential in clinical question answering (QA), with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) emerging as a leading approach for ensuring the factual accuracy of model responses. However, current automated RAG metrics perform poorly in clinical and conversational use cases. Using clinical human evaluations of responses is expensive, unscalable, and not conducive to the continuous iterative development of RAG systems. To address these challenges, we introduce ASTRID - an Automated and Scalable TRIaD for evaluating clinical QA systems leveraging RAG - consisting of three metrics: Context Relevance (CR), Refusal Accuracy (RA), and Conversational Faithfulness (CF). Our novel evaluation metric, CF, is designed to better capture the faithfulness of a model's response to the knowledge base without penalising conversational elements. To validate our triad, we curate a dataset of over 200 real-world patient questions posed to an LLM-based QA agent during surgical follow-up for cataract surgery - the highest volume operation in the world - augmented with clinician-selected questions for emergency, clinical, and non-clinical out-of-domain scenarios. We demonstrate that CF can predict human ratings of faithfulness better than existing definitions for conversational use cases. Furthermore, we show that evaluation using our triad consisting of CF, RA, and CR exhibits alignment with clinician assessment for inappropriate, harmful, or unhelpful responses. Finally, using nine different LLMs, we demonstrate that the three metrics can closely agree with human evaluations, highlighting the potential of these metrics for use in LLM-driven automated evaluation pipelines. We also publish the prompts and datasets for these experiments, providing valuable resources for further research and development.</p></details> | 29 pages |
| **[Research on the Online Update Method for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Model with Incremental Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07063v1)** | 2025-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the contemporary context of rapid advancements in information technology and the exponential growth of data volume, language models are confronted with significant challenges in effectively navigating the dynamic and ever-evolving information landscape to update and adapt to novel knowledge in real time. In this work, an online update method is proposed, which is based on the existing Retrieval Enhanced Generation (RAG) model with multiple innovation mechanisms. Firstly, the dynamic memory is used to capture the emerging data samples, and then gradually integrate them into the core model through a tunable knowledge distillation strategy. At the same time, hierarchical indexing and multi-layer gating mechanism are introduced into the retrieval module to ensure that the retrieved content is more targeted and accurate. Finally, a multi-stage network structure is established for different types of inputs in the generation stage, and cross-attention matching and screening are carried out on the intermediate representations of each stage to ensure the effective integration and iterative update of new and old knowledge. Experimental results show that the proposed method is better than the existing mainstream comparison models in terms of knowledge retention and inference accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[TrustRAG: Enhancing Robustness and Trustworthiness in RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00879v2)** | 2025-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enhance large language models (LLMs) by integrating external knowledge sources, enabling more accurate and contextually relevant responses tailored to user queries. However, these systems remain vulnerable to corpus poisoning attacks that can significantly degrade LLM performance through the injection of malicious content. To address these challenges, we propose TrustRAG, a robust framework that systematically filters compromised and irrelevant contents before they are retrieved for generation. Our approach implements a two-stage defense mechanism: At the first stage, it employs K-means clustering to identify potential attack patterns in retrieved documents using cosine similarity and ROUGE metrics as guidance, effectively isolating suspicious content. Secondly, it performs a self-assessment which detects malicious documents and resolves discrepancies between the model's internal knowledge and external information. TrustRAG functions as a plug-and-play, training-free module that integrates seamlessly with any language model, whether open or closed-source. In addition, TrustRAG maintains high contextual relevance while strengthening defenses against corpus poisoning attacks. Through extensive experimental validation, we demonstrate that TrustRAG delivers substantial improvements in retrieval accuracy, efficiency, and attack resistance compared to existing approaches across multiple model architectures and datasets. We have made TrustRAG available as open-source software at \url{https://github.com/HuichiZhou/TrustRAG}.</p></details> |  |
| **[First Token Probability Guided RAG for Telecom Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06468v1)** | 2025-01-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have garnered significant attention for their impressive general-purpose capabilities. For applications requiring intricate domain knowledge, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has shown a distinct advantage in incorporating domain-specific information into LLMs. However, existing RAG research has not fully addressed the challenges of Multiple Choice Question Answering (MCQA) in telecommunications, particularly in terms of retrieval quality and mitigating hallucinations. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel first token probability guided RAG framework. This framework leverages confidence scores to optimize key hyperparameters, such as chunk number and chunk window size, while dynamically adjusting the context. Our method starts by retrieving the most relevant chunks and generates a single token as the potential answer. The probabilities of all options are then normalized to serve as confidence scores, which guide the dynamic adjustment of the context. By iteratively optimizing the hyperparameters based on these confidence scores, we can continuously improve RAG performance. We conducted experiments to validate the effectiveness of our framework, demonstrating its potential to enhance accuracy in domain-specific MCQA tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLMQuoter: Enhancing RAG Capabilities Through Efficient Quote Extraction From Large Contexts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05554v1)** | 2025-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce LLMQuoter, a lightweight, distillation-based model designed to enhance Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) by extracting the most relevant textual evidence for downstream reasoning tasks. Built on the LLaMA-3B architecture and fine-tuned with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on a 15,000-sample subset of HotpotQA, LLMQuoter adopts a "quote-first-then-answer" strategy, efficiently identifying key quotes before passing curated snippets to reasoning models. This workflow reduces cognitive overhead and outperforms full-context approaches like Retrieval-Augmented Fine-Tuning (RAFT), achieving over 20-point accuracy gains across both small and large language models. By leveraging knowledge distillation from a high-performing teacher model, LLMQuoter achieves competitive results in a resource-efficient fine-tuning setup. It democratizes advanced RAG capabilities, delivering significant performance improvements without requiring extensive model retraining. Our results highlight the potential of distilled quote-based reasoning to streamline complex workflows, offering a scalable and practical solution for researchers and practitioners alike.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-task retriever fine-tuning for domain-specific and efficient RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04652v1)** | 2025-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become ubiquitous when deploying Large Language Models (LLMs), as it can address typical limitations such as generating hallucinated or outdated information. However, when building real-world RAG applications, practical issues arise. First, the retrieved information is generally domain-specific. Since it is computationally expensive to fine-tune LLMs, it is more feasible to fine-tune the retriever to improve the quality of the data included in the LLM input. Second, as more applications are deployed in the same real-world system, one cannot afford to deploy separate retrievers. Moreover, these RAG applications normally retrieve different kinds of data. Our solution is to instruction fine-tune a small retriever encoder on a variety of domain-specific tasks to allow us to deploy one encoder that can serve many use cases, thereby achieving low-cost, scalability, and speed. We show how this encoder generalizes to out-of-domain settings as well as to an unseen retrieval task on real-world enterprise use cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 2 figures.

Leveraging the inherent advantages of federated learning, such as preserving data privacy and enabling distributed computation, this research explores the integration of RAG systems with models trained under varying client configurations to optimize performance. Experimental results demonstrate that the federated learning-based models integrated with RAG systems consistently outperform their non-integrated counterparts across all evaluation metrics. This study highlights the potential of combining federated learning and RAG systems for developing domain-specific LLMs in the medical field, providing a scalable and privacy-preserving solution for enhancing text generation capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tree-based RAG-Agent Recommendation System: A Case Study in Medical Test Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02727v1)** | 2025-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present HiRMed (Hierarchical RAG-enhanced Medical Test Recommendation), a novel tree-structured recommendation system that leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for intelligent medical test recommendations. Unlike traditional vector similarity-based approaches, our system performs medical reasoning at each tree node through a specialized RAG process. Starting from the root node with initial symptoms, the system conducts step-wise medical analysis to identify potential underlying conditions and their corresponding diagnostic requirements. At each level, instead of simple matching, our RAG-enhanced nodes analyze retrieved medical knowledge to understand symptom-disease relationships and determine the most appropriate diagnostic path. The system dynamically adjusts its recommendation strategy based on medical reasoning results, considering factors such as urgency levels and diagnostic uncertainty. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance in terms of coverage rate, accuracy, and miss rate compared to conventional retrieval-based methods. This work represents a significant advance in medical test recommendation by introducing medical reasoning capabilities into the traditional tree-based retrieval structure.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Efficiency vs. Accuracy Trade-off: Optimizing RAG-Enhanced LLM Recommender Systems Using Multi-Head Early Exit](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02173v1)** | 2025-01-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in recommender systems for predicting Click-Through Rates (CTR) necessitates a delicate balance between computational efficiency and predictive accuracy. This paper presents an optimization framework that combines Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with an innovative multi-head early exit architecture to concurrently enhance both aspects. By integrating Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) as efficient retrieval mechanisms, we are able to significantly reduce data retrieval times while maintaining high model performance. The early exit strategy employed allows for dynamic termination of model inference, utilizing real-time predictive confidence assessments across multiple heads. This not only quickens the responsiveness of LLMs but also upholds or improves their accuracy, making it ideal for real-time application scenarios. Our experiments demonstrate how this architecture effectively decreases computation time without sacrificing the accuracy needed for reliable recommendation delivery, establishing a new standard for efficient, real-time LLM deployment in commercial systems.</p></details> |  |

Leveraging adaptive RAG for interpretable mental health screening through psychometric practice](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00982v1)** | 2025-01-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In psychological practice, standardized questionnaires serve as essential tools for assessing mental constructs (e.g., attitudes, traits, and emotions) through structured questions (aka items). With the increasing prevalence of social media platforms where users share personal experiences and emotions, researchers are exploring computational methods to leverage this data for rapid mental health screening. In this study, we propose a novel adaptive Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach that completes psychological questionnaires by analyzing social media posts. Our method retrieves the most relevant user posts for each question in a psychological survey and uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to predict questionnaire scores in a zero-shot setting. Our findings are twofold. First we demonstrate that this approach can effectively predict users' responses to psychological questionnaires, such as the Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II), achieving performance comparable to or surpassing state-of-the-art models on Reddit-based benchmark datasets without relying on training data. Second, we show how this methodology can be generalized as a scalable screening tool, as the final assessment is systematically derived by completing standardized questionnaires and tracking how individual item responses contribute to the diagnosis, aligning with established psychometric practices.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose EdgeRAG which addresses the memory constraint by pruning embeddings within clusters and generating embeddings on-demand during retrieval. To avoid the latency of generating embeddings for large tail clusters, EdgeRAG pre-computes and stores embeddings for these clusters, while adaptively caching remaining embeddings to minimize redundant computations and further optimize latency. The result from BEIR suite shows that EdgeRAG offers significant latency reduction over the baseline IVF index, but with similar generation quality while allowing all of our evaluated datasets to fit into the memory.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhanced Multimodal RAG-LLM for Accurate Visual Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20927v1)** | 2024-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs), such as GPT-4o, Gemini, LLaVA, and Flamingo, have made significant progress in integrating visual and textual modalities, excelling in tasks like visual question answering (VQA), image captioning, and content retrieval. They can generate coherent and contextually relevant descriptions of images. However, they still face challenges in accurately identifying and counting objects and determining their spatial locations, particularly in complex scenes with overlapping or small objects. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework based on multimodal retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), which introduces structured scene graphs to enhance object recognition, relationship identification, and spatial understanding within images. Our framework improves the MLLM's capacity to handle tasks requiring precise visual descriptions, especially in scenarios with challenging perspectives, such as aerial views or scenes with dense object arrangements. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on the VG-150 dataset that focuses on first-person visual understanding and the AUG dataset that involves aerial imagery. The results show that our approach consistently outperforms existing MLLMs in VQA tasks, which stands out in recognizing, localizing, and quantifying objects in different spatial contexts and provides more accurate visual descriptions.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures, under review</p></details> |
| **[Pirates of the RAG: Adaptively Attacking LLMs to Leak Knowledge Bases](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18295v2)** | 2024-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing ubiquity of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems in several real-world services triggers severe concerns about their security. A RAG system improves the generative capabilities of a Large Language Models (LLM) by a retrieval mechanism which operates on a private knowledge base, whose unintended exposure could lead to severe consequences, including breaches of private and sensitive information. This paper presents a black-box attack to force a RAG system to leak its private knowledge base which, differently from existing approaches, is adaptive and automatic. A relevance-based mechanism and an attacker-side open-source LLM favor the generation of effective queries to leak most of the (hidden) knowledge base. Extensive experimentation proves the quality of the proposed algorithm in different RAG pipelines and domains, comparing to very recent related approaches, which turn out to be either not fully black-box, not adaptive, or not based on open-source models. The findings from our study remark the urgent need for more robust privacy safeguards in the design and deployment of RAG systems.</p></details> |  |

This paper revisits recent studies on this topic, highlighting their key insights and discrepancies. We then provide a more comprehensive evaluation by filtering out questions answerable without external context, identifying the most effective retrieval methods, and expanding the datasets. We show that LC generally outperforms RAG in question-answering benchmarks, especially for Wikipedia-based questions. Summarization-based retrieval performs comparably to LC, while chunk-based retrieval lags behind. However, RAG has advantages in dialogue-based and general question queries. These insights underscore the trade-offs between RAG and LC strategies, offering guidance for future optimization of LLMs with external knowledge sources. We also provide an in-depth discussion on this topic, highlighting the overlooked importance of context relevance in existing studies.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages excluding references and appendix</p></details> |

Unlike traditional SSTC approaches that rely on a predefined small set of labeled data to generate pseudo-labels for the unlabeled data, this framework innovatively employs clustering to select representative "landmarks" for labeling. These landmarks subsequently act as intermediaries in an ensemble of augmentation techniques, including Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Large Language Model (LLMs)-based rewriting, and synonym substitution, to generate synthetic labeled data without making pseudo-labels for the unlabeled data. Empirical results show that even in complex text document classification scenarios involving over 100 categories, our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracies of 95.41% on the Reuters dataset and 82.43% on the Web of Science dataset. Our approach significantly reduces the reliance on human labeling efforts and the associated expenses, while simultaneously ensuring high data quality and minimizing privacy risks. The finetuning results further show the efficiency of fine-tuning LLMs for text classification tasks, highlighting a robust solution for leveraging limited labeled data.</p></details> |  |

However, SPARQL has certain shortcomings: (i) it is brittle for complex intents and conversational questions, and (ii) it is not suitable for more abstract needs. Instead, we propose a novel two-pronged system where we fuse: (i) SQL-query results over a database automatically derived from the KG, and (ii) text-search results over verbalizations of KG facts. Our pipeline supports iterative retrieval: when the results of any branch are found to be unsatisfactory, the system can automatically opt for further rounds. We put everything together in a retrieval augmented generation (RAG) setup, where an LLM generates a coherent response from accumulated search results. We demonstrate the superiority of our proposed system over several baselines on a knowledge graph of BMW automobiles.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at BTW 2025, 10 pages</p></details> |

It is preferable that successful RAG systems provide accurate answers that are supported by being grounded in a passage without any hallucinations. While considerable work is required for building a full RAG pipeline, being able to benchmark performance is also necessary. We present ClapNQ, a benchmark Long-form Question Answering dataset for the full RAG pipeline. ClapNQ includes long answers with grounded gold passages from Natural Questions (NQ) and a corpus to perform either retrieval, generation, or the full RAG pipeline. The ClapNQ answers are concise, 3x smaller than the full passage, and cohesive, meaning that the answer is composed fluently, often by integrating multiple pieces of the passage that are not contiguous. RAG models must adapt to these properties to be successful at ClapNQ. We present baseline experiments and analysis for ClapNQ that highlight areas where there is still significant room for improvement in grounded RAG.

| **[Evidence Contextualization and Counterfactual Attribution for Conversational QA over Heterogeneous Data with RAG Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10571v3)** | 2024-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) works as a backbone for interacting with an enterprise's own data via Conversational Question Answering (ConvQA). In a RAG system, a retriever fetches passages from a collection in response to a question, which are then included in the prompt of a large language model (LLM) for generating a natural language (NL) answer. However, several RAG systems today suffer from two shortcomings: (i) retrieved passages usually contain their raw text and lack appropriate document context, negatively impacting both retrieval and answering quality; and (ii) attribution strategies that explain answer generation typically rely only on similarity between the answer and the retrieved passages, thereby only generating plausible but not causal explanations. In this work, we demonstrate RAGONITE, a RAG system that remedies the above concerns by: (i) contextualizing evidence with source metadata and surrounding text; and (ii) computing counterfactual attribution, a causal explanation approach where the contribution of an evidence to an answer is determined by the similarity of the original response to the answer obtained by removing that evidence. To evaluate our proposals, we release a new benchmark ConfQuestions: it has 300 hand-created conversational questions, each in English and German, coupled with ground truth URLs, completed questions, and answers from 215 public Confluence pages. These documents are typical of enterprise wiki spaces with heterogeneous elements. Experiments with RAGONITE on ConfQuestions show the viability of our ideas: contextualization improves RAG performance, and counterfactual explanations outperform standard attribution.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at WSDM 2025, 8 pages</p></details> |

However, these systems are vulnerable to adversarial poisoning attacks, where malicious passages injected into retrieval databases can mislead the model into generating factually incorrect outputs. In this paper, we investigate both the retrieval and the generation components of RAG systems to understand how to enhance their robustness against such attacks. From the retrieval perspective, we analyze why and how the adversarial contexts are retrieved and assess how the quality of the retrieved passages impacts downstream generation. From a generation perspective, we evaluate whether LLMs' advanced critical thinking and internal knowledge capabilities can be leveraged to mitigate the impact of adversarial contexts, i.e., using skeptical prompting as a self-defense mechanism. Our experiments and findings provide actionable insights into designing safer and more resilient retrieval-augmented frameworks, paving the way for their reliable deployment in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Don't Do RAG: When Cache-Augmented Generation is All You Need for Knowledge Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15605v1)** | 2024-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has gained traction as a powerful approach for enhancing language models by integrating external knowledge sources. However, RAG introduces challenges such as retrieval latency, potential errors in document selection, and increased system complexity. With the advent of large language models (LLMs) featuring significantly extended context windows, this paper proposes an alternative paradigm, cache-augmented generation (CAG) that bypasses real-time retrieval. Our method involves preloading all relevant resources, especially when the documents or knowledge for retrieval are of a limited and manageable size, into the LLM's extended context and caching its runtime parameters. During inference, the model utilizes these preloaded parameters to answer queries without additional retrieval steps. Comparative analyses reveal that CAG eliminates retrieval latency and minimizes retrieval errors while maintaining context relevance. Performance evaluations across multiple benchmarks highlight scenarios where long-context LLMs either outperform or complement traditional RAG pipelines. These findings suggest that, for certain applications, particularly those with a constrained knowledge base, CAG provide a streamlined and efficient alternative to RAG, achieving comparable or superior results with reduced complexity.</p></details> |  |

However, many natural questions do not have good answers: about 25\% contain false assumptions~\cite{Yu2023:CREPE}, and over 50\% are ambiguous~\cite{DBLP:conf/emnlp/MinMHZ20}. RAG agents need high-quality data to improve their responses to confusing questions. This paper presents a novel guided hallucination-based method to efficiently generate a diverse set of borderline out-of-scope confusing questions for a given document corpus. We conduct an empirical comparative evaluation of several large language models as RAG agents to measure the accuracy of confusion detection and appropriate response generation. We contribute a benchmark dataset to the public domain.</p></details> | under review |

Evaluating RAG-based Fact-checking Pipelines in Realistic Settings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15189v1)** | 2024-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Natural Language Processing and Generation systems have recently shown the potential to complement and streamline the costly and time-consuming job of professional fact-checkers. In this work, we lift several constraints of current state-of-the-art pipelines for automated fact-checking based on the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) paradigm. Our goal is to benchmark, under more realistic scenarios, RAG-based methods for the generation of verdicts - i.e., short texts discussing the veracity of a claim - evaluating them on stylistically complex claims and heterogeneous, yet reliable, knowledge bases. Our findings show a complex landscape, where, for example, LLM-based retrievers outperform other retrieval techniques, though they still struggle with heterogeneous knowledge bases; larger models excel in verdict faithfulness, while smaller models provide better context adherence, with human evaluations favouring zero-shot and one-shot approaches for informativeness, and fine-tuned models for emotional alignment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and data at https://github.com/drusso98/face-the-facts</p></details> |

When a general-purpose LLM serves as the RAG generator, it often suffers from inadequate response informativeness, response robustness, and citation quality. Past approaches to tackle these limitations, either by incorporating additional steps beyond generating responses or optimizing the generator through supervised fine-tuning (SFT), still failed to align with the RAG requirement thoroughly. Consequently, optimizing the RAG generator from multiple preference perspectives while maintaining its end-to-end LLM form remains a challenge. To bridge this gap, we propose Multiple Perspective Preference Alignment for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (PA-RAG), a method for optimizing the generator of RAG systems to align with RAG requirements comprehensively. Specifically, we construct high-quality instruction fine-tuning data and multi-perspective preference data by sampling varied quality responses from the generator across different prompt documents quality scenarios. Subsequently, we optimize the generator using SFT and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Extensive experiments conducted on four question-answer datasets across three LLMs demonstrate that PA-RAG can significantly enhance the performance of RAG generators. Our code and datasets are available at https://github.com/wujwyi/PA-RAG.</p></details> |  |

To address these challenges, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) retrieves audio-text pairs from a knowledge base (KB) and augments them with query audio to generate accurate textual responses. In RAG, the relevance of the retrieved information plays a crucial role in effectively processing the input. In this paper, we analyze how different retrieval methods and knowledge bases impact the relevance of audio-text pairs and the performance of audio captioning with RAG. We propose generative pair-to-pair retrieval, which uses the generated caption as a text query to accurately find relevant audio-text pairs to the query audio, thereby improving the relevance and accuracy of retrieved information. Additionally, we refine the large-scale knowledge base to retain only audio-text pairs that align with the contextualized intents. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on benchmarks including AudioCaps, Clotho, and Auto-ACD, with detailed ablation studies validating the effectiveness of our retrieval and KB construction methods.</p></details> |  |

They are used to convey subtle, implicit meaning, or to emphasize statements. We notice them in hate speech, fake news, and propaganda. By improving the systems for computational detection of rhetorical figures, we can also improve tasks such as hate speech and fake news detection, sentiment analysis, opinion mining, or argument mining. Unfortunately, there is a lack of annotated data, as well as qualified annotators that would help us build large corpora to train machine learning models for the detection of rhetorical figures. The situation is particularly difficult in languages other than English, and for rhetorical figures other than metaphor, sarcasm, and irony. To overcome this issue, we develop a web application called "Find your Figure" that facilitates the identification and annotation of German rhetorical figures. The application is based on the German Rhetorical ontology GRhOOT which we have specially adapted for this purpose. In addition, we improve the user experience with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). In this paper, we present the restructuring of the ontology, the development of the web application, and the built-in RAG pipeline. We also identify the optimal RAG settings for our application. Our approach is one of the first to practically use rhetorical ontologies in combination with RAG and shows promising results.</p></details> | <details><summary>The 3...</summary><p>The 31st International Conference on Computational Linguistics (COLING 2025)</p></details> |

In this paper, we introduce an omnidirectional and automatic RAG benchmark, OmniEval, in the financial domain. Our benchmark is characterized by its multi-dimensional evaluation framework, including (1) a matrix-based RAG scenario evaluation system that categorizes queries into five task classes and 16 financial topics, leading to a structured assessment of diverse query scenarios; (2) a multi-dimensional evaluation data generation approach, which combines GPT-4-based automatic generation and human annotation, achieving an 87.47\% acceptance ratio in human evaluations on generated instances; (3) a multi-stage evaluation system that evaluates both retrieval and generation performance, result in a comprehensive evaluation on the RAG pipeline; and (4) robust evaluation metrics derived from rule-based and LLM-based ones, enhancing the reliability of assessments through manual annotations and supervised fine-tuning of an LLM evaluator.

However, the misinformation in external documents may mislead LLMs' generation. To address this issue, we explore the task of "credibility-aware RAG", in which LLMs automatically adjust the influence of retrieved documents based on their credibility scores to counteract misinformation. To this end, we introduce a plug-and-play method named $\textbf{Cr}$edibility-aware $\textbf{A}$ttention $\textbf{M}$odification (CrAM). CrAM identifies influential attention heads in LLMs and adjusts their attention weights based on the credibility of the documents, thereby reducing the impact of low-credibility documents. Experiments on Natual Questions and TriviaQA using Llama2-13B, Llama3-8B, and Qwen1.5-7B show that CrAM improves the RAG performance of LLMs against misinformation pollution by over 20%, even surpassing supervised fine-tuning methods.</p></details> | AAAI25 camera-ready |
| **[RemoteRAG: A Privacy-Preserving LLM Cloud RAG Service](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12775v1)** | 2024-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) improves the service quality of large language models by retrieving relevant documents from credible literature and integrating them into the context of the user query. Recently, the rise of the cloud RAG service has made it possible for users to query relevant documents conveniently. However, directly sending queries to the cloud brings potential privacy leakage. In this paper, we are the first to formally define the privacy-preserving cloud RAG service to protect the user query and propose RemoteRAG as a solution regarding privacy, efficiency, and accuracy. For privacy, we introduce $(n,\epsilon)$-DistanceDP to characterize privacy leakage of the user query and the leakage inferred from relevant documents. For efficiency, we limit the search range from the total documents to a small number of selected documents related to a perturbed embedding generated from $(n,\epsilon)$-DistanceDP, so that computation and communication costs required for privacy protection significantly decrease. For accuracy, we ensure that the small range includes target documents related to the user query with detailed theoretical analysis. Experimental results also demonstrate that RemoteRAG can resist existing embedding inversion attack methods while achieving no loss in retrieval under various settings. Moreover, RemoteRAG is efficient, incurring only $0.67$ seconds and $46.66$KB of data transmission ($2.72$ hours and $1.43$ GB with the non-optimized privacy-preserving scheme) when retrieving from a total of $10^6$ documents.</p></details> |  |

The framework implements and compares three retrieval approaches: naive vector search, reranking, and hybrid vector-keyword search, combined with ReAct agents using different prompting strategies. We introduce a comprehensive evaluation framework with novel metrics and provide empirical results comparing different language models (Llama 3.1 and Qwen 2.5) across various retrieval configurations. Our experiments demonstrate significant performance improvements through hybrid search methods and structured self-evaluation prompting, achieving up to 72.7% pass rate on our multi-metric evaluation framework. The results also highlight the importance of prompt engineering in RAG systems, with our custom-prompted agents showing consistent improvements in retrieval accuracy and response quality.</p></details> | Work In Progress |

Employing a user-centered design approach, we developed the chatbot using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system, which enables behavior personalization without retraining the underlying language model (GPT-4). The system leverages document retrieval and specialized prompts to tailor interactions, drawing from Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and narrative therapy techniques. A key challenge in the development process was the difficulty of translating declarative knowledge into effective interaction behaviors. In the initial phase, the chatbot was provided with declarative knowledge about CBT via reference textbooks and high-level conversational goals. However, this approach resulted in imprecise and inefficient behavior, as the GPT model struggled to convert static information into dynamic and contextually appropriate interactions. This highlighted the limitations of relying solely on declarative knowledge to guide chatbot behavior, particularly in nuanced, therapeutic conversations. Over four iterations, we addressed this issue by gradually transitioning towards procedural knowledge, refining the chatbot's interaction strategies, and improving its overall effectiveness. In the final evaluation, 5 participants engaged with the chatbot over five consecutive days, receiving individualized CBT interventions. The Self-Report Habit Index (SRHI) was used to measure habit strength before and after the intervention, revealing a reduction in habit strength post-intervention. These results underscore the importance of procedural knowledge in driving effective, personalized behavior change support in RAG-based systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for Italian Workshop on Artificial Intelligence for Human Machine Interaction (AIxHMI 2024), November 26, 2024, Bolzano, Italy</p></details> |
| **[RAGServe: Fast Quality-Aware RAG Systems with Configuration Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10543v1)** | 2024-12-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) allows LLMs (large language models) to generate better responses with external knowledge, but using more external knowledge often improves generation quality at the expense of response delay. Prior work either reduces the response delay (through better scheduling of RAG queries) or strives to maximize quality (which involves tuning the RAG workflow), but they fall short in optimizing the tradeoff between the delay and quality of RAG responses. This paper presents RAGServe, the first RAG system that jointly schedules queries and adapts the key RAG configurations of each query, such as the number of retrieved text chunks and synthesis methods, in order to balance quality optimization and response delay reduction. Using 4 popular RAG-QA datasets, we show that compared with the state-of-the-art RAG optimization schemes, RAGServe reduces the generation latency by $1.64-2.54\times$ without sacrificing generation quality.</p></details> | 17 pages, 18 figures |

Our system dynamically retrieves detailed character information and relational data from the knowledge graph, enabling the generation of visually accurate and contextually rich images. This capability significantly improves upon the limitations of existing T2I models, which often struggle with the accurate depiction of complex or culturally specific subjects due to dataset constraints. Furthermore, we propose a novel self-correcting mechanism for text-to-image models to ensure consistency and fidelity in visual outputs, leveraging the rich context from the graph to guide corrections. Our qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that Context Canvas significantly enhances the capabilities of popular models such as Flux, Stable Diffusion, and DALL-E, and improves the functionality of ControlNet for fine-grained image editing tasks. To our knowledge, Context Canvas represents the first application of graph-based RAG in enhancing T2I models, representing a significant advancement for producing high-fidelity, context-aware multi-faceted images.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://context-canvas.github.io/</p></details> |

In these domains, maintaining consistency, adhering to regulatory frameworks, minimizing errors, and meeting critical expectations are essential for the reliable functioning of systems. The widespread adoption of large language models (LLMs) highlights their immense potential, yet there remains considerable scope for improvement in retrieving relevant information and enhancing reasoning capabilities. This study demonstrates that integrating a robust Graph-RAG framework with advanced prompt engineering techniques, such as Chain of Thought and Tree of Thought, can significantly enhance performance. Compared to baseline RAG methods and simple prompting strategies, this approach delivers more accurate and context-aware results. While this method demonstrates significant improvements in performance, it comes with challenges. It is both costly and more complex to implement across diverse contexts, requiring careful adaptation to specific scenarios. Additionally, its effectiveness heavily relies on having complete and accurate input data, which may not always be readily available, posing further limitations to its scalability and practicality.</p></details> |  |

AI-driven question-answering (QA) systems can actively manage uncertainty in cybersecurity problem-solving, offering interactive, inquiry-based learning experiences. Large language models (LLMs) have gained prominence in AI-driven QA systems, offering advanced language understanding and user engagement. However, they face challenges like hallucinations and limited domain-specific knowledge, which reduce their reliability in educational settings. To address these challenges, we propose CyberRAG, an ontology-aware retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approach for developing a reliable and safe QA system in cybersecurity education. CyberRAG employs a two-step approach: first, it augments the domain-specific knowledge by retrieving validated cybersecurity documents from a knowledge base to enhance the relevance and accuracy of the response. Second, it mitigates hallucinations and misuse by integrating a knowledge graph ontology to validate the final answer. Experiments on publicly available cybersecurity datasets show that CyberRAG delivers accurate, reliable responses aligned with domain knowledge, demonstrating the potential of AI tools to enhance education.</p></details> |  |

Producing such semantic co-speech gestures has been a major challenge for the existing neural systems that can generate rhythmic beat gestures, but struggle to produce semantically meaningful gestures. Therefore, we present RAG-Gesture, a diffusion-based gesture generation approach that leverages Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to produce natural-looking and semantically rich gestures. Our neuro-explicit gesture generation approach is designed to produce semantic gestures grounded in interpretable linguistic knowledge. We achieve this by using explicit domain knowledge to retrieve exemplar motions from a database of co-speech gestures. Once retrieved, we then inject these semantic exemplar gestures into our diffusion-based gesture generation pipeline using DDIM inversion and retrieval guidance at the inference time without any need of training. Further, we propose a control paradigm for guidance, that allows the users to modulate the amount of influence each retrieval insertion has over the generated sequence. Our comparative evaluations demonstrate the validity of our approach against recent gesture generation approaches.

This paper introduces Hypothetical Command Embeddings (HyCE), a novel method that extends Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by integrating real-time, user-specific HPC data, enhancing accessibility to these systems. HyCE enriches large language models (LLM) with real-time, user-specific HPC information, addressing the limitations of fine-tuned models on such data. We evaluate HyCE using an automated RAG evaluation framework, where the LLM itself creates synthetic questions from the HPC data and serves as a judge, assessing the efficacy of the extended RAG with the evaluation metrics relevant for HPC tasks. Additionally, we tackle essential security concerns, including data privacy and command execution risks, associated with deploying LLMs in HPC environments. This solution provides a scalable and adaptable approach for HPC clusters to leverage LLMs as HPC expert, bridging the gap between users and the complex systems of HPC.</p></details> | preprint |
| **[Hybrid RAG-empowered Multi-modal LLM for Secure Data Management in Internet of Medical Things: A Diffusion-based Contract Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00978v2)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Secure data management and effective data sharing have become paramount in the rapidly evolving healthcare landscape, especially with the growing integration of the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). The rise of generative artificial intelligence has further elevated Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) as essential tools for managing and optimizing healthcare data in IoMT. MLLMs can support multi-modal inputs and generate diverse types of content by leveraging large-scale training on vast amounts of multi-modal data. However, critical challenges persist in developing medical MLLMs, including security and freshness issues of healthcare data, affecting the output quality of MLLMs. To this end, in this paper, we propose a hybrid Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-empowered medical MLLM framework for healthcare data management. This framework leverages a hierarchical cross-chain architecture to facilitate secure data training. Moreover, it enhances the output quality of MLLMs through hybrid RAG, which employs multi-modal metrics to filter various unimodal RAG results and incorporates these retrieval results as additional inputs to MLLMs. Additionally, we employ age of information to indirectly evaluate the data freshness impact of MLLMs and utilize contract theory to incentivize healthcare data holders to share their fresh data, mitigating information asymmetry during data sharing. Finally, we utilize a generative diffusion model-based deep reinforcement learning algorithm to identify the optimal contract for efficient data sharing. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes, which achieve secure and efficient healthcare data management.</p></details> | 13 pages, 7 figures |

Traditional RAG enhancements have explored vertical scaling -- assigning subtasks to specialized modules -- and horizontal scaling -- replicating tasks across multiple agents -- to improve performance. However, real-world applications impose diverse Service Level Agreements (SLAs) and Quality of Service (QoS) requirements, involving trade-offs among objectives such as reducing cost, ensuring answer quality, and adhering to specific operational constraints. In this work, we present a systems-oriented approach to multi-agent RAG tailored for real-world Question Answering (QA) applications. By integrating task-specific non-functional requirements -- such as answer quality, cost, and latency -- into the system, we enable dynamic reconfiguration to meet diverse SLAs. Our method maps these Service Level Objectives (SLOs) to system-level parameters, allowing the generation of optimal results within specified resource constraints. We conduct a case study in the QA domain, demonstrating how dynamic re-orchestration of a multi-agent RAG system can effectively manage the trade-off between answer quality and cost. By adjusting the system based on query intent and operational conditions, we systematically balance performance and resource utilization. This approach allows the system to meet SLOs for various query types, showcasing its practicality for real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

Data augmentation can potentially alleviate the data shortage, but augmenting vulnerable code is challenging and requires a generative solution that maintains vulnerability. Previous works have only focused on generating samples that contain single statements or specific types of vulnerabilities. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been used to solve various code generation and comprehension tasks with inspiring results, especially when fused with retrieval augmented generation (RAG). Therefore, we propose VulScribeR, a novel LLM-based solution that leverages carefully curated prompt templates to augment vulnerable datasets. More specifically, we explore three strategies to augment both single and multi-statement vulnerabilities, with LLMs, namely Mutation, Injection, and Extension. Our extensive evaluation across three vulnerability datasets and DLVD models, using two LLMs, show that our approach beats two SOTA methods Vulgen and VGX, and Random Oversampling (ROS) by 27.48%, 27.93%, and 15.41% in f1-score with 5K generated vulnerable samples on average, and 53.84%, 54.10%, 69.90%, and 40.93% with 15K generated vulnerable samples. Our approach demonstrates its feasibility for large-scale data augmentation by generating 1K samples at as cheap as US$ 1.88.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 6 figures, 5 tables, 3 prompt templates, 1 algorithm</p></details> |

However, despite retrieval being a core component of RAG, much of the research in this area overlooks the extensive body of work on fair ranking, neglecting the importance of considering all stakeholders involved. This paper presents the first systematic evaluation of RAG systems integrated with fair rankings. We focus specifically on measuring the fair exposure of each relevant item across the rankings utilized by RAG systems (i.e., item-side fairness), aiming to promote equitable growth for relevant item providers. To gain a deep understanding of the relationship between item-fairness, ranking quality, and generation quality in the context of RAG, we analyze nine different RAG systems that incorporate fair rankings across seven distinct datasets. Our findings indicate that RAG systems with fair rankings can maintain a high level of generation quality and, in many cases, even outperform traditional RAG systems, despite the general trend of a tradeoff between ensuring fairness and maintaining system-effectiveness. We believe our insights lay the groundwork for responsible and equitable RAG systems and open new avenues for future research.

As an essential part of RAG, external knowledge bases are commonly built by extracting structured data from unstructured PDF documents using Optical Character Recognition (OCR). However, given the imperfect prediction of OCR and the inherent non-uniform representation of structured data, knowledge bases inevitably contain various OCR noises. In this paper, we introduce OHRBench, the first benchmark for understanding the cascading impact of OCR on RAG systems. OHRBench includes 350 carefully selected unstructured PDF documents from six real-world RAG application domains, along with Q&As derived from multimodal elements in documents, challenging existing OCR solutions used for RAG To better understand OCR's impact on RAG systems, we identify two primary types of OCR noise: Semantic Noise and Formatting Noise and apply perturbation to generate a set of structured data with varying degrees of each OCR noise. Using OHRBench, we first conduct a comprehensive evaluation of current OCR solutions and reveal that none is competent for constructing high-quality knowledge bases for RAG systems. We then systematically evaluate the impact of these two noise types and demonstrate the vulnerability of RAG systems. Furthermore, we discuss the potential of employing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) without OCR in RAG systems. Code: https://github.com/opendatalab/OHR-Bench</p></details> |  |

The challenge of applying computer vision to niche, real-world domains such as ocean conservation lies in the dynamic and diverse environments where traditional top-down learning struggle with long-tailed distributions, generalization, and domain transfer. Scalable species identification for ocean monitoring is particularly difficult due to the need to adapt models to new environments and identify rare or unseen species. To overcome these limitations, we propose leveraging bottom-up, open-domain learning frameworks as a resilient, scalable solution for image and video analysis in marine applications. Our preliminary demonstration uses pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) combined with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) as grounding, leaving the door open for numerous architectural, training and engineering optimizations.

With the popularity of Foundation Models (FMs) that generate text, images, and video, AI-based systems are increasing their complexity. Compared to traditional AI-based software, systems employing FMs, or GenAI-based systems, are more difficult to design due to their scale and versatility. This makes it necessary to document best practices, known as design patterns in software engineering, that can be used across GenAI applications. Our first contribution is to formalize two techniques, Task Decomposition and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), as design patterns for GenAI-based systems. We discuss their trade-offs in terms of software quality attributes and comment on alternative approaches. We recommend to AI practitioners to consider these techniques not only from a scientific perspective but also from the standpoint of desired engineering properties such as flexibility, maintainability, safety, and security. As a second contribution, we describe our industry experience applying Task Decomposition and RAG to build a complex real-world GenAI application for enterprise users: Workflow Generation. The task of generating workflows entails generating a specific plan using data from the system environment, taking as input a user requirement.

While many tools exist empowering developers to build their own systems, measuring their performance locally, with datasets reflective of the system's use cases, is a technological challenge. Solutions to this problem range from non-specific and cheap (most public datasets) to specific and costly (generating data from local documents). In this paper, we show that using public question and answer (Q&A) datasets to assess retrieval performance can lead to non-optimal systems design, and that common tools for RAG dataset generation can lead to unbalanced data. We propose solutions to these issues based on the characterization of RAG datasets through labels and through label-targeted data generation. Finally, we show that fine-tuned small LLMs can efficiently generate Q&A datasets.

This pilot study focuses on specializing ChatGPT behavior through a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using the OpenAI custom GPTs feature. The purpose of our chatbot, called Unimib Assistant, is to provide information and solutions to the specific needs of University of Milano-Bicocca (Unimib) students through a question-answering approach. We provided the system with a prompt highlighting its specific purpose and behavior, as well as university-related documents and links obtained from an initial need-finding phase, interviewing six students. After a preliminary customization phase, a qualitative usability test was conducted with six other students to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the chatbot, with the goal of improving it in a subsequent redesign phase. While the chatbot was appreciated for its user-friendly experience, perceived general reliability, well-structured responses, and conversational tone, several significant technical and functional limitations emerged. In particular, the satisfaction and overall experience of the users was impaired by the system's inability to always provide fully accurate information. Moreover, it would often neglect to report relevant information even if present in the materials uploaded and prompt given. Furthermore, it sometimes generated unclickable links, undermining its trustworthiness, since providing the source of information was an important aspect for our users.

In the automotive industry, there is a growing demand for knowledge transfer of failure analysis from experienced engineers to young engineers. However, failure events are phenomena that occur in a chain reaction, making them difficult for beginners to analyze them. While knowledge graphs, which can describe semantic relationships and structure information is effective in representing failure events, due to their capability of representing the relationships between components, there is much information in KGs, so it is challenging for young engineers to extract and understand sub-graphs from the KG. On the other hand, there is increasing interest in the use of Graph RAG, a type of RAG that combines LLMs and KGs for knowledge management. However, when using the current Graph RAG framework with an existing knowledge graph for automobile failures, several issues arise because it is difficult to generate executable queries for a knowledge graph database which is not constructed by LLMs. To address this, we focused on optimizing the Graph RAG pipeline for existing knowledge graphs. Using an original Q&A dataset, the ROUGE F1 score of the sentences generated by the proposed method showed an average improvement of 157.6% compared to the current method. This highlights the effectiveness of the proposed method for automobile failure analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 6 figures, to be published in 2024 IEEE International Conference on Bid Data (BigData)</p></details> |

While LLM-driven RAG systems show superior performance, they face unique challenges in stability and reliability. Their complexity hinders developers' efforts to design, maintain, and optimize effective RAG systems. Therefore, it is crucial to understand how RAG's performance is impacted by its design. In this work, we conduct an early exploratory study toward a better understanding of the mechanism of RAG systems, covering three code datasets, three QA datasets, and two LLMs. We focus on four design factors: retrieval document type, retrieval recall, document selection, and prompt techniques. Our study uncovers how each factor impacts system correctness and confidence, providing valuable insights for developing an accurate and reliable RAG system. Based on these findings, we present nine actionable guidelines for detecting defects and optimizing the performance of RAG systems. We hope our early exploration can inspire further advancements in engineering, improving and maintaining LLM-driven intelligent software systems for greater efficiency and reliability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Knowledge Database or Poison Base? Detecting RAG Poisoning Attack through LLM Activations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18948v1)** | 2024-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Large Language Models (LLMs) are progressively deployed across diverse fields and real-world applications, ensuring the security and robustness of LLMs has become ever more critical. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a cutting-edge approach designed to address the limitations of large language models (LLMs). By retrieving information from the relevant knowledge database, RAG enriches the input to LLMs, enabling them to produce responses that are more accurate and contextually appropriate. It is worth noting that the knowledge database, being sourced from publicly available channels such as Wikipedia, inevitably introduces a new attack surface. RAG poisoning involves injecting malicious texts into the knowledge database, ultimately leading to the generation of the attacker's target response (also called poisoned response). However, there are currently limited methods available for detecting such poisoning attacks. We aim to bridge the gap in this work. Particularly, we introduce RevPRAG, a flexible and automated detection pipeline that leverages the activations of LLMs for poisoned response detection. Our investigation uncovers distinct patterns in LLMs' activations when generating correct responses versus poisoned responses. Our results on multiple benchmark datasets and RAG architectures show our approach could achieve 98% true positive rate, while maintaining false positive rates close to 1%. We also evaluate recent backdoor detection methods specifically designed for LLMs and applicable for identifying poisoned responses in RAG. The results demonstrate that our approach significantly surpasses them.</p></details> |  |

Leveraging multiple platforms, including 360doc, we gathered over 5,000 TCM clinical cases, performed data cleaning, and structured the dataset with crucial fields such as patient details, pathogenesis, syndromes, and annotations. Using the $Baidu\_ERNIE\_Speed\_128K$ API, we removed redundant information and generated the final answers through the $DeepSeekv2$ API, outputting results in standard JSON format. We optimized data recall with RAG and rerank techniques during retrieval and developed a hybrid matching scheme. By combining two-stage retrieval method with keyword matching via Jieba, we significantly enhanced the accuracy of model outputs.</p></details> |  |
| **[DMQR-RAG: Diverse Multi-Query Rewriting for RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13154v1)** | 2024-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models often encounter challenges with static knowledge and hallucinations, which undermine their reliability. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mitigates these issues by incorporating external information. However, user queries frequently contain noise and intent deviations, necessitating query rewriting to improve the relevance of retrieved documents. In this paper, we introduce DMQR-RAG, a Diverse Multi-Query Rewriting framework designed to improve the performance of both document retrieval and final responses in RAG. Specifically, we investigate how queries with varying information quantities can retrieve a diverse array of documents, presenting four rewriting strategies that operate at different levels of information to enhance the performance of baseline approaches. Additionally, we propose an adaptive strategy selection method that minimizes the number of rewrites while optimizing overall performance. Our methods have been rigorously validated through extensive experiments conducted in both academic and industry settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[ChunkRAG: Novel LLM-Chunk Filtering Method for RAG Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19572v4)** | 2024-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems using large language models (LLMs) often generate inaccurate responses due to the retrieval of irrelevant or loosely related information. Existing methods, which operate at the document level, fail to effectively filter out such content. We propose LLM-driven chunk filtering, ChunkRAG, a framework that enhances RAG systems by evaluating and filtering retrieved information at the chunk level. Our approach employs semantic chunking to divide documents into coherent sections and utilizes LLM-based relevance scoring to assess each chunk's alignment with the user's query. By filtering out less pertinent chunks before the generation phase, we significantly reduce hallucinations and improve factual accuracy. Experiments show that our method outperforms existing RAG models, achieving higher accuracy on tasks requiring precise information retrieval. This advancement enhances the reliability of RAG systems, making them particularly beneficial for applications like fact-checking and multi-hop reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Head RAG: Solving Multi-Aspect Problems with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05085v2)** | 2024-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances the abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by enabling the retrieval of documents into the LLM context to provide more accurate and relevant responses. Existing RAG solutions do not focus on queries that may require fetching multiple documents with substantially different contents. Such queries occur frequently, but are challenging because the embeddings of these documents may be distant in the embedding space, making it hard to retrieve them all. This paper introduces Multi-Head RAG (MRAG), a novel scheme designed to address this gap with a simple yet powerful idea: leveraging activations of Transformer's multi-head attention layer, instead of the decoder layer, as keys for fetching multi-aspect documents. The driving motivation is that different attention heads can learn to capture different data aspects. Harnessing the corresponding activations results in embeddings that represent various facets of data items and queries, improving the retrieval accuracy for complex queries. We provide an evaluation methodology and metrics, multi-aspect datasets that we release online, and real-world use cases to demonstrate MRAG's effectiveness, showing improvements of up to 20% in relevance over standard RAG baselines. MRAG can be seamlessly integrated with existing RAG frameworks and benchmarking tools like RAGAS as well as different classes of data stores.</p></details> |  |
| **[ERATTA: Extreme RAG for Table To Answers with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03963v4)** | 2024-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) with retrieval augmented-generation (RAG) have been the optimal choice for scalable generative AI solutions in the recent past. Although RAG implemented with AI agents (agentic-RAG) has been recently popularized, its suffers from unstable cost and unreliable performances for Enterprise-level data-practices. Most existing use-cases that incorporate RAG with LLMs have been either generic or extremely domain specific, thereby questioning the scalability and generalizability of RAG-LLM approaches. In this work, we propose a unique LLM-based system where multiple LLMs can be invoked to enable data authentication, user-query routing, data-retrieval and custom prompting for question-answering capabilities from Enterprise-data tables. The source tables here are highly fluctuating and large in size and the proposed framework enables structured responses in under 10 seconds per query. Additionally, we propose a five metric scoring module that detects and reports hallucinations in the LLM responses. Our proposed system and scoring metrics achieve >90% confidence scores across hundreds of user queries in the sustainability, financial health and social media domains. Extensions to the proposed extreme RAG architectures can enable heterogeneous source querying using LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 4 tables, IEEE Big Data, 2024</p></details> |
| **[Initial Nugget Evaluation Results for the TREC 2024 RAG Track with the AutoNuggetizer Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09607v1)** | 2024-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This report provides an initial look at partial results from the TREC 2024 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Track. We have identified RAG evaluation as a barrier to continued progress in information access (and more broadly, natural language processing and artificial intelligence), and it is our hope that we can contribute to tackling the many challenges in this space. The central hypothesis we explore in this work is that the nugget evaluation methodology, originally developed for the TREC Question Answering Track in 2003, provides a solid foundation for evaluating RAG systems. As such, our efforts have focused on "refactoring" this methodology, specifically applying large language models to both automatically create nuggets and to automatically assign nuggets to system answers. We call this the AutoNuggetizer framework. Within the TREC setup, we are able to calibrate our fully automatic process against a manual process whereby nuggets are created by human assessors semi-manually and then assigned manually to system answers. Based on initial results across 21 topics from 45 runs, we observe a strong correlation between scores derived from a fully automatic nugget evaluation and a (mostly) manual nugget evaluation by human assessors. This suggests that our fully automatic evaluation process can be used to guide future iterations of RAG systems.</p></details> |  |

We evaluate four LLMs-GPT-4o, LLAMA3, Mistral, and Mixtral -- comparing their answering accuracy and execution time. Our results demonstrate that while GPT-4 offers superior performance, LLAMA3 and Mistral also show promising capabilities for local deployment, addressing data privacy concerns in automotive applications.

Two separate systems form the RAG pipeline, the retriever and the reader, and the impact of each on downstream task performance is not well-understood. Here, we work towards the goal of understanding how retrievers can be optimized for RAG pipelines for common tasks such as Question Answering (QA). We conduct experiments focused on the relationship between retrieval and RAG performance on QA and attributed QA and unveil a number of insights useful to practitioners developing high-performance RAG pipelines. For example, lowering search accuracy has minor implications for RAG performance while potentially increasing retrieval speed and memory efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2024 Workshop ATTRIB</p></details> |
| **[LLM-R: A Framework for Domain-Adaptive Maintenance Scheme Generation Combining Hierarchical Agents and RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04476v1)** | 2024-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing use of smart devices has emphasized the critical role of maintenance in production activities. Interactive Electronic Technical Manuals (IETMs) are vital tools that support the maintenance of smart equipment. However, traditional IETMs face challenges such as transitioning from Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) to natural Language User Interfaces (LUIs) and managing complex logical relationships. Additionally, they must meet the current demands for higher intelligence. This paper proposes a Maintenance Scheme Generation Method based on Large Language Models (LLM-R). The proposed method includes several key innovations: We propose the Low Rank Adaptation-Knowledge Retention (LORA-KR) loss technology to proportionally adjust mixed maintenance data for fine-tuning the LLM. This method prevents knowledge conflicts caused by mixed data, improving the model's adaptability and reasoning ability in specific maintenance domains, Besides, Hierarchical Task-Based Agent and Instruction-level Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technologies are adopted to optimize the generation steps and mitigate the phenomenon of hallucination caused by the model's Inability to access contextual information. This enhancement improves the model's flexibility and accuracy in handling known or unknown maintenance objects and maintenance scheme scenarios. To validate the proposed method's effectiveness in maintenance tasks, a maintenance scheme dataset was constructed using objects from different fields. The experimental results show that the accuracy of the maintenance schemes generated by the proposed method reached 91.59%, indicating which improvement enhances the intelligence of maintenance schemes and introduces novel technical approaches for equipment maintenance.</p></details> | 30 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Enhancing classroom teaching with LLMs and RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04341v1)** | 2024-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models have become a valuable source of information for our daily inquiries. However, after training, its data source quickly becomes out-of-date, making RAG a useful tool for providing even more recent or pertinent data. In this work, we investigate how RAG pipelines, with the course materials serving as a data source, might help students in K-12 education. The initial research utilizes Reddit as a data source for up-to-date cybersecurity information. Chunk size is evaluated to determine the optimal amount of context needed to generate accurate answers. After running the experiment for different chunk sizes, answer correctness was evaluated using RAGAs with average answer correctness not exceeding 50 percent for any chunk size. This suggests that Reddit is not a good source to mine for data for questions about cybersecurity threats. The methodology was successful in evaluating the data source, which has implications for its use to evaluate educational resources for effectiveness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Advanced RAG Models with Graph Structures: Optimizing Complex Knowledge Reasoning and Text Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03572v1)** | 2024-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study aims to optimize the existing retrieval-augmented generation model (RAG) by introducing a graph structure to improve the performance of the model in dealing with complex knowledge reasoning tasks. The traditional RAG model has the problem of insufficient processing efficiency when facing complex graph structure information (such as knowledge graphs, hierarchical relationships, etc.), which affects the quality and consistency of the generated results. This study proposes a scheme to process graph structure data by combining graph neural network (GNN), so that the model can capture the complex relationship between entities, thereby improving the knowledge consistency and reasoning ability of the generated text. The experiment used the Natural Questions (NQ) dataset and compared it with multiple existing generation models. The results show that the graph-based RAG model proposed in this paper is superior to the traditional generation model in terms of quality, knowledge consistency, and reasoning ability, especially when dealing with tasks that require multi-dimensional reasoning. Through the combination of the enhancement of the retrieval module and the graph neural network, the model in this study can better handle complex knowledge background information and has broad potential value in multiple practical application scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Long Context RAG Performance of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03538v1)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a crucial technique for enhancing the accuracy of Large Language Models (LLMs) by incorporating external information. With the advent of LLMs that support increasingly longer context lengths, there is a growing interest in understanding how these models perform in RAG scenarios. Can these new long context models improve RAG performance? This paper presents a comprehensive study of the impact of increased context length on RAG performance across 20 popular open source and commercial LLMs. We ran RAG workflows while varying the total context length from 2,000 to 128,000 tokens (and 2 million tokens when possible) on three domain-specific datasets, and report key insights on the benefits and limitations of long context in RAG applications. Our findings reveal that while retrieving more documents can improve performance, only a handful of the most recent state of the art LLMs can maintain consistent accuracy at long context above 64k tokens. We also identify distinct failure modes in long context scenarios, suggesting areas for future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>2024 ...</summary><p>2024 NeurIPS workshop on Adaptive Foundation Models: Evolving AI for Personalized and Efficient Learning</p></details> |

WASHtsApp leverages a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach to address the limitations of previous approaches with limited reach or missing contextualization. The paper details the development process, employing Design Science Research Methodology. The evaluation consisted of two phases: content validation by four WASH experts and community validation by potential users. Content validation confirmed WASHtsApp's ability to provide accurate and relevant WASH-related information. Community validation indicated high user acceptance and perceived usefulness of the chatbot. The paper concludes by discussing the potential for further development, including incorporating local languages and user data analysis for targeted interventions. It also proposes future research cycles focused on wider deployment and leveraging user data for educational purposes.</p></details> | Working Paper |
| **[CRAG -- Comprehensive RAG Benchmark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04744v2)** | 2024-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has recently emerged as a promising solution to alleviate Large Language Model (LLM)'s deficiency in lack of knowledge. Existing RAG datasets, however, do not adequately represent the diverse and dynamic nature of real-world Question Answering (QA) tasks. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Comprehensive RAG Benchmark (CRAG), a factual question answering benchmark of 4,409 question-answer pairs and mock APIs to simulate web and Knowledge Graph (KG) search. CRAG is designed to encapsulate a diverse array of questions across five domains and eight question categories, reflecting varied entity popularity from popular to long-tail, and temporal dynamisms ranging from years to seconds. Our evaluation of this benchmark highlights the gap to fully trustworthy QA. Whereas most advanced LLMs achieve <=34% accuracy on CRAG, adding RAG in a straightforward manner improves the accuracy only to 44%. State-of-the-art industry RAG solutions only answer 63% of questions without any hallucination. CRAG also reveals much lower accuracy in answering questions regarding facts with higher dynamism, lower popularity, or higher complexity, suggesting future research directions. The CRAG benchmark laid the groundwork for a KDD Cup 2024 challenge and attracted thousands of participants and submissions. We commit to maintaining CRAG to serve research communities in advancing RAG solutions and general QA solutions.

| **[Emotional RAG: Enhancing Role-Playing Agents through Emotional Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23041v1)** | 2024-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As LLMs exhibit a high degree of human-like capability, increasing attention has been paid to role-playing research areas in which responses generated by LLMs are expected to mimic human replies. This has promoted the exploration of role-playing agents in various applications, such as chatbots that can engage in natural conversations with users and virtual assistants that can provide personalized support and guidance. The crucial factor in the role-playing task is the effective utilization of character memory, which stores characters' profiles, experiences, and historical dialogues. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) technology is used to access the related memory to enhance the response generation of role-playing agents. Most existing studies retrieve related information based on the semantic similarity of memory to maintain characters' personalized traits, and few attempts have been made to incorporate the emotional factor in the retrieval argument generation (RAG) of LLMs. Inspired by the Mood-Dependent Memory theory, which indicates that people recall an event better if they somehow reinstate during recall the original emotion they experienced during learning, we propose a novel emotion-aware memory retrieval framework, termed Emotional RAG, which recalls the related memory with consideration of emotional state in role-playing agents. Specifically, we design two kinds of retrieval strategies, i.e., combination strategy and sequential strategy, to incorporate both memory semantic and emotional states during the retrieval process. Extensive experiments on three representative role-playing datasets demonstrate that our Emotional RAG framework outperforms the method without considering the emotional factor in maintaining the personalities of role-playing agents. This provides evidence to further reinforce the Mood-Dependent Memory theory in psychology.</p></details> |  |

To enhance generation, we propose a two-stage instruction tuning method that significantly boosts the performance of RAG. For effective retrieval, we introduce a dense retriever optimized for conversational QA, which yields results comparable to the alternative state-of-the-art query rewriting models, while substantially reducing deployment costs. We also present the ChatRAG Bench, which encompasses ten datasets covering comprehensive evaluations on RAG, table-related QA, arithmetic calculations, and scenarios involving unanswerable questions. Our ChatQA-1.0-70B (score: 54.14), built on Llama2, a weaker foundation model than GPT-4, can slightly outperform GPT-4-0613 (score: 53.90) and GPT-4-Turbo-2024-04-09 (score: 54.03) on the ChatRAG Bench, without relying on any synthetic data from OpenAI GPT models. Notably, the Llama3-ChatQA-1.5-70B model surpasses the accuracy of GPT-4-Turbo-2024-04-09, achieving a 4.4% improvement. To advance research in this field, we open-sourced the model weights, instruction tuning data, ChatRAG Bench, and retriever for the community: https://chatqa-project.github.io/.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |
| **[Context Embeddings for Efficient Answer Generation in RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09252v3)** | 2024-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) allows overcoming the limited knowledge of LLMs by extending the input with external information. As a consequence, the contextual inputs to the model become much longer which slows down decoding time directly translating to the time a user has to wait for an answer. We address this challenge by presenting COCOM, an effective context compression method, reducing long contexts to only a handful of Context Embeddings speeding up the generation time by a large margin. Our method allows for different compression rates trading off decoding time for answer quality. Compared to earlier methods, COCOM allows for handling multiple contexts more effectively, significantly reducing decoding time for long inputs. Our method demonstrates a speed-up of up to 5.69 $\times$ while achieving higher performance compared to existing efficient context compression methods.</p></details> | 10 pages |

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is one approach to address these challenges, while multimodal models are emerging as promising AI assistants for processing both text and images. In this paper we describe a series of experiments aimed at determining how to best integrate multimodal models into RAG systems for the industrial domain. The purpose of the experiments is to determine whether including images alongside text from documents within the industrial domain increases RAG performance and to find the optimal configuration for such a multimodal RAG system. Our experiments include two approaches for image processing and retrieval, as well as two LLMs (GPT4-Vision and LLaVA) for answer synthesis. These image processing strategies involve the use of multimodal embeddings and the generation of textual summaries from images. We evaluate our experiments with an LLM-as-a-Judge approach. Our results reveal that multimodal RAG can outperform single-modality RAG settings, although image retrieval poses a greater challenge than text retrieval. Additionally, leveraging textual summaries from images presents a more promising approach compared to the use of multimodal embeddings, providing more opportunities for future advancements.</p></details> |  |

However, as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems expand, they encounter significant challenges related to scalability, including increased delay and communication overhead. To address these issues, we propose EACO-RAG, an edge-assisted distributed RAG system that leverages adaptive knowledge updates and inter-node collaboration. By distributing vector datasets across edge nodes and optimizing retrieval processes, EACO-RAG significantly reduces delay and resource consumption while enhancing response accuracy. The system employs a multi-armed bandit framework with safe online Bayesian methods to balance performance and cost. Extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that EACO-RAG outperforms traditional centralized RAG systems in both response time and resource efficiency. EACO-RAG effectively reduces delay and resource expenditure to levels comparable to, or even lower than, those of local RAG systems, while significantly improving accuracy. This study presents the first systematic exploration of edge-assisted distributed RAG architectures, providing a scalable and cost-effective solution for large-scale distributed environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[ConfusedPilot: Confused Deputy Risks in RAG-based LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04870v5)** | 2024-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) is a process where a large language model (LLM) retrieves useful information from a database and then generates the responses. It is becoming popular in enterprise settings for daily business operations. For example, Copilot for Microsoft 365 has accumulated millions of businesses. However, the security implications of adopting such RAG-based systems are unclear. In this paper, we introduce ConfusedPilot, a class of security vulnerabilities of RAG systems that confuse Copilot and cause integrity and confidentiality violations in its responses. First, we investigate a vulnerability that embeds malicious text in the modified prompt in RAG, corrupting the responses generated by the LLM. Second, we demonstrate a vulnerability that leaks secret data, which leverages the caching mechanism during retrieval. Third, we investigate how both vulnerabilities can be exploited to propagate misinformation within the enterprise and ultimately impact its operations, such as sales and manufacturing. We also discuss the root cause of these attacks by investigating the architecture of a RAG-based system. This study highlights the security vulnerabilities in today's RAG-based systems and proposes design guidelines to secure future RAG-based systems.</p></details> |  |

However, scaling tool capacity beyond agent reasoning or model limits remains a challenge. In this paper, we address these challenges by introducing Toolshed Knowledge Bases, a tool knowledge base (vector database) designed to store enhanced tool representations and optimize tool selection for large-scale tool-equipped Agents. Additionally, we propose Advanced RAG-Tool Fusion, a novel ensemble of tool-applied advanced retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques across the pre-retrieval, intra-retrieval, and post-retrieval phases, without requiring model fine-tuning. During pre-retrieval, tool documents are enhanced with key information and stored in the Toolshed Knowledge Base. Intra-retrieval focuses on query planning and transformation to increase retrieval accuracy. Post-retrieval refines the retrieved tool documents and enables self-reflection. Furthermore, by varying both the total number of tools (tool-M) an Agent has access to and the tool selection threshold (top-k), we address trade-offs between retrieval accuracy, agent performance, and token cost. Our approach achieves 46%, 56%, and 47% absolute improvements on the ToolE single-tool, ToolE multi-tool and Seal-Tools benchmark datasets, respectively (Recall@5).</p></details> |  |

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a promising solution for addressing the limitations of LLMs, yet existing studies on the robustness of RAG often overlook the interconnected relationships between RAG components or the potential threats prevalent in real-world databases, such as minor textual errors. In this work, we investigate two underexplored aspects when assessing the robustness of RAG: 1) vulnerability to noisy documents through low-level perturbations and 2) a holistic evaluation of RAG robustness. Furthermore, we introduce a novel attack method, the Genetic Attack on RAG (\textit{GARAG}), which targets these aspects. Specifically, GARAG is designed to reveal vulnerabilities within each component and test the overall system functionality against noisy documents. We validate RAG robustness by applying our \textit{GARAG} to standard QA datasets, incorporating diverse retrievers and LLMs. The experimental results show that GARAG consistently achieves high attack success rates. Also, it significantly devastates the performance of each component and their synergy, highlighting the substantial risk that minor textual inaccuracies pose in disrupting RAG systems in the real world.</p></details> | <details><summary>Findi...</summary><p>Findings of EMNLP Camera-ready version</p></details> |

However, these modules are usually separately trained. We argue that a system like RAG that incorporates multiple modules should be jointly optimized to achieve optimal performance. To demonstrate this, we design a specific pipeline called \textbf{SmartRAG} that includes a policy network and a retriever. The policy network can serve as 1) a decision maker that decides when to retrieve, 2) a query rewriter to generate a query most suited to the retriever, and 3) an answer generator that produces the final response with/without the observations. We then propose to jointly optimize the whole system using a reinforcement learning algorithm, with the reward designed to encourage the system to achieve the best performance with minimal retrieval cost. When jointly optimized, all the modules can be aware of how other modules are working and thus find the best way to work together as a complete system. Empirical results demonstrate that the jointly optimized SmartRAG can achieve better performance than separately optimized counterparts.</p></details> |  |

We consider the notion of (approximate) maximin share (MMS) and we provide an improved lower bound of $1/2$ (which is tight) for the case of subadditive valuations when the number of agents is at most four. We also provide a tight lower bound for the case of multiple agents, when they are equipped with one of two possible types of valuations. Moreover, we propose a new model that extends previously studied models in the area of fair division, which will hopefully give rise to further research. We demonstrate the usefulness of this model by employing it as a technical tool to derive our main result, and we provide a thorough analysis for this model for the case of three agents. Finally, we provide an improved impossibility result for the case of three submodular agents.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we design a distributed framework for safe multi-agent control in large-scale environments with obstacles, where a large number of agents are required to maintain safety using only local information and reach their goal locations. We introduce a new class of certificates, termed graph control barrier function (GCBF), which are based on the well-established control barrier function theory for safety guarantees and utilize a graph structure for scalable and generalizable distributed control of MAS. We develop a novel theoretical framework to prove the safety of an arbitrary-sized MAS with a single GCBF. We propose a new training framework GCBF+ that uses graph neural networks to parameterize a candidate GCBF and a distributed control policy. The proposed framework is distributed and is capable of taking point clouds from LiDAR, instead of actual state information, for real-world robotic applications. We illustrate the efficacy of the proposed method through various hardware experiments on a swarm of drones with objectives ranging from exchanging positions to docking on a moving target without collision. Additionally, we perform extensive numerical experiments, where the number and density of agents, as well as the number of obstacles, increase. Empirical results show that in complex environments with agents with nonlinear dynamics (e.g., Crazyflie drones), GCBF+ outperforms the hand-crafted CBF-based method with the best performance by up to 20% for relatively small-scale MAS with up to 256 agents, and leading reinforcement learning (RL) methods by up to 40% for MAS with 1024 agents. Furthermore, the proposed method does not compromise on the performance, in terms of goal reaching, for achieving high safety rates, which is a common trade-off in RL-based methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 15 figures; Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Robotics (T-RO)</p></details> |

Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in automating code generation to transform tabular data into accessible visualizations. However, they often struggle with complex queries that require reasoning across multiple tables. To address this limitation, we propose a collaborative agent workflow, termed nvAgent, for NL2Vis. Specifically, nvAgent comprises three agents: a processor agent for database processing and context filtering, a composer agent for planning visualization generation, and a validator agent for code translation and output verification. Comprehensive evaluations on the new VisEval benchmark demonstrate that nvAgent consistently surpasses state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a 7.88% improvement in single-table and a 9.23% improvement in multi-table scenarios. Qualitative analyses further highlight that nvAgent maintains nearly a 20% performance margin over previous models, underscoring its capacity to produce high-quality visual representations from complex, heterogeneous data sources.</p></details> |  |
| **[Near-Optimal Online Learning for Multi-Agent Submodular Coordination: Tight Approximation and Communication Efficiency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05028v1)** | 2025-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Coordinating multiple agents to collaboratively maximize submodular functions in unpredictable environments is a critical task with numerous applications in machine learning, robot planning and control. The existing approaches, such as the OSG algorithm, are often hindered by their poor approximation guarantees and the rigid requirement for a fully connected communication graph. To address these challenges, we firstly present a $\textbf{MA-OSMA}$ algorithm, which employs the multi-linear extension to transfer the discrete submodular maximization problem into a continuous optimization, thereby allowing us to reduce the strict dependence on a complete graph through consensus techniques. Moreover, $\textbf{MA-OSMA}$ leverages a novel surrogate gradient to avoid sub-optimal stationary points. To eliminate the computationally intensive projection operations in $\textbf{MA-OSMA}$, we also introduce a projection-free $\textbf{MA-OSEA}$ algorithm, which effectively utilizes the KL divergence by mixing a uniform distribution. Theoretically, we confirm that both algorithms achieve a regret bound of $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{\frac{C_{T}T}{1-\beta}})$ against a $(\frac{1-e^{-c}}{c})$-approximation to the best comparator in hindsight, where $C_{T}$ is the deviation of maximizer sequence, $\beta$ is the spectral gap of the network and $c$ is the joint curvature of submodular objectives. This result significantly improves the $(\frac{1}{1+c})$-approximation provided by the state-of-the-art OSG algorithm. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms through simulation-based multi-target tracking.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025</p></details> |

However, while code generation with Large Language Models (LLMs) is an extraordinarily active research area, test generation remains relatively unexplored. We address this gap and investigate the capability of LLM-based Code Agents to formalize user issues into test cases. To this end, we propose a novel benchmark based on popular GitHub repositories, containing real-world issues, ground-truth bug-fixes, and golden tests. We find that LLMs generally perform surprisingly well at generating relevant test cases, with Code Agents designed for code repair exceeding the performance of systems designed specifically for test generation. Further, as test generation is a similar but more structured task than code generation, it allows for a more fine-grained analysis using issue reproduction rate and coverage changes, providing a dual metric for analyzing systems designed for code repair. Finally, we find that generated tests are an effective filter for proposed code fixes, doubling the precision of SWE-Agent.

| **[$TAR^2$: Temporal-Agent Reward Redistribution for Optimal Policy Preservation in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04864v1)** | 2025-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), learning effective policies is challenging when global rewards are sparse and delayed. This difficulty arises from the need to assign credit across both agents and time steps, a problem that existing methods often fail to address in episodic, long-horizon tasks. We propose Temporal-Agent Reward Redistribution $TAR^2$, a novel approach that decomposes sparse global rewards into agent-specific, time-step-specific components, thereby providing more frequent and accurate feedback for policy learning. Theoretically, we show that $TAR^2$ (i) aligns with potential-based reward shaping, preserving the same optimal policies as the original environment, and (ii) maintains policy gradient update directions identical to those under the original sparse reward, ensuring unbiased credit signals. Empirical results on two challenging benchmarks, SMACLite and Google Research Football, demonstrate that $TAR^2$ significantly stabilizes and accelerates convergence, outperforming strong baselines like AREL and STAS in both learning speed and final performance. These findings establish $TAR^2$ as a principled and practical solution for agent-temporal credit assignment in sparse-reward multi-agent systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 5 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[HyperMARL: Adaptive Hypernetworks for Multi-Agent RL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04233v2)** | 2025-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adaptability is critical in cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), where agents must learn specialised or homogeneous behaviours for diverse tasks. While parameter sharing methods are sample-efficient, they often encounter gradient interference among agents, limiting their behavioural diversity. Conversely, non-parameter sharing approaches enable specialisation, but are computationally demanding and sample-inefficient. To address these issues, we propose HyperMARL, a parameter sharing approach that uses hypernetworks to dynamically generate agent-specific actor and critic parameters, without altering the learning objective or requiring preset diversity levels. By decoupling observation- and agent-conditioned gradients, HyperMARL empirically reduces policy gradient variance and facilitates specialisation within FuPS, suggesting it can mitigate cross-agent interference. Across multiple MARL benchmarks involving up to twenty agents -- and requiring homogeneous, heterogeneous, or mixed behaviours -- HyperMARL consistently performs competitively with fully shared, non-parameter-sharing, and diversity-promoting baselines, all while preserving a behavioural diversity level comparable to non-parameter sharing. These findings establish hypernetworks as a versatile approach for MARL across diverse environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Assigning Credit with Partial Reward Decoupling in Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04295v3)** | 2025-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent proximal policy optimization (MAPPO) has recently demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on challenging multi-agent reinforcement learning tasks. However, MAPPO still struggles with the credit assignment problem, wherein the sheer difficulty in ascribing credit to individual agents' actions scales poorly with team size. In this paper, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm that adapts recent developments in credit assignment to improve upon MAPPO. Our approach leverages partial reward decoupling (PRD), which uses a learned attention mechanism to estimate which of a particular agent's teammates are relevant to its learning updates. We use this estimate to dynamically decompose large groups of agents into smaller, more manageable subgroups. We empirically demonstrate that our approach, PRD-MAPPO, decouples agents from teammates that do not influence their expected future reward, thereby streamlining credit assignment. We additionally show that PRD-MAPPO yields significantly higher data efficiency and asymptotic performance compared to both MAPPO and other state-of-the-art methods across several multi-agent tasks, including StarCraft II. Finally, we propose a version of PRD-MAPPO that is applicable to \textit{shared} reward settings, where PRD was previously not applicable, and empirically show that this also leads to performance improvements over MAPPO.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 5 figures, 12 tables, Reinforcement Learning Journal and Reinforcement Learning Conference 2024</p></details> |
| **[Humans Co-exist, So Must Embodied Artificial Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04809v1)** | 2025-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern embodied artificial agents excel in static, predefined tasks but fall short in dynamic and long-term interactions with humans. On the other hand, humans can adapt and evolve continuously, exploiting the situated knowledge embedded in their environment and other agents, thus contributing to meaningful interactions. We introduce the concept of co-existence for embodied artificial agents and argues that it is a prerequisite for meaningful, long-term interaction with humans. We take inspiration from biology and design theory to understand how human and non-human organisms foster entities that co-exist within their specific niches. Finally, we propose key research directions for the machine learning community to foster co-existing embodied agents, focusing on the principles, hardware and learning methods responsible for shaping them.</p></details> |  |
| **[Counterfactual Effect Decomposition in Multi-Agent Sequential Decision Making](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12539v2)** | 2025-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We address the challenge of explaining counterfactual outcomes in multi-agent Markov decision processes. In particular, we aim to explain the total counterfactual effect of an agent's action on the outcome of a realized scenario through its influence on the environment dynamics and the agents' behavior. To achieve this, we introduce a novel causal explanation formula that decomposes the counterfactual effect by attributing to each agent and state variable a score reflecting their respective contributions to the effect. First, we show that the total counterfactual effect of an agent's action can be decomposed into two components: one measuring the effect that propagates through all subsequent agents' actions and another related to the effect that propagates through the state transitions. Building on recent advancements in causal contribution analysis, we further decompose these two effects as follows. For the former, we consider agent-specific effects -- a causal concept that quantifies the counterfactual effect of an agent's action that propagates through a subset of agents. Based on this notion, we use Shapley value to attribute the effect to individual agents. For the latter, we consider the concept of structure-preserving interventions and attribute the effect to state variables based on their "intrinsic" contributions. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate the interpretability of our approach in a Gridworld environment with LLM-assisted agents and a sepsis management simulator.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards shutdownable agents via stochastic choice](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00805v3)** | 2025-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Some worry that advanced artificial agents may resist being shut down. The Incomplete Preferences Proposal (IPP) is an idea for ensuring that doesn't happen. A key part of the IPP is using a novel 'Discounted REward for Same-Length Trajectories (DREST)' reward function to train agents to (1) pursue goals effectively conditional on each trajectory-length (be 'USEFUL'), and (2) choose stochastically between different trajectory-lengths (be 'NEUTRAL' about trajectory-lengths). In this paper, we propose evaluation metrics for USEFULNESS and NEUTRALITY. We use a DREST reward function to train simple agents to navigate gridworlds, and we find that these agents learn to be USEFUL and NEUTRAL. Our results thus suggest that DREST reward functions could also train advanced agents to be USEFUL and NEUTRAL, and thereby make these advanced agents useful and shutdownable.</p></details> |  |
| **[S$^2$-MAD: Breaking the Token Barrier to Enhance Multi-Agent Debate Efficiency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04790v1)** | 2025-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various natural language processing (NLP) scenarios, but they still face challenges when handling complex arithmetic and logical reasoning tasks. While Chain-Of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, self-consistency (SC) and self-correction strategies have attempted to guide models in sequential, multi-step reasoning, Multi-agent Debate (MAD) has emerged as a viable approach for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. By increasing both the number of agents and the frequency of debates, the performance of LLMs improves significantly. However, this strategy results in a significant increase in token costs, presenting a barrier to scalability. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel sparsification strategy designed to reduce token costs within MAD. This approach minimizes ineffective exchanges of information and unproductive discussions among agents, thereby enhancing the overall efficiency of the debate process. We conduct comparative experiments on multiple datasets across various models, demonstrating that our approach significantly reduces the token costs in MAD to a considerable extent. Specifically, compared to MAD, our approach achieves an impressive reduction of up to 94.5\% in token costs while maintaining performance degradation below 2.0\%.</p></details> | 16 pages, 5 figures |

However, these systems often rely on fragile, manually designed prompts and heuristics, making optimization difficult. A key challenge in optimizing multi-agent systems is acquiring suitable training data for specialized agents. We introduce SiriuS, a self-improving, reasoning-driven optimization framework for multi-agent systems. Central to our approach is the construction of an experience library: a repository of high-quality reasoning trajectories. The library is built by retaining reasoning steps that lead to successful outcomes, providing a robust training set for optimizing multi-agent system. Additionally, we introduce a library augmentation procedure that refines unsuccessful trajectories, further enriching the library. SiriuS boosts performance by 2.86\% to 21.88\% on reasoning and biomedical QA and enhances agent negotiation in competitive settings. Our results show that SiriuS enhances multi-agent performance while generating reusable data for self-correction and self-play enhancement in the future.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Extended Benchmarking of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Algorithms in Complex Fully Cooperative Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04773v1)** | 2025-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) has recently emerged as a significant area of research. However, MARL evaluation often lacks systematic diversity, hindering a comprehensive understanding of algorithms' capabilities. In particular, cooperative MARL algorithms are predominantly evaluated on benchmarks such as SMAC and GRF, which primarily feature team game scenarios without assessing adequately various aspects of agents' capabilities required in fully cooperative real-world tasks such as multi-robot cooperation and warehouse, resource management, search and rescue, and human-AI cooperation. Moreover, MARL algorithms are mainly evaluated on low dimensional state spaces, and thus their performance on high-dimensional (e.g., image) observations is not well-studied. To fill this gap, this paper highlights the crucial need for expanding systematic evaluation across a wider array of existing benchmarks. To this end, we conduct extensive evaluation and comparisons of well-known MARL algorithms on complex fully cooperative benchmarks, including tasks with images as agents' observations. Interestingly, our analysis shows that many algorithms, hailed as state-of-the-art on SMAC and GRF, may underperform standard MARL baselines on fully cooperative benchmarks. Finally, towards more systematic and better evaluation of cooperative MARL algorithms, we have open-sourced PyMARLzoo+, an extension of the widely used (E)PyMARL libraries, which addresses an open challenge from [TBG++21], facilitating seamless integration and support with all benchmarks of PettingZoo, as well as Overcooked, PressurePlate, Capture Target and Box Pushing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Every Software as an Agent: Blueprint and Case Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04747v1)** | 2025-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of (multimodal) large language models (LLMs) has shed light on software agent -- where software can understand and follow user instructions in natural language. However, existing approaches such as API-based and GUI-based agents are far from satisfactory at accuracy and efficiency aspects. Instead, we advocate to endow LLMs with access to the software internals (source code and runtime context) and the permission to dynamically inject generated code into software for execution. In such a whitebox setting, one may better leverage the software context and the coding ability of LLMs. We then present an overall design architecture and case studies on two popular web-based desktop applications. We also give in-depth discussion of the challenges and future directions. We deem that such a new paradigm has the potential to fundamentally overturn the existing software agent design, and finally creating a digital world in which software can comprehend, operate, collaborate, and even think to meet complex user needs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Agent Coverage Control in Non-Convex Annulus Region with Conformal Mapping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04697v1)** | 2025-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficiently fulfilling coverage tasks in non-convex regions has long been a significant challenge for multi-agent systems (MASs). By leveraging conformal mapping, this paper introduces a novel sectorial coverage formulation to transform a non-convex annulus region into a topologically equivalent one. This approach enables the deployment of MASs in a non-star-shaped region while optimizing coverage performance and achieving load balance among sub-regions. It provides a unique perspective on the partitioned sub-regions to highlight the geodesic convex property of the non-star-shaped region. By utilizing the sectorial partition mechanism and the diffeomorphism property of conformal mapping, a decentralized control law is designed to drive MASs towards a desired configuration, which not only optimizes the global coverage cost but also ensures exponential convergence of equitable workload. Moreover, an iterative search algorithm is developed to identify the optimal approximation of multi-agent deployment in the non-star-shaped region. Theoretical analysis is conducted to confirm the asymptotic stability and global convergence with arbitrary small tolerance of the closed-loop system. Finally, numerical simulations demonstrate the practicality of the proposed coverage formulation with conformal mapping.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Strategic Language Agents in the Werewolf Game with Iterative Latent Space Policy Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04686v1)** | 2025-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM)-based agents have recently shown impressive progress in a variety of domains, including open-ended conversation and multi-step decision-making. However, applying these agents to social deduction games such as Werewolf, which requires both strategic decision-making and free-form language interaction, remains non-trivial. Traditional methods based on Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR) or reinforcement learning (RL) typically depend on a predefined action space, making them unsuitable for language games with unconstrained text action space. Meanwhile, pure LLM-based agents often suffer from intrinsic biases and require prohibitively large datasets for fine-tuning. We propose Latent Space Policy Optimization (LSPO), an iterative framework that addresses these challenges by first mapping free-form text to a discrete latent space, where methods like CFR and RL can learn strategic policy more effectively. We then translate the learned policy back into natural language dialogues, which are used to fine-tune an LLM via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). By iteratively alternating between these stages, our LSPO agent progressively enhances both strategic reasoning and language communication. Experiment results on the Werewolf game show that our method improves the agent's performance in each iteration and outperforms existing Werewolf agents, underscoring its promise for free-form language decision-making.</p></details> |  |

Unlike conventional LLM-based reasoning approaches, which rely solely on internal inference, Agentic Reasoning dynamically engages web search, code execution, and structured reasoning-context memory to solve complex problems requiring deep research and multi-step logical deduction. Our framework introduces the Mind Map agent, which constructs a structured knowledge graph to track logical relationships, improving deductive reasoning. Additionally, the integration of web-search and coding agents enables real-time retrieval and computational analysis, enhancing reasoning accuracy and decision-making. Evaluations on PhD-level scientific reasoning (GPQA) and domain-specific deep research tasks demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing models, including leading retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems and closed-source LLMs. Moreover, our results indicate that agentic reasoning improves expert-level knowledge synthesis, test-time scalability, and structured problem-solving.

Machine learning approaches only succeed in identifying the locations of these ``dark vessels'' in the immediate future. This work leverages ideas from the literature on abductive inference applied to locating adversarial agents to solve the problem. Specifically, we combine concepts from abduction, logic programming, and rule learning to create an efficient method that approaches full recall of dark vessels while requiring less search area than machine learning methods. We provide a logic-based paradigm for reasoning about maritime vessels, an abductive inference query method, an automatically extracted rule-based behavior model methodology, and a thorough suite of experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to 24th International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (AAMAS 2025)</p></details> |

This oversight presents a critical gap in understanding their effectiveness in real-world deployments, particularly when communicating with humans. Existing agentic benchmarks fail to address key aspects of inter-agent communication and collaboration, particularly in scenarios where agents have unequal access to information and must work together to achieve tasks beyond the scope of individual capabilities. To fill this gap, we introduce a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the collaborative performance of multimodal multi-agent systems through language communication. Our benchmark features a variety of scenarios, providing a comprehensive evaluation across four key categories of agentic capability in a communicative collaboration setting. By testing both agent-agent and agent-human collaborations using open-source and closed-source models, our findings reveal surprising weaknesses in state-of-the-art models, including proprietary models like GPT-4o. Some of these models struggle to outperform even a simple random agent baseline in agent-agent collaboration and only surpass the random baseline when a human is involved.</p></details> |  |
| **[Ensemble Value Functions for Efficient Exploration in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03439v7)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) requires agents to explore within a vast joint action space to find joint actions that lead to coordination. Existing value-based MARL algorithms commonly rely on random exploration, such as $\epsilon$-greedy, to explore the environment which is not systematic and inefficient at identifying effective actions in multi-agent problems. Additionally, the concurrent training of the policies of multiple agents during training can render the optimisation non-stationary. This can lead to unstable value estimates, highly variant gradients, and ultimately hinder coordination between agents. To address these challenges, we propose ensemble value functions for multi-agent exploration (EMAX). EMAX is a framework to seamlessly extend value-based MARL algorithms. EMAX leverages an ensemble of value functions for each agent to guide their exploration, reduce the variance of their optimisation, and makes their policies more robust to miscoordination. EMAX achieves these benefits by (1) systematically guiding the exploration of agents with a UCB policy towards parts of the environment that require multiple agents to coordinate. (2) EMAX computes average value estimates across the ensemble as target values to reduce the variance of gradients and make optimisation more stable. (3) During evaluation, EMAX selects actions following a majority vote across the ensemble to reduce the likelihood of miscoordination. We first instantiate independent DQN with EMAX and evaluate it in 11 general-sum tasks with sparse rewards. We show that EMAX improves final evaluation returns by 185% across all tasks. We then evaluate EMAX on top of IDQN, VDN and QMIX in 21 common-reward tasks, and show that EMAX improves sample efficiency and final evaluation returns across all tasks over all three vanilla algorithms by 60%, 47%, and 538%, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at 24th International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (AAMAS 2025)</p></details> |

In this paper, we introduce a focal diversity-optimized multi-agent reinforcement learning approach, coined as MARL-Focal, with three unique characteristics. First, we develop an agent-fusion framework for encouraging multiple LLM based agents to collaborate in producing the final inference output for each LLM query. Second, we develop a focal-diversity optimized agent selection algorithm that can choose a small subset of the available agents based on how well they can complement one another to generate the query output. Finally, we design a conflict-resolution method to detect output inconsistency among multiple agents and produce our MARL-Focal output through reward-aware and policy-adaptive inference fusion. Extensive evaluations on five benchmarks show that MARL-Focal is cost-efficient and adversarial-robust. Our multi-agent fusion model achieves performance improvement of 5.51\% compared to the best individual LLM-agent and offers stronger robustness over the TruthfulQA benchmark.

We formulate this broad class of problems as Distributed Evaluation, Centralized Allocation (DECA) problems and propose methods to learn fair and efficient policies in centralized resource allocation. Our methods are applied to learning long-term fairness in a novel and general framework for fairness in multi-agent systems. We show three different methods based on Double Deep Q-Learning: (1) A joint weighted optimization of fairness and utility, (2) a split optimization, learning two separate Q-estimators for utility and fairness, and (3) an online policy perturbation to guide existing black-box utility functions toward fair solutions. Our methods outperform existing fair MARL approaches on multiple resource allocation domains, even when evaluated using diverse fairness functions, and allow for flexible online trade-offs between utility and fairness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Free Energy Risk Metrics for Systemically Safe AI: Gatekeeping Multi-Agent Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04249v1)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the Free Energy Principle as a foundation for measuring risk in agentic and multi-agent systems. From these principles we introduce a Cumulative Risk Exposure metric that is flexible to differing contexts and needs. We contrast this to other popular theories for safe AI that hinge on massive amounts of data or describing arbitrarily complex world models. In our framework, stakeholders need only specify their preferences over system outcomes, providing straightforward and transparent decision rules for risk governance and mitigation. This framework naturally accounts for uncertainty in both world model and preference model, allowing for decision-making that is epistemically and axiologically humble, parsimonious, and future-proof. We demonstrate this novel approach in a simplified autonomous vehicle environment with multi-agent vehicles whose driving policies are mediated by gatekeepers that evaluate, in an online fashion, the risk to the collective safety in their neighborhood, and intervene through each vehicle's policy when appropriate. We show that the introduction of gatekeepers in an AV fleet, even at low penetration, can generate significant positive externalities in terms of increased system safety.</p></details> | 9 pages, 1 figure |

In support of this position, we build from prior scientific literature and current product marketing to delineate different AI agent levels and detail the ethical values at play in each, documenting trade-offs in potential benefits and risks. Our analysis reveals that risks to people increase with the autonomy of a system: The more control a user cedes to an AI agent, the more risks to people arise. Particularly concerning are safety risks, which affect human life and impact further values.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-agent Architecture Search via Agentic Supernet](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04180v1)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM)-empowered multi-agent systems extend the cognitive boundaries of individual agents through disciplined collaboration and interaction, while constructing these systems often requires labor-intensive manual designs. Despite the availability of methods to automate the design of agentic workflows, they typically seek to identify a static, complex, one-size-fits-all system, which, however, fails to dynamically allocate inference resources based on the difficulty and domain of each query. To address this challenge, we shift away from the pursuit of a monolithic agentic system, instead optimizing the \textbf{agentic supernet}, a probabilistic and continuous distribution of agentic architectures. We introduce MaAS, an automated framework that samples query-dependent agentic systems from the supernet, delivering high-quality solutions and tailored resource allocation (\textit{e.g.}, LLM calls, tool calls, token cost). Comprehensive evaluation across six benchmarks demonstrates that MaAS \textbf{(I)} requires only $6\sim45\%$ of the inference costs of existing handcrafted or automated multi-agent systems, \textbf{(II)} surpasses them by $0.54\%\sim11.82\%$, and \textbf{(III)} enjoys superior cross-dataset and cross-LLM-backbone transferability.</p></details> |  |
| **[G-Designer: Architecting Multi-agent Communication Topologies via Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11782v3)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in large language model (LLM)-based agents have demonstrated that collective intelligence can significantly surpass the capabilities of individual agents, primarily due to well-crafted inter-agent communication topologies. Despite the diverse and high-performing designs available, practitioners often face confusion when selecting the most effective pipeline for their specific task: \textit{Which topology is the best choice for my task, avoiding unnecessary communication token overhead while ensuring high-quality solution?} In response to this dilemma, we introduce G-Designer, an adaptive, efficient, and robust solution for multi-agent deployment, which dynamically designs task-aware, customized communication topologies. Specifically, G-Designer models the multi-agent system as a multi-agent network, leveraging a variational graph auto-encoder to encode both the nodes (agents) and a task-specific virtual node, and decodes a task-adaptive and high-performing communication topology. Extensive experiments on six benchmarks showcase that G-Designer is: \textbf{(1) high-performing}, achieving superior results on MMLU with accuracy at $84.50\%$ and on HumanEval with pass@1 at $89.90\%$; \textbf{(2) task-adaptive}, architecting communication protocols tailored to task difficulty, reducing token consumption by up to $95.33\%$ on HumanEval; and \textbf{(3) adversarially robust}, defending against agent adversarial attacks with merely $0.3\%$ accuracy drop.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond the Final Layer: Hierarchical Query Fusion Transformer with Agent-Interpolation Initialization for 3D Instance Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04139v1)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D instance segmentation aims to predict a set of object instances in a scene and represent them as binary foreground masks with corresponding semantic labels. Currently, transformer-based methods are gaining increasing attention due to their elegant pipelines, reduced manual selection of geometric properties, and superior performance. However, transformer-based methods fail to simultaneously maintain strong position and content information during query initialization. Additionally, due to supervision at each decoder layer, there exists a phenomenon of object disappearance with the deepening of layers. To overcome these hurdles, we introduce Beyond the Final Layer: Hierarchical Query Fusion Transformer with Agent-Interpolation Initialization for 3D Instance Segmentation (BFL). Specifically, an Agent-Interpolation Initialization Module is designed to generate resilient queries capable of achieving a balance between foreground coverage and content learning. Additionally, a Hierarchical Query Fusion Decoder is designed to retain low overlap queries, mitigating the decrease in recall with the deepening of layers. Extensive experiments on ScanNetV2, ScanNet200, ScanNet++ and S3DIS datasets demonstrate the superior performance of BFL.</p></details> | Under review |

Existing methods primarily utilize a paradigm of "greedy selection", i.e., selecting one document with the highest diversity score at a time or optimize an approximation of the objective function. These approaches tend to be inefficient and are easily trapped in a suboptimal state. To address these challenges, we introduce Multi-Agent reinforcement learning (MARL) for search result DIVersity, which called MA4DIV. In this approach, each document is an agent and the search result diversification is modeled as a cooperative task among multiple agents. By modeling the SRD ranking problem as a cooperative MARL problem, this approach allows for directly optimizing the diversity metrics, such as $\alpha$-NDCG, while achieving high training efficiency. We conducted experiments on public TREC datasets and a larger scale dataset in the industrial setting. The experiemnts show that MA4DIV achieves substantial improvements in both effectiveness and efficiency than existing baselines, especially on the industrial dataset. The code of MA4DIV can be seen on https://github.com/chenyiqun/MA4DIV.</p></details> |  |

Especially in real-world application domains, such as autonomous driving, auto-curriculum generation is considered vital for obtaining robust and general policies. However, crafting traffic scenarios with multiple, heterogeneous agents is typically considered as a tedious and time-consuming task, especially in more complex simulation environments. In our work, we introduce MATS-Gym, a Multi-Agent Traffic Scenario framework to train agents in CARLA, a high-fidelity driving simulator. MATS-Gym is a multi-agent training framework for autonomous driving that uses partial scenario specifications to generate traffic scenarios with variable numbers of agents. This paper unifies various existing approaches to traffic scenario description into a single training framework and demonstrates how it can be integrated with techniques from unsupervised environment design to automate the generation of adaptive auto-curricula.

| **[Simulating the Emergence of Differential Case Marking with Communicating Neural-Network Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04038v1)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differential Case Marking (DCM) refers to the phenomenon where grammatical case marking is applied selectively based on semantic, pragmatic, or other factors. The emergence of DCM has been studied in artificial language learning experiments with human participants, which were specifically aimed at disentangling the effects of learning from those of communication (Smith & Culbertson, 2020). Multi-agent reinforcement learning frameworks based on neural networks have gained significant interest to simulate the emergence of human-like linguistic phenomena. In this study, we employ such a framework in which agents first acquire an artificial language before engaging in communicative interactions, enabling direct comparisons to human result. Using a very generic communication optimization algorithm and neural-network learners that have no prior experience with language or semantic preferences, our results demonstrate that learning alone does not lead to DCM, but when agents communicate, differential use of markers arises. This supports Smith and Culbertson (2020)'s findings that highlight the critical role of communication in shaping DCM and showcases the potential of neural-agent models to complement experimental research on language evolution.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Meta Coordination Graphs for Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04028v1)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents deep meta coordination graphs (DMCG) for learning cooperative policies in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). Coordination graph formulations encode local interactions and accordingly factorize the joint value function of all agents to improve efficiency in MARL. However, existing approaches rely solely on pairwise relations between agents, which potentially oversimplifies complex multi-agent interactions. DMCG goes beyond these simple direct interactions by also capturing useful higher-order and indirect relationships among agents. It generates novel graph structures accommodating multiple types of interactions and arbitrary lengths of multi-hop connections in coordination graphs to model such interactions. It then employs a graph convolutional network module to learn powerful representations in an end-to-end manner. We demonstrate its effectiveness in multiple coordination problems in MARL where other state-of-the-art methods can suffer from sample inefficiency or fail entirely.

By streamlining the process of finding and combining knowledge, this approach reduces manual effort and enhances the learning experience.

| **[AgentGen: Enhancing Planning Abilities for Large Language Model based Agent via Environment and Task Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00764v3)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model-based agents have garnered significant attention and are becoming increasingly popular. Furthermore, planning ability is a crucial component of an LLM-based agent, which generally entails achieving a desired goal from an initial state. This paper investigates enhancing the planning abilities of LLMs through instruction tuning, referred to as agent training. Recent studies have demonstrated that utilizing expert-level trajectory for instruction-tuning LLMs effectively enhances their planning capabilities. However, existing work primarily focuses on synthesizing trajectories from manually designed planning tasks and environments. The labor-intensive nature of creating these environments and tasks impedes the generation of sufficiently varied and extensive trajectories. To address this limitation, this paper explores the automated synthesis of diverse environments and a gradual range of planning tasks, from easy to difficult. We introduce a framework, AgentGen, that leverages LLMs first to generate environments and subsequently generate planning tasks conditioned on these environments. Specifically, to improve environmental diversity, we propose using an inspiration corpus composed of various domain-specific text segments as the context for synthesizing environments. Moreover, to increase the difficulty diversity of generated planning tasks, we propose a bidirectional evolution method, Bi-Evol, that evolves planning tasks from easier and harder directions to synthesize a task set with a smoother difficulty curve. The evaluation results derived from AgentBoard show that AgentGen greatly improves LLMs' planning ability, e.g., the AgentGen instruction-tuned Llama-3.1-8B surpasses GPT-3.5 in overall performance. Moreover, the AgentGen-tuned Llama-3.1-70B model achieves state-of-the-art results in planning tasks.

| **[PAGNet: Pluggable Adaptive Generative Networks for Information Completion in Multi-Agent Communication](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03845v1)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For partially observable cooperative tasks, multi-agent systems must develop effective communication and understand the interplay among agents in order to achieve cooperative goals. However, existing multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) with communication methods lack evaluation metrics for information weights and information-level communication modeling. This causes agents to neglect the aggregation of multiple messages, thereby significantly reducing policy learning efficiency. In this paper, we propose pluggable adaptive generative networks (PAGNet), a novel framework that integrates generative models into MARL to enhance communication and decision-making. PAGNet enables agents to synthesize global states representations from weighted local observations and use these representations alongside learned communication weights for coordinated decision-making. This pluggable approach reduces the computational demands typically associated with the joint training of communication and policy networks. Extensive experimental evaluations across diverse benchmarks and communication scenarios demonstrate the significant performance improvements achieved by PAGNet. Furthermore, we analyze the emergent communication patterns and the quality of generated global states, providing insights into operational mechanisms.</p></details> | 14 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Self-Interested Agents in Collaborative Machine Learning: An Incentivized Adaptive Data-Centric Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06597v3)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a framework for adaptive data-centric collaborative machine learning among self-interested agents, coordinated by an arbiter. Designed to handle the incremental nature of real-world data, the framework operates in an online manner: at each time step, the arbiter collects a batch of data from agents, trains a machine learning model, and provides each agent with a distinct model reflecting its data contributions. This setup establishes a feedback loop where shared data influence model updates, and the resulting models guide future data-sharing policies. Agents evaluate and partition their data, selecting a partition to share using a stochastic parameterized policy, learned via policy gradient methods to optimize the utility of the received model as defined by agent-specific evaluation functions. On the arbiter side, the expected loss function over the true data distribution is optimized, incorporating agent-specific weights to account for distributional differences arising from diverse sources and selective sharing. A bilevel optimization algorithm jointly learns the model parameters and agent-specific weights. Mean-zero noise, computed using a distortion function that adjusts these agent-specific weights, is introduced to generate distinct agent-specific models, promoting valuable data sharing without requiring separate training. Our framework is underpinned by non-asymptotic analyses, ensuring convergence of the agent-side policy optimization to an approximate stationary point of the evaluation functions and convergence of the arbiter-side optimization to an approximate stationary point of the expected loss function.</p></details> |  |

We then propose PsyPlay, a dialogue generation framework that facilitates the expression of rich personalities among multiple LLM agents. Specifically, PsyPlay enables agents to assume roles with distinct personality traits and engage in discussions centered around specific topics, consistently exhibiting their designated personality traits throughout the interactions. Validation on generated dialogue data demonstrates that PsyPlay can accurately portray the intended personality traits, achieving an overall success rate of 80.31% on GPT-3.5. Notably, we observe that LLMs aligned with positive values are more successful in portraying positive personality roles compared to negative ones. Moreover, we construct a dialogue corpus for personality-infused role-playing, called PsyPlay-Bench. The corpus, which consists of 4745 instances of correctly portrayed dialogues using PsyPlay, aims to further facilitate research in personalized role-playing and dialogue personality detection.</p></details> |  |

This progress enables applications such as match outcome prediction, player scouting, and tactical analysis. In soccer, the effective utilization of event and tracking data is fundamental for capturing and analyzing the dynamics of the game. However, there are two primary challenges: the limited availability of event data, primarily restricted to top-tier teams and leagues, and the scarcity and high cost of tracking data, which complicates its integration with event data for comprehensive analysis. Here we propose OpenSTARLab, an open-source framework designed to democratize spatio-temporal agent data analysis in sports by addressing these key challenges. OpenSTARLab includes the Pre-processing Package that standardizes event and tracking data through Unified and Integrated Event Data and State-Action-Reward formats, the Event Modeling Package that implements deep learning-based event prediction, alongside the RLearn Package for reinforcement learning tasks. These technical components facilitate the handling of diverse data sources and support advanced analytical tasks, thereby enhancing the overall functionality and usability of the framework. To assess OpenSTARLab's effectiveness, we conducted several experimental evaluations. These demonstrate the superior performance of the specific event prediction model in terms of action and time prediction accuracies and maintained its robust event simulation performance. Furthermore, reinforcement learning experiments reveal a trade-off between action accuracy and temporal difference loss and show comprehensive visualization. Overall, OpenSTARLab serves as a robust platform for researchers and practitioners, enhancing innovation and collaboration in the field of soccer data analytics.</p></details> | <details><summary>OpenS...</summary><p>OpenSTARLab is available at https://github.com/open-starlab, and its documentation can be found at https://openstarlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/</p></details> |

The emergent reasoning ability in large language models offer a promising path for next-generation on-device AI agents. However, deploying full-scale Large Language Models (LLMs) on resource-limited local devices is challenging. In this paper, we propose Division-of-Thoughts (DoT), a collaborative reasoning framework leveraging the synergy between locally deployed Smaller-scale Language Models (SLMs) and cloud-based LLMs. DoT leverages a Task Decomposer to elicit the inherent planning abilities in language models to decompose user queries into smaller sub-tasks, which allows hybrid language models to fully exploit their respective strengths. Besides, DoT employs a Task Scheduler to analyze the pair-wise dependency of sub-tasks and create a dependency graph, facilitating parallel reasoning of sub-tasks and the identification of key steps. To allocate the appropriate model based on the difficulty of sub-tasks, DoT leverages a Plug-and-Play Adapter, which is an additional task head attached to the SLM that does not alter the SLM's parameters. To boost adapter's task allocation capability, we propose a self-reinforced training method that relies solely on task execution feedback. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate that our DoT significantly reduces LLM costs while maintaining competitive reasoning accuracy. Specifically, DoT reduces the average reasoning time and API costs by 66.12% and 83.57%, while achieving comparable reasoning accuracy with the best baseline methods.</p></details> |  |

Commonly-used approaches such as value decomposition often lead to suboptimal policies in these settings, and designing dense reward functions that align with human intuition can be complex and labor-intensive. In this work, we propose a novel framework where a large language model (LLM) generates dense, agent-specific rewards based on a natural language description of the task and the overall team goal. By learning a potential-based reward function over multiple queries, our method reduces the impact of ranking errors while allowing the LLM to evaluate each agent's contribution to the overall task. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our approach achieves faster convergence and higher policy returns compared to state-of-the-art MARL baselines.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |

However, the surge in AI systems' design and deployment driven by various stakeholders with distinct and unaligned objectives introduces a crucial challenge: how can uncoordinated AI systems coexist and evolve harmoniously in shared environments without creating chaos? To address this, we advocate for a fundamental rethinking of existing multi-agent frameworks, such as multi-agent systems and game theory, which are largely limited to predefined rules and static objective structures. We posit that AI agents should be empowered to dynamically adjust their objectives, make compromises, form coalitions, and safely compete or cooperate through evolving relationships and social feedback. Through this paper, we call for a shift toward the emergent, self-organizing, and context-aware nature of these systems.</p></details> |  |

One promising technique for ensuring the safety of MAS is distributed control barrier functions (CBF). However, it is difficult to design distributed CBF-based policies for MAS that can tackle unknown discrete-time dynamics, partial observability, changing neighborhoods, and input constraints, especially when a distributed high-performance nominal policy that can achieve the task is unavailable. To tackle these challenges, we propose DGPPO, a new framework that simultaneously learns both a discrete graph CBF which handles neighborhood changes and input constraints, and a distributed high-performance safe policy for MAS with unknown discrete-time dynamics. We empirically validate our claims on a suite of multi-agent tasks spanning three different simulation engines. The results suggest that, compared with existing methods, our DGPPO framework obtains policies that achieve high task performance (matching baselines that ignore the safety constraints), and high safety rates (matching the most conservative baselines), with a constant set of hyperparameters across all environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 15 figures, accepted by the thirteenth International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2025)</p></details> |

Agent-based modeling can be used for detailed studies of epidemic diffusion and possible interventions. Modeling of epidemic diffusion in large social contact networks requires the use of parallel algorithms and resources. In this work, we present Loimos, a scalable parallel framework for simulating epidemic diffusion. Loimos uses a hybrid of time-stepping and discrete-event simulation to model disease spread, and is implemented on top of an asynchronous, many-task runtime. We demonstrate that Loimos is to able to achieve significant speedups while scaling to large core counts. In particular, Loimos is able to simulate 200 days of a COVID-19 outbreak on a digital twin of California in about 42 seconds, for an average of 4.6 billion traversed edges per second (TEPS), using 4096 cores on Perlmutter at NERSC.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages (including references), 9 figures</p></details> |

Given any website, NNetNav produces these demonstrations by retroactively labeling action sequences from an exploration policy. Most work on training browser agents has relied on expensive human supervision, and the limited prior work on such interaction-based techniques has failed to provide effective search through the exponentially large space of exploration. In contrast, NNetNav exploits the hierarchical structure of language instructions to make this search more tractable: Complex instructions are typically decomposable into simpler sub-tasks, allowing NNetNav to automatically prune interaction episodes when an intermediate trajectory cannot be annotated with a meaningful sub-task. \texttt{LLama-3.1-8b} finetuned on 10k NNetNav self-generated demonstrations obtains over 16\% success rate on WebArena, and 35\% on WebVoyager, an improvement of 15pts and 31pts respectively over zero-shot \texttt{LLama-3.1-8b}, outperforming zero-shot GPT-4 and reaching the state-of-the-art among unsupervised methods, for both benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code,...</summary><p>Code, Data and Models available at https://www.nnetnav.dev</p></details> |

The Most Fire-Sensitive Point (MFSP) in a structure is the location where a fire would cause the greatest impact on structural stability. Accurate prediction of the MFSP is vital for streamlining structural assessments and optimizing the design process. This paper presents a novel framework for MFSP prediction using a neural network-based approach that integrates fire dynamics and finite element analysis through a differentiable agent model. The framework focuses on predicting the Maximum Interstory Drift Ratio (MIDR), a key indicator of structural performance under fire conditions. By leveraging the differentiable agent model, we efficiently generate labeled data for MFSP and directly train a predictor for this critical metric. To achieve this, we generated extensive simulation data encompassing structural and fire scenarios and employed graph neural networks to represent the building structures. Transfer learning was applied to optimize the training process, and an edge update mechanism was introduced to dynamically adjust edge attributes, reflecting property changes under fire conditions. The proposed model was rigorously evaluated on simulation data, demonstrating strong performance in accurately predicting both MIDR and MFSP, thus advancing fire safety analysis for building structures.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is currently under review at Computer-Aided Civil and Infrastructure Engineering</p></details> |

This rise in energy demand poses significant challenges to resource availability and raises sustainability concerns for large-scale IoT deployments. Efficient energy utilization in communication networks, particularly for power-constrained IoT devices, has thus become a critical area of research. In this paper, we deployed flying LoRa gateways (GWs) mounted on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to collect data from LoRa end devices (EDs) and transmit it to a central server. Our primary objective is to maximize the global system energy efficiency (EE) of wireless LoRa networks by joint optimization of transmission power (TP), spreading factor (SF), bandwidth (W), and ED association. To solve this challenging problem, we model the problem as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), where each flying LoRa GW acts as a learning agent using a cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) approach under centralized training and decentralized execution (CTDE). Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed method, based on the multi-agent proximal policy optimization (MAPPO) algorithm, significantly improves the global system EE and surpasses the conventional MARL schemes.</p></details> | 6 pages, 6 figures |

OM systems currently have two prevailing design paradigms: conventional knowledge-based expert systems and newer machine learning-based predictive systems. While large language models (LLMs) and LLM agents have revolutionised data engineering and have been applied creatively in many domains, their potential for OM remains underexplored. This study introduces a novel agent-powered LLM-based design paradigm for OM systems. With consideration of several specific challenges in leveraging LLM agents for OM, we propose a generic framework, namely Agent-OM (Agent for Ontology Matching), consisting of two Siamese agents for retrieval and matching, with a set of OM tools. Our framework is implemented in a proof-of-concept system. Evaluations of three Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI) tracks over state-of-the-art OM systems show that our system can achieve results very close to the long-standing best performance on simple OM tasks and can significantly improve the performance on complex and few-shot OM tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 12 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[SymAgent: A Neural-Symbolic Self-Learning Agent Framework for Complex Reasoning over Knowledge Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03283v1)** | 2025-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements have highlighted that Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to hallucinations when solving complex reasoning problems, leading to erroneous results. To tackle this issue, researchers incorporate Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to improve the reasoning ability of LLMs. However, existing methods face two limitations: 1) they typically assume that all answers to the questions are contained in KGs, neglecting the incompleteness issue of KGs, and 2) they treat the KG as a static repository and overlook the implicit logical reasoning structures inherent in KGs. In this paper, we introduce SymAgent, an innovative neural-symbolic agent framework that achieves collaborative augmentation between KGs and LLMs. We conceptualize KGs as dynamic environments and transform complex reasoning tasks into a multi-step interactive process, enabling KGs to participate deeply in the reasoning process. SymAgent consists of two modules: Agent-Planner and Agent-Executor. The Agent-Planner leverages LLM's inductive reasoning capability to extract symbolic rules from KGs, guiding efficient question decomposition. The Agent-Executor autonomously invokes predefined action tools to integrate information from KGs and external documents, addressing the issues of KG incompleteness. Furthermore, we design a self-learning framework comprising online exploration and offline iterative policy updating phases, enabling the agent to automatically synthesize reasoning trajectories and improve performance. Experimental results demonstrate that SymAgent with weak LLM backbones (i.e., 7B series) yields better or comparable performance compared to various strong baselines. Further analysis reveals that our agent can identify missing triples, facilitating automatic KG updates.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Agent Path Finding under Limited Communication Range Constraint via Dynamic Leading](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02770v2)** | 2025-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a novel framework to handle a multi-agent path finding problem under a limited communication range constraint, where all agents must have a connected communication channel to the rest of the team. Many existing approaches to multi-agent path finding (e.g., leader-follower platooning) overcome computational challenges of planning in this domain by planning one agent at a time in a fixed order. However, fixed leader-follower approaches can become stuck during planning, limiting their practical utility in dense-clutter environments. To overcome this limitation, we develop dynamic leading multi-agent path finding, which allows for dynamic reselection of the leading agent during path planning whenever progress cannot be made. The experiments show the efficiency of our framework, which can handle up to 25 agents with more than 90% success-rate across five environment types where baselines routinely fail.</p></details> |  |

The key technique is the motion field agent that converts motion information in text prompts into explicit motion fields, providing flexible and precise motion guidance. Specifically, the agent extracts the object movement and camera motion described in the text and converts them into object trajectories and camera extrinsics, respectively. An analytical optical flow composition module integrates these motion representations in 3D space and projects them into a unified optical flow. An optical flow adapter takes the flow to control the base image-to-video diffusion model for generating fine-grained controlled videos. The significant improvement in the Video-Text Camera Motion metrics on VBench indicates that our method achieves precise control over camera motion. We construct a subset of VBench to evaluate the alignment of motion information in the text and the generated video, outperforming other advanced models on motion generation accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Elucidation of the Concept of Consciousness from the Theory of Non-Human Communication Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03508v1)** | 2025-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This article focuses on elucidating the concept of consciousness from a relational and post-phenomenological theory of non-human communication agents (ANHC). Specifically, we explore the contributions of Thomas Metzinger s Self Model Theory, Katherine Hayles conceptualizations of non-conscious cognitive processes centered on knowledge processing phenomena shared between biological and technical systems and Lenore and Manuel Blum s theoretical perspective on computation, which defines consciousness as an emergent phenomenon of complex computational systems, arising from the appropriate organization of their inorganic materiality. Building on interactions with non-human cognitive agents, among other factors, the explainability of sociotechnical systems challenges the humanistic common sense of modern philosophy and science. This critical integration of various approaches ultimately questions other concepts associated with consciousness, such as autonomy, freedom, and mutual responsibility. The aim is to contribute to a necessary discussion for designing new frameworks of understanding that pave the way toward an ethical and pragmatic approach to addressing contemporary challenges in the design, regulation, and interaction with ANHC. Such frameworks, in turn, enable a more inclusive and relational understanding of agency in an interconnected world.</p></details> | <details><summary>Versi...</summary><p>Version febrero 2025, originalmente escrito en diciembre de 2024</p></details> |
| **[Double Distillation Network for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03125v1)** | 2025-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent reinforcement learning typically employs a centralized training-decentralized execution (CTDE) framework to alleviate the non-stationarity in environment. However, the partial observability during execution may lead to cumulative gap errors gathered by agents, impairing the training of effective collaborative policies. To overcome this challenge, we introduce the Double Distillation Network (DDN), which incorporates two distillation modules aimed at enhancing robust coordination and facilitating the collaboration process under constrained information. The external distillation module uses a global guiding network and a local policy network, employing distillation to reconcile the gap between global training and local execution. In addition, the internal distillation module introduces intrinsic rewards, drawn from state information, to enhance the exploration capabilities of agents. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DDN significantly improves performance across multiple scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimistic ε-Greedy Exploration for Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03506v1)** | 2025-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE) paradigm is widely used in cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning. However, due to the representational limitations of traditional monotonic value decomposition methods, algorithms can underestimate optimal actions, leading policies to suboptimal solutions. To address this challenge, we propose Optimistic $\epsilon$-Greedy Exploration, focusing on enhancing exploration to correct value estimations. The underestimation arises from insufficient sampling of optimal actions during exploration, as our analysis indicated. We introduce an optimistic updating network to identify optimal actions and sample actions from its distribution with a probability of $\epsilon$ during exploration, increasing the selection frequency of optimal actions. Experimental results in various environments reveal that the Optimistic $\epsilon$-Greedy Exploration effectively prevents the algorithm from suboptimal solutions and significantly improves its performance compared to other algorithms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revealing the Learning Process in Reinforcement Learning Agents Through Attention-Oriented Metrics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14324v2)** | 2025-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The learning process of a reinforcement learning (RL) agent remains poorly understood beyond the mathematical formulation of its learning algorithm. To address this gap, we introduce attention-oriented metrics (ATOMs) to investigate the development of an RL agent's attention during training. In a controlled experiment, we tested ATOMs on three variations of a Pong game, each designed to teach the agent distinct behaviours, complemented by a behavioural assessment. ATOMs successfully delineate the attention patterns of an agent trained on each game variation, and that these differences in attention patterns translate into differences in the agent's behaviour. Through continuous monitoring of ATOMs during training, we observed that the agent's attention developed in phases, and that these phases were consistent across game variations. Overall, we believe that ATOM could help improve our understanding of the learning processes of RL agents and better understand the relationship between attention and learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Works...</summary><p>Workshop on Scientific Methods for Understanding Deep Learning, NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

Despite advancements in learning-based methods, existing approaches often face critical limitations, including suboptimal agent coordination, poor generalizability, and high computational latency. To address these issues, we propose Parallel AutoRegressive Combinatorial Optimization (PARCO), a reinforcement learning framework designed to construct high-quality solutions for multi-agent combinatorial tasks efficiently. To this end, PARCO integrates three key components: (1) transformer-based communication layers to enable effective agent collaboration during parallel solution construction, (2) a multiple pointer mechanism for low-latency, parallel agent decision-making, and (3) priority-based conflict handlers to resolve decision conflicts via learned priorities. We evaluate PARCO in multi-agent vehicle routing and scheduling problems where our approach outperforms state-of-the-art learning methods and demonstrates strong generalization ability and remarkable computational efficiency.

| **[FedMobileAgent: Training Mobile Agents Using Decentralized Self-Sourced Data from Diverse Users](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02982v1)** | 2025-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advancement of mobile agents has opened new opportunities for automating tasks on mobile devices. Training these agents requires large-scale high-quality data, which is costly using human labor. Given the vast number of mobile phone users worldwide, if automated data collection from them is feasible, the resulting data volume and the subsequently trained mobile agents could reach unprecedented levels. Nevertheless, two major challenges arise: (1) extracting high-level and low-level user instructions without involving human and (2) utilizing distributed data from diverse users while preserving privacy. To tackle these challenges, we propose FedMobileAgent, a collaborative framework that trains mobile agents using self-sourced data from diverse users. Specifically, it includes two techniques. First, we propose Auto-Annotation, which enables the automatic collection of high-quality datasets during users' routine phone usage with minimal cost. Second, we introduce adapted aggregation to improve federated training of mobile agents on non-IID user data, by incorporating both episode- and step-level distributions. In distributed settings, FedMobileAgent achieves performance comparable to centralized human-annotated models at less than 0.02\% of the cost, highlighting its potential for real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[ReachAgent: Enhancing Mobile Agent via Page Reaching and Operation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02955v1)** | 2025-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, mobile AI agents have gained increasing attention. Given a task, mobile AI agents can interact with mobile devices in multiple steps and finally form a GUI flow that solves the task. However, existing agents tend to focus on most task-relevant elements at each step, leading to local optimal solutions and ignoring the overall GUI flow. To address this issue, we constructed a training dataset called MobileReach, which breaks the task into page reaching and operation subtasks. Furthermore, we propose ReachAgent, a two-stage framework that focuses on improving its task-completion abilities. It utilizes the page reaching and page operation subtasks, along with reward-based preference GUI flows, to further enhance the agent. Experimental results show that ReachAgent significantly improves the IoU Acc and Text Acc by 7.12% and 7.69% on the step-level and 4.72% and 4.63% on the task-level compared to the SOTA agent. Our data and code will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |

While there is a growing trend of humans helping AI agents, it remains unclear whether the well-being benefits of helping others extend to interactions with non-human entities. To address this, we conducted an experiment (N = 295) to explore how helping AI agents impacts human well-being, especially when the agents fulfill human basic psychological needs--relatedness, competence, and autonomy--during the interaction. Our findings showed that helping AI agents reduced participants' feelings of loneliness. When AI met participants' needs for competence and autonomy during the helping process, there was a further decrease in loneliness and an increase in positive affect. However, when AI did not meet participants' need for relatedness, participants experienced an increase in positive affect. We discuss the implications of these findings for understanding how AI can support human well-being.</p></details> |  |
| **[Heterogeneous Value Decomposition Policy Fusion for Multi-Agent Cooperation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02875v1)** | 2025-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Value decomposition (VD) has become one of the most prominent solutions in cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning. Most existing methods generally explore how to factorize the joint value and minimize the discrepancies between agent observations and characteristics of environmental states. However, direct decomposition may result in limited representation or difficulty in optimization. Orthogonal to designing a new factorization scheme, in this paper, we propose Heterogeneous Policy Fusion (HPF) to integrate the strengths of various VD methods. We construct a composite policy set to select policies for interaction adaptively. Specifically, this adaptive mechanism allows agents' trajectories to benefit from diverse policy transitions while incorporating the advantages of each factorization method. Additionally, HPF introduces a constraint between these heterogeneous policies to rectify the misleading update caused by the unexpected exploratory or suboptimal non-cooperation. Experimental results on cooperative tasks show HPF's superior performance over multiple baselines, proving its effectiveness and ease of implementation.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents OceanChat, an interactive system leveraging large language models to create conversational AI agents represented as animated marine creatures -- specifically a beluga whale, a jellyfish, and a seahorse -- designed to promote environmental behavior (PEB) and foster awareness through personalized dialogue. Through a between-subjects experiment (N=900), we compared three conditions: (1) Static Scientific Information, providing conventional environmental education through text and images; (2) Static Character Narrative, featuring first-person storytelling from 3D-rendered marine creatures; and (3) Conversational Character Narrative, enabling real-time dialogue with AI-powered marine characters. Our analysis revealed that the Conversational Character Narrative condition significantly increased behavioral intentions and sustainable choice preferences compared to static approaches. The beluga whale character demonstrated consistently stronger emotional engagement across multiple measures, including perceived anthropomorphism and empathy. However, impacts on deeper measures like climate policy support and psychological distance were limited, highlighting the complexity of shifting entrenched beliefs. Our work extends research on sustainability interfaces facilitating PEB and offers design principles for creating emotionally resonant, context-aware AI characters. By balancing anthropomorphism with species authenticity, OceanChat demonstrates how interactive narratives can bridge the gap between environmental knowledge and real-world behavior change.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 18 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

To address this limitation, we propose the Wolfpack Adversarial Attack framework, inspired by wolf hunting strategies, which targets an initial agent and its assisting agents to disrupt cooperation. Additionally, we introduce the Wolfpack-Adversarial Learning for MARL (WALL) framework, which trains robust MARL policies to defend against the proposed Wolfpack attack by fostering system-wide collaboration. Experimental results underscore the devastating impact of the Wolfpack attack and the significant robustness improvements achieved by WALL.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages main, 21 pages appendix with reference.

This paper introduces CAMI, a novel automated counselor agent grounded in Motivational Interviewing (MI) -- a client-centered counseling approach designed to address ambivalence and facilitate behavior change. CAMI employs a novel STAR framework, consisting of client's state inference, motivation topic exploration, and response generation modules, leveraging large language models (LLMs). These components work together to evoke change talk, aligning with MI principles and improving counseling outcomes for clients from diverse backgrounds. We evaluate CAMI's performance through both automated and manual evaluations, utilizing simulated clients to assess MI skill competency, client's state inference accuracy, topic exploration proficiency, and overall counseling success. Results show that CAMI not only outperforms several state-of-the-art methods but also shows more realistic counselor-like behavior. Additionally, our ablation study underscores the critical roles of state inference and topic exploration in achieving this performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[PatchPilot: A Stable and Cost-Efficient Agentic Patching Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02747v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent research builds various patching agents that combine large language models (LLMs) with non-ML tools and achieve promising results on the state-of-the-art (SOTA) software patching benchmark, SWE-Bench. Based on how to determine the patching workflows, existing patching agents can be categorized as agent-based planning methods, which rely on LLMs for planning, and human-based planning methods, which follow a pre-defined workflow. At a high level, agent-based planning methods achieve high patching performance but with a high cost and limited stability. Human-based planning methods, on the other hand, are more stable and efficient but have key workflow limitations that compromise their patching performance. In this paper, we propose PatchPilot, an agentic patcher that strikes a balance between patching efficacy, stability, and cost-efficiency. PatchPilot proposes a novel human-based planning workflow with five components: reproduction, localization, generation, validation, and refinement (where refinement is unique to PatchPilot). We introduce novel and customized designs to each component to optimize their effectiveness and efficiency. Through extensive experiments on the SWE-Bench benchmarks, PatchPilot shows a superior performance than existing open-source methods while maintaining low cost (less than 1$ per instance) and ensuring higher stability. We also conduct a detailed ablation study to validate the key designs in each component.</p></details> |  |

With large language models (LLMs) crossing critical reliability thresholds for a growing slate of capabilities, there is an increasing effort to decompose systems into sets of LLM-based agents, each of whom can be delegated sub-tasks. However, this decomposition (even when automated) is often intuitive, e.g., based on how a human might assign roles to members of a human team. How close are these role decompositions to optimal? This position paper argues that asymptotic analysis with LLM primitives is needed to reason about the efficiency of such decomposed systems, and that insights from such analysis will unlock opportunities for scaling them. By treating the LLM forward pass as the atomic unit of computational cost, one can separate out the (often opaque) inner workings of a particular LLM from the inherent efficiency of how a set of LLMs are orchestrated to solve hard problems. In other words, if we want to scale the deployment of LLMs to the limit, instead of anthropomorphizing LLMs, asymptotic analysis with LLM primitives should be used to reason about and develop more powerful decompositions of large problems into LLM agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages including references</p></details> |
| **[Dissecting Adversarial Robustness of Multimodal LM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12814v3)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As language models (LMs) are used to build autonomous agents in real environments, ensuring their adversarial robustness becomes a critical challenge. Unlike chatbots, agents are compound systems with multiple components taking actions, which existing LMs safety evaluations do not adequately address. To bridge this gap, we manually create 200 targeted adversarial tasks and evaluation scripts in a realistic threat model on top of VisualWebArena, a real environment for web agents. To systematically examine the robustness of agents, we propose the Agent Robustness Evaluation (ARE) framework. ARE views the agent as a graph showing the flow of intermediate outputs between components and decomposes robustness as the flow of adversarial information on the graph. We find that we can successfully break latest agents that use black-box frontier LMs, including those that perform reflection and tree search. With imperceptible perturbations to a single image (less than 5% of total web page pixels), an attacker can hijack these agents to execute targeted adversarial goals with success rates up to 67%. We also use ARE to rigorously evaluate how the robustness changes as new components are added. We find that inference-time compute that typically improves benign performance can open up new vulnerabilities and harm robustness. An attacker can compromise the evaluator used by the reflexion agent and the value function of the tree search agent, which increases the attack success relatively by 15% and 20%.

One of the key ingredients to the success of language agents is the reward model on the trajectory of the agentic workflow, which provides valuable guidance during training or inference. However, due to the lack of annotations of intermediate interactions, most existing works use an outcome reward model to optimize policies across entire trajectories. This may lead to sub-optimal policies and hinder the overall performance. To address this, we propose QLASS (Q-guided Language Agent Stepwise Search), to automatically generate annotations by estimating Q-values in a stepwise manner for open language agents. By introducing a reasoning tree and performing process reward modeling, QLASS provides effective intermediate guidance for each step. With the stepwise guidance, we propose a Q-guided generation strategy to enable language agents to better adapt to long-term value, resulting in significant performance improvement during model inference on complex interactive agent tasks. Notably, even with almost half the annotated data, QLASS retains strong performance, demonstrating its efficiency in handling limited supervision. We also empirically demonstrate that QLASS can lead to more effective decision making through qualitative analysis. We will release our code and data.</p></details> |  |

However, writing these high-performance ML libraries is challenging because it requires expert knowledge of ML algorithms and the ASPL. Large language models (LLMs), on the other hand, have shown general coding capabilities. However, challenges remain when using LLMs for generating ML libraries using ASPLs because 1) this task is complicated even for experienced human programmers and 2) there are limited code examples because of the esoteric and evolving nature of ASPLs. Therefore, LLMs need complex reasoning with limited data in order to complete this task. To address these challenges, we introduce an adaptive self-improvement agentic system. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of our system, we construct a benchmark of a typical ML library and generate ASPL code with both open and closed-source LLMs on this benchmark. Our results show improvements of up to $3.9\times$ over a baseline single LLM.</p></details> |  |

The agents are programmed with prompts that declare their functionality, along with the topologies that orchestrate interactions across agents. Designing prompts and topologies for multi-agent systems (MAS) is inherently complex. To automate the entire design process, we first conduct an in-depth analysis of the design space aiming to understand the factors behind building effective MAS. We reveal that prompts together with topologies play critical roles in enabling more effective MAS design. Based on the insights, we propose Multi-Agent System Search (MASS), a MAS optimization framework that efficiently exploits the complex MAS design space by interleaving its optimization stages, from local to global, from prompts to topologies, over three stages: 1) block-level (local) prompt optimization; 2) workflow topology optimization; 3) workflow-level (global) prompt optimization, where each stage is conditioned on the iteratively optimized prompts/topologies from former stages. We show that MASS-optimized multi-agent systems outperform a spectrum of existing alternatives by a substantial margin. Based on the MASS-found systems, we finally propose design principles behind building effective multi-agent systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 7 figures, 1 table (30 pages, 9 figures, 5 tables including references and appendices)</p></details> |

Decentralized FL (DFL) utilizes local model exchange and aggregation between agents to reduce the communication and computation overheads on the central server. However, when agents are mobile, the communication opportunity between agents can be sporadic, largely hindering the convergence and accuracy of DFL. In this paper, we propose Cached Decentralized Federated Learning (Cached-DFL) to investigate delay-tolerant model spreading and aggregation enabled by model caching on mobile agents. Each agent stores not only its own model, but also models of agents encountered in the recent past. When two agents meet, they exchange their own models as well as the cached models. Local model aggregation utilizes all models stored in the cache. We theoretically analyze the convergence of Cached-DFL, explicitly taking into account the model staleness introduced by caching. We design and compare different model caching algorithms for different DFL and mobility scenarios. We conduct detailed case studies in a vehicular network to systematically investigate the interplay between agent mobility, cache staleness, and model convergence. In our experiments, Cached-DFL converges quickly, and significantly outperforms DFL without caching.</p></details> | <details><summary>Oral ...</summary><p>Oral Presentation at AAAI 2025</p></details> |

While IDAs powered by instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) can react to feedback from interface invocations in multi-step exchanges, they have not been trained in their respective digital environments. Prior methods accomplish less than half of tasks in sophisticated benchmarks such as AppWorld. We present a reinforcement learning (RL) approach that trains IDAs directly in their target environments. We formalize this training as a partially observable Markov decision process and derive LOOP, a data- and memory-efficient variant of proximal policy optimization. LOOP uses no value network and maintains exactly one copy of the underlying LLM in memory, making its implementation straightforward and as memory-efficient as fine-tuning a single LLM. A 32-billion-parameter agent trained with LOOP in the AppWorld environment outperforms the much larger OpenAI o1 agent by 9 percentage points (15% relative). To our knowledge, this is the first reported application of RL to IDAs that interact with a stateful, multi-domain, multi-app environment via direct API calls. Our analysis sheds light on the effectiveness of RL in this area, showing that the agent learns to consult the API documentation, avoid unwarranted assumptions, minimize confabulation, and recover from setbacks.</p></details> |  |

We introduce a novel framework that integrates graph neural networks (GNNs) with a centralized training and decentralized execution (CTDE) paradigm, further enhanced by a tailored Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm for multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MARL). Our approach enables unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) to dynamically allocate tasks efficiently without necessitating central coordination in a 3D grid environment. The framework minimizes total travel time while simultaneously avoiding conflicts in task assignments. For the cost calculation and routing, we employ reservation-based A* and R* path planners. Experimental results revealed that our method achieves a high 92.5% conflict-free success rate, with only a 7.49% performance gap compared to the centralized Hungarian method, while outperforming the heuristic decentralized baseline based on greedy approach. Additionally, the framework exhibits scalability with up to 20 agents with allocation processing of 2.8 s and robustness in responding to dynamically generated tasks, underscoring its potential for real-world applications in complex multi-agent scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Intelligent Vehicle Symposium (2025)</p></details> |
| **[Interactive Tools Substantially Assist LM Agents in Finding Security Vulnerabilities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16165v2)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although language model (LM) agents have demonstrated increased performance in multiple domains, including coding and web-browsing, their success in cybersecurity has been limited. We present EnIGMA, an LM agent for autonomously solving Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges. We introduce new tools and interfaces to improve the agent's ability to find and exploit security vulnerabilities, focusing on interactive terminal programs. These novel Interactive Agent Tools enable LM agents, for the first time, to run interactive utilities, such as a debugger and a server connection tool, which are essential for solving these challenges. Empirical analysis on 390 CTF challenges across four benchmarks demonstrate that these new tools and interfaces substantially improve our agent's performance, achieving state-of-the-art results on NYU CTF, Intercode-CTF, and CyBench. Finally, we analyze data leakage, developing new methods to quantify it and identifying a new phenomenon we term soliloquizing, where the model self-generates hallucinated observations without interacting with the environment. Our code and development dataset are available at https://github.com/SWE-agent/SWE-agent/tree/v0.7 and https://github.com/NYU-LLM-CTF/NYU_CTF_Bench/tree/main/development respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sequential Multi-objective Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning Approach for Predictive Maintenance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02071v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing predictive maintenance (PdM) methods typically focus solely on whether to replace system components without considering the costs incurred by inspection. However, a well-considered approach should be able to minimize Remaining Useful Life (RUL) at engine replacement while maximizing inspection interval. To achieve this, multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) can be introduced. However, due to the sequential and mutually constraining nature of these 2 objectives, conventional MARL is not applicable. Therefore, this paper introduces a novel framework and develops a Sequential Multi-objective Multi-agent Proximal Policy Optimization (SMOMA-PPO) algorithm. Furthermore, to provide comprehensive and effective degradation information to RL agents, we also employed Gated Recurrent Unit, quantile regression, and probability distribution fitting to develop a GRU-based RUL Prediction (GRP) model. Experiments demonstrate that the GRP method significantly improves the accuracy of RUL predictions in the later stages of system operation compared to existing methods. When incorporating its output into SMOMA-PPO, we achieve at least a 15% reduction in average RUL without unscheduled replacements (UR), nearly a 10% increase in inspection interval, and an overall decrease in maintenance costs. Importantly, our approach offers a new perspective for addressing multi-objective maintenance planning with sequential constraints, effectively enhancing system reliability and reducing maintenance expenses.</p></details> |  |
| **[MASTER: A Multi-Agent System with LLM Specialized MCTS](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14304v2)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLM) are increasingly being explored for problem-solving tasks. However, their strategic planning capability is often viewed with skepticism. Recent studies have incorporated the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm to augment the planning capacity of LLM. Despite its potential, MCTS relies on extensive sampling simulations to approximate the true reward distribution, which leads to two primary issues. Firstly, MCTS is effective for tasks like the Game of Go, where simulation results can yield objective rewards (e.g., 1 for a win and 0 for a loss). However, for tasks such as question answering, the result of a simulation is the answer to the question, which cannot yield an objective reward without the ground truth. Secondly, obtaining statistically significant reward estimations typically requires a sample size exceeding 30 simulations, resulting in excessive token usage and time consumption. To address these challenges, we present the Multi-Agent System with Tactical Execution and Reasoning using LLM Specialized MCTS (MASTER), a novel framework that coordinates agent recruitment and communication through LLM specialized MCTS. This system autonomously adjusts the number of agents based on task complexity and ensures focused communication among them. Comprehensive experiments across various tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework. It achieves 76% accuracy on HotpotQA and 80% on WebShop, setting new state-of-the-art performance on these datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by main NAACL 2025</p></details> |
| **[Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation: A Survey on Agentic RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09136v3)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized artificial intelligence (AI) by enabling human like text generation and natural language understanding. However, their reliance on static training data limits their ability to respond to dynamic, real time queries, resulting in outdated or inaccurate outputs. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a solution, enhancing LLMs by integrating real time data retrieval to provide contextually relevant and up-to-date responses. Despite its promise, traditional RAG systems are constrained by static workflows and lack the adaptability required for multistep reasoning and complex task management. Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Agentic RAG) transcends these limitations by embedding autonomous AI agents into the RAG pipeline. These agents leverage agentic design patterns reflection, planning, tool use, and multiagent collaboration to dynamically manage retrieval strategies, iteratively refine contextual understanding, and adapt workflows to meet complex task requirements. This integration enables Agentic RAG systems to deliver unparalleled flexibility, scalability, and context awareness across diverse applications. This survey provides a comprehensive exploration of Agentic RAG, beginning with its foundational principles and the evolution of RAG paradigms. It presents a detailed taxonomy of Agentic RAG architectures, highlights key applications in industries such as healthcare, finance, and education, and examines practical implementation strategies. Additionally, it addresses challenges in scaling these systems, ensuring ethical decision making, and optimizing performance for real-world applications, while providing detailed insights into frameworks and tools for implementing Agentic RAG.</p></details> |  |
| **[A continuous-time violation-free multi-agent optimization algorithm and its applications to safe distributed control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07571v2)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we propose a continuous-time distributed optimization algorithm with guaranteed zero coupling constraint violation and apply it to safe distributed control in the presence of multiple control barrier functions (CBF). The optimization problem is defined over a network that collectively minimizes a separable cost function with coupled linear constraints. An equivalent optimization problem with auxiliary decision variables and a decoupling structure is proposed. A sensitivity analysis demonstrates that the subgradient information can be computed using local information. This then leads to a subgradient algorithm for updating the auxiliary variables. A case with sparse coupling constraints is further considered, and it is shown to have better memory and communication efficiency. For the specific case of a CBF-induced time-varying quadratic program (QP), an update law is proposed that achieves finite-time convergence. Numerical results involving a static resource allocation problem and a safe coordination problem for a multi-agent system demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed algorithms.</p></details> | Accepted by IEEE TAC |
| **[Bottom-Up Reputation Promotes Cooperation with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01971v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reputation serves as a powerful mechanism for promoting cooperation in multi-agent systems, as agents are more inclined to cooperate with those of good social standing. While existing multi-agent reinforcement learning methods typically rely on predefined social norms to assign reputations, the question of how a population reaches a consensus on judgement when agents hold private, independent views remains unresolved. In this paper, we propose a novel bottom-up reputation learning method, Learning with Reputation Reward (LR2), designed to promote cooperative behaviour through rewards shaping based on assigned reputation. Our agent architecture includes a dilemma policy that determines cooperation by considering the impact on neighbours, and an evaluation policy that assigns reputations to affect the actions of neighbours while optimizing self-objectives. It operates using local observations and interaction-based rewards, without relying on centralized modules or predefined norms. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness and adaptability of LR2 across various spatial social dilemma scenarios. Interestingly, we find that LR2 stabilizes and enhances cooperation not only with reward reshaping from bottom-up reputation but also by fostering strategy clustering in structured populations, thereby creating environments conducive to sustained cooperation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAMAS 2025 (24th International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems)</p></details> |
| **[DHP: Discrete Hierarchical Planning for Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01956v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we address the challenge of long-horizon visual planning tasks using Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL). Our key contribution is a Discrete Hierarchical Planning (DHP) method, an alternative to traditional distance-based approaches. We provide theoretical foundations for the method and demonstrate its effectiveness through extensive empirical evaluations. Our agent recursively predicts subgoals in the context of a long-term goal and receives discrete rewards for constructing plans as compositions of abstract actions. The method introduces a novel advantage estimation strategy for tree trajectories, which inherently encourages shorter plans and enables generalization beyond the maximum tree depth. The learned policy function allows the agent to plan efficiently, requiring only $\log N$ computational steps, making re-planning highly efficient. The agent, based on a soft-actor critic (SAC) framework, is trained using on-policy imagination data. Additionally, we propose a novel exploration strategy that enables the agent to generate relevant training examples for the planning modules. We evaluate our method on long-horizon visual planning tasks in a 25-room environment, where it significantly outperforms previous benchmarks at success rate and average episode length. Furthermore, an ablation study highlights the individual contributions of key modules to the overall performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[VideoWebArena: Evaluating Long Context Multimodal Agents with Video Understanding Web Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19100v2)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Videos are often used to learn or extract the necessary information to complete tasks in ways different than what text and static imagery alone can provide. However, many existing agent benchmarks neglect long-context video understanding, instead focusing on text or static image inputs. To bridge this gap, we introduce VideoWebArena (VideoWA), a benchmark for evaluating the capabilities of long-context multimodal agents for video understanding. VideoWA consists of 2,021 web agent tasks based on manually crafted video tutorials, which total almost four hours of content. For our benchmark, we define a taxonomy of long-context video-based agent tasks with two main areas of focus: skill retention and factual retention. While skill retention tasks evaluate whether an agent can use a given human demonstration to complete a task efficiently, the factual retention task evaluates whether an agent can retrieve instruction-relevant information from a video to complete a task. We find that the best model achieves 13.3% success on factual retention tasks and 45.8% on factual retention QA pairs, far below human performance at 73.9% and 79.3%, respectively. On skill retention tasks, long-context models perform worse with tutorials than without, exhibiting a 5% performance decrease in WebArena tasks and a 10.3% decrease in VisualWebArena tasks. Our work highlights the need to improve the agentic abilities of long-context multimodal models and provides a testbed for future development with long-context video agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[Firewalls to Secure Dynamic LLM Agentic Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01822v1)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Future LLM agents are likely to communicate on behalf of users with other entity-representing agents on tasks that entail long-horizon plans with interdependent goals. Current work does not focus on such agentic networks, nor does it address their challenges. Thus, we first identify the required properties of agents' communication, which should be proactive and adaptable. It needs to satisfy 1) privacy: agents should not share more than what is needed for the task, and 2) security: the communication must preserve integrity and maintain utility against selfish entities. We design a use case (travel planning) as a testbed that exemplifies these requirements, and we show examples of how this can go wrong. Next, we propose a practical design, inspired by established network security principles, for constrained LLM agentic networks that balance adaptability, security, and privacy. Our framework automatically constructs and updates task-specific rules from prior simulations to build firewalls. We offer layers of defense to 1) convert free-form input to a task-specific protocol, 2) dynamically abstract users' data to a task-specific degree of permissiveness, and 3) self-correct the agents' trajectory.</p></details> |  |
| **[Agentic Bug Reproduction for Effective Automated Program Repair at Google](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01821v1)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bug reports often lack sufficient detail for developers to reproduce and fix the underlying defects. Bug Reproduction Tests (BRTs), tests that fail when the bug is present and pass when it has been resolved, are crucial for debugging, but they are rarely included in bug reports, both in open-source and in industrial settings. Thus, automatically generating BRTs from bug reports has the potential to accelerate the debugging process and lower time to repair. This paper investigates automated BRT generation within an industry setting, specifically at Google, focusing on the challenges of a large-scale, proprietary codebase and considering real-world industry bugs extracted from Google's internal issue tracker. We adapt and evaluate a state-of-the-art BRT generation technique, LIBRO, and present our agent-based approach, BRT Agent, which makes use of a fine-tuned Large Language Model (LLM) for code editing. Our BRT Agent significantly outperforms LIBRO, achieving a 28% plausible BRT generation rate, compared to 10% by LIBRO, on 80 human-reported bugs from Google's internal issue tracker. We further investigate the practical value of generated BRTs by integrating them with an Automated Program Repair (APR) system at Google. Our results show that providing BRTs to the APR system results in 30% more bugs with plausible fixes. Additionally, we introduce Ensemble Pass Rate (EPR), a metric which leverages the generated BRTs to select the most promising fixes from all fixes generated by APR system. Our evaluation on EPR for Top-K and threshold-based fix selections demonstrates promising results and trade-offs. For example, EPR correctly selects a plausible fix from a pool of 20 candidates in 70% of cases, based on its top-1 ranking.</p></details> |  |

This study developed and validated a fully automated, multi-agent AI workflow using LLaMA 3 8B to identify cognitive concerns in 3,338 clinical notes from Mass General Brigham. The agentic workflow, leveraging task-specific agents that dynamically collaborate to extract meaningful insights from clinical notes, was compared to an expert-driven benchmark. Both workflows achieved high classification performance, with F1-scores of 0.90 and 0.91, respectively. The agentic workflow demonstrated improved specificity (1.00) and achieved prompt refinement in fewer iterations. Although both workflows showed reduced performance on validation data, the agentic workflow maintained perfect specificity. These findings highlight the potential of fully automated multi-agent AI workflows to achieve expert-level accuracy with greater efficiency, offering a scalable and cost-effective solution for detecting cognitive concerns in clinical settings.</p></details> |  |

However, there is currently no structured framework for documenting the technical components, intended uses, and safety features of agentic systems. To fill this gap, we introduce the AI Agent Index, the first public database to document information about currently deployed agentic AI systems. For each system that meets the criteria for inclusion in the index, we document the system's components (e.g., base model, reasoning implementation, tool use), application domains (e.g., computer use, software engineering), and risk management practices (e.g., evaluation results, guardrails), based on publicly available information and correspondence with developers. We find that while developers generally provide ample information regarding the capabilities and applications of agentic systems, they currently provide limited information regarding safety and risk management practices.

To bridge this gap, we propose a new evaluation task for temporal reasoning in multi-session dialogues and introduce an approach to construct a new benchmark by augmenting dialogues from LoCoMo and creating multi-choice QAs. Furthermore, we present TReMu, a new framework aimed at enhancing the temporal reasoning capabilities of LLM-agents in this context. Specifically, the framework employs \textit{time-aware memorization} through timeline summarization, generating retrievable memory by summarizing events in each dialogue session with their inferred dates. Additionally, we integrate \textit{neuro-symbolic temporal reasoning}, where LLMs generate Python code to perform temporal calculations and select answers. Experimental evaluations on popular LLMs demonstrate that our benchmark is challenging, and the proposed framework significantly improves temporal reasoning performance compared to baseline methods, raising from 29.83 on GPT-4o via standard prompting to 77.67 via our approach and highlighting its effectiveness in addressing temporal reasoning in multi-session dialogues.</p></details> |  |

Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) make them a viable option as a knowledge backbone. LLMs behaviour can be enhanced through prompting, instructing them to perform downstream tasks in a zero-shot fashion (i.e. without training). To this end, we incorporated structural knowledge into prompts and used prompted LLMs to prototyping domain-specific CAs. We demonstrate a case study in a specific domain-textile circularity - TextileBot, we present the design, development, and evaluation of the TextileBot. Specially, we conducted an in-person user study (N=30) with Free Chat and Information-Gathering tasks with TextileBots to gather insights from the interaction. We analyse the human-agent interactions, combining quantitative and qualitative methods. Our results suggest that participants engaged in multi-turn conversations, and their perceptions of the three variation agents and respective interactions varied demonstrating the effectiveness of our prompt-based LLM approach. We discuss the dynamics of these interactions and their implications for designing future voice-based CAs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at Behaviour and Information Technology Journal</p></details> |

Current LLM agents, particularly those based on proprietary language models, typically rely on prompts to incorporate knowledge about the target tasks. This approach does not allow the agent to internalize this information and instead relies on ever-expanding prompts to sustain its functionality in diverse scenarios. This resembles a system of notes used by a person affected by anterograde amnesia, the inability to form new memories. In this paper, we propose a novel method to train AI agents to incorporate knowledge and skills for multiple tasks without the need for either cumbersome note systems or prior high-quality demonstration data. Our approach employs an iterative process where the agent collects new experiences, receives corrective feedback from humans in the form of hints, and integrates this feedback into its weights via a context distillation training procedure. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by implementing it in a Llama-3-based agent which, after only a few rounds of feedback, outperforms advanced models GPT-4o and DeepSeek-V3 in a taskset requiring correct sequencing of information retrieval, tool use, and question answering.</p></details> |  |

Meanwhile, global interest in building large, complex systems in software, manufacturing, energy and logistics has never been greater. Although AI driven system engineering holds tremendous promise, the static benchmarks dominating agent evaluations today fail to capture the crucial skills required for implementing dynamic systems, such as managing uncertain trade-offs and ensuring proactive adaptability. This position paper advocates for training and evaluating AI agents' system engineering abilities through automation-oriented sandbox games-particularly Factorio. By directing research efforts in this direction, we can equip AI agents with the specialized reasoning and long-horizon planning necessary to design, maintain, and optimize tomorrow's most demanding engineering projects.</p></details> |  |

Tools like LangChain and Retrieval-Augmented Generation have expanded LLM capabilities, enabling deeper integration into MAS through enhanced knowledge retrieval and reasoning. However, these advancements introduce critical challenges: LLM agents exhibit inherent unpredictability, and uncertainties in their outputs can compound across interactions, threatening system stability. To address these risks, a human-centered design approach with active dynamic moderation is essential. Such an approach enhances traditional passive oversight by facilitating coherent inter-agent communication and effective system governance, allowing MAS to achieve desired outcomes more efficiently.</p></details> | Under Review |

We expand on the key concepts, present three scenarios -- medical triage, financial risk assessment, and agile engineering -- and demonstrate how Layered-CoT surpasses vanilla CoT in terms of transparency, correctness, and user engagement. By integrating references from recent arXiv papers on interactive explainability, multi-agent frameworks, and agent-based collaboration, we illustrate how Layered-CoT paves the way for more reliable and grounded explanations in high-stakes domains.</p></details> |  |

This study explores the use of Large Language Model (LLM) agents within a novel framework to simulate and analyze the dynamics of rumor propagation across social networks.

Our framework assesses the effectiveness of different network constructions and agent behaviors in influencing the spread of rumors. Our results demonstrate that the framework can simulate rumor spreading across more than one hundred agents in various networks with thousands of edges. The evaluations indicate that network structure, personas, and spreading schemes can significantly influence rumor dissemination, ranging from no spread to affecting 83\% of agents in iterations, thereby offering a realistic simulation of rumor spread in social networks.</p></details> | 7 pages, 8 figures |

However, their roles in enhancing model generalization capabilities remain unclear. This paper studies the difference between SFT and RL on generalization and memorization, focusing on text-based rule variants and visual variants. We introduce GeneralPoints, an arithmetic reasoning card game, and adopt V-IRL, a real-world navigation environment, to assess how models trained with SFT and RL generalize to unseen variants in both textual and visual domains. We show that RL, especially when trained with an outcome-based reward, generalizes across both rule-based textual and visual variants. SFT, in contrast, tends to memorize training data and struggles to generalize out-of-distribution scenarios. Further analysis reveals that RL improves the model's underlying visual recognition capabilities, contributing to its enhanced generalization in the visual domain. Despite RL's superior generalization, we show that SFT remains essential for effective RL training; SFT stabilizes the model's output format, enabling subsequent RL to achieve its performance gains. These findings demonstrates the capability of RL for acquiring generalizable knowledge in complex, multi-modal tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website at https://tianzhechu.com/SFTvsRL</p></details> |

We investigate this problem in a principled manner by identifying the source of the misalignment as a form of distributional shift and uncertainty in learning human preferences. To mitigate overoptimization, we first propose a theoretical algorithm that chooses the best policy for an adversarially chosen reward model; one that simultaneously minimizes the maximum likelihood estimation of the loss and a reward penalty term. Here, the reward penalty term is introduced to prevent the policy from choosing actions with spurious high proxy rewards, resulting in provable sample efficiency of the algorithm under a partial coverage style condition. Moving from theory to practice, the proposed algorithm further enjoys an equivalent but surprisingly easy-to-implement reformulation. Using the equivalence between reward models and the corresponding optimal policy, the algorithm features a simple objective that combines: (i) a preference optimization loss that directly aligns the policy with human preference, and (ii) a supervised learning loss that explicitly imitates the policy with a (suitable) baseline distribution. In the context of aligning large language models (LLM), this objective fuses the direct preference optimization (DPO) loss with the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) loss to help mitigate the overoptimization towards undesired responses, for which we name the algorithm Regularized Preference Optimization (RPO). Experiments of aligning LLMs demonstrate the improved performance of RPO compared with DPO baselines. Our work sheds light on the interplay between preference optimization and SFT in tuning LLMs with both theoretical guarantees and empirical evidence.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by The Thirty-Eighth Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems. 31 pages, 7 figures</p></details> |
| **[Continual SFT Matches Multimodal RLHF with Negative Supervision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14797v1)** | 2024-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal RLHF usually happens after supervised finetuning (SFT) stage to continually improve vision-language models' (VLMs) comprehension. Conventional wisdom holds its superiority over continual SFT during this preference alignment stage. In this paper, we observe that the inherent value of multimodal RLHF lies in its negative supervision, the logit of the rejected responses. We thus propose a novel negative supervised finetuning (nSFT) approach that fully excavates these information resided. Our nSFT disentangles this negative supervision in RLHF paradigm, and continually aligns VLMs with a simple SFT loss. This is more memory efficient than multimodal RLHF where 2 (e.g., DPO) or 4 (e.g., PPO) large VLMs are strictly required. The effectiveness of nSFT is rigorously proved by comparing it with various multimodal RLHF approaches, across different dataset sources, base VLMs and evaluation metrics. Besides, fruitful of ablations are provided to support our hypothesis. We hope this paper will stimulate further research to properly align large vision language models.</p></details> |  |
| **[UFT: Unifying Fine-Tuning of SFT and RLHF/DPO/UNA through a Generalized Implicit Reward Function](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21438v1)** | 2024-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>By pretraining on trillions of tokens, an LLM gains the capability of text generation. However, to enhance its utility and reduce potential harm, SFT and alignment are applied sequentially to the pretrained model. Due to the differing nature and objective functions of SFT and alignment, catastrophic forgetting has become a significant issue. To address this, we introduce Unified Fine-Tuning (UFT), which integrates SFT and alignment into a single training stage using the same objective and loss functions through an implicit reward function. Our experimental results demonstrate that UFT outperforms SFT on instruction-tuning data alone. Moreover, when combining instruction-tuning data with alignment data, UFT effectively prevents catastrophic forgetting across these two stages and shows a clear advantage over sequentially applying SFT and alignment. This is evident in the significant improvements observed in the \textbf{ifeval} task for instruction-following and the \textbf{truthful-qa} task for factuality. The proposed general fine-tuning framework UFT establishes an effective and efficient pretraining-UFT paradigm for LLM training.</p></details> |  |

State-of-the-art techniques such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) often consist of two stages: 1) supervised fine-tuning (SFT), where the model is fine-tuned by learning from human demonstration data; 2) Preference learning, where preference data is used to learn a reward model, which is in turn used by a reinforcement learning (RL) step to fine-tune the model. Such reward model serves as a proxy to human preference, and it is critical to guide the RL step towards improving the model quality. In this work, we argue that the SFT stage significantly benefits from learning a reward model as well. Instead of using the human demonstration data directly via supervised learning, we propose to leverage an Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) technique to simultaneously build an reward model and a policy model. This approach leads to new SFT algorithms that are not only efficient to implement, but are robust to the presence of low-quality supervised learning data. Moreover, we discover a connection between the proposed IRL based approach, and a recent line of works called Self-Play Fine-tune (SPIN). Theoretically, we show that the proposed algorithms converge to the stationary solutions of the IRL problem. Empirically, we align 1B and 7B models using proposed methods and evaluate them on a reward benchmark model and the HuggingFace Open LLM Leaderboard. The proposed methods show significant performance improvement over existing SFT approaches.

The paradigm contains supervised fine tuning and reinforce learning from human feedback. This paradigm is also used in downstream scenarios to adapt LLM to specific corpora and applications. Comparing to SFT, there are many efforts focused on RLHF and several algorithms being proposed, such as PPO, DPO, IPO, KTO, MinorDPO and etc. Meanwhile most efforts for SFT are focused on how to collect, filter and mix high quality data. In this article with insight from DPO and MinorDPO, we propose a training metric for SFT to measure the discrepancy between the optimized model and the original model, and a loss function MinorSFT that can increase the training effectiveness, and reduce the discrepancy between the optimized LLM and original LLM.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |

| **[Automatically Generating Numerous Context-Driven SFT Data for LLMs across Diverse Granularity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16579v1)** | 2024-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Constructing high-quality query-response pairs from custom corpus is crucial for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) large language models (LLMs) in many applications, like creating domain-specific AI assistants or roleplaying agents. However, sourcing this data through human annotation is costly, and existing automated methods often fail to capture the diverse range of contextual granularity and tend to produce homogeneous data. To tackle these issues, we introduce a novel method named AugCon, capable of automatically generating context-driven SFT data across multiple levels of granularity with high diversity, quality and fidelity. AugCon begins by generating queries using the Context-Split-Tree (CST), an innovative approach for recursively deriving queries and splitting context to cover full granularity. Then, we train a scorer through contrastive learning to collaborate with CST to rank and refine queries. Finally, a synergistic integration of self-alignment and self-improving is introduced to obtain high-fidelity responses. Extensive experiments are conducted incorporating both human and automatic evaluations, encompassing a test scenario and four widely-used benchmarks in English and Chinese. The results highlight the significant advantages of AugCon in producing high diversity, quality, and fidelity SFT data against several state-of-the-art methods. All of our code, dataset, and fine-tuned model will be available at: https://github.com/quanshr/AugCon.</p></details> |  |

It typically consists of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) stages. However, RLHF faces inherent limitations stemming from a complex training setup and its tendency to align the model with implicit values that end users cannot control at run-time. Moreover, reward models in RLHF stage commonly rely on single-dimensional feedback as opposed to explicit, multifaceted signals that indicate attributes such as helpfulness, humor, and toxicity. To address these limitations, we propose SteerLM, a supervised fine-tuning method that empowers end-users to control responses during inference. SteerLM conditions responses to conform to an explicitly defined multi-dimensional set of attributes, thereby empowering a steerable AI capable of generating helpful and high-quality responses while maintaining customizability. Experiments show that SteerLM trained on open source datasets generates responses that are preferred by human and automatic evaluators to many state-of-the-art baselines trained with RLHF while being much easier to train.

However, as the number of cascades increases, the improvements in reconstruction tend to become marginal, indicating possible excess model capacity. Knowledge distillation (KD) is an emerging technique to compress these models, in which a trained deep teacher network is used to distill knowledge to a smaller student network such that the student learns to mimic the behavior of the teacher. Most KD methods focus on effectively training the student with a pre-trained teacher unaware of the student model. We propose SFT-KD-Recon, a student-friendly teacher training approach along with the student as a prior step to KD to make the teacher aware of the structure and capacity of the student and enable aligning the representations of the teacher with the student. In SFT, the teacher is jointly trained with the unfolded branch configurations of the student blocks using three loss terms - teacher-reconstruction loss, student-reconstruction loss, and teacher-student imitation loss, followed by KD of the student. We perform extensive experiments for MRI acceleration in 4x and 5x under-sampling on the brain and cardiac datasets on five KD methods using the proposed approach as a prior step. We consider the DC-CNN architecture and setup teacher as D5C5 (141765 parameters), and student as D3C5 (49285 parameters), denoting a compression of 2.87:1. Results show that (i) our approach consistently improves the KD methods with improved reconstruction performance and image quality, and (ii) the student distilled using our approach is competitive with the teacher, with the performance gap reduced from 0.53 dB to 0.03 dB.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 8 figures.

Our proof is based on a structural theorem by Whyte and on two constructions of strongly aperiodic SFTs on $\mathbb{F}_n\times \mathbb{Z}$ and $BS(m,n)$ of our own. Our two constructions rely on a path-folding technique that lifts an SFT on $\mathbb{Z}^2$ inside an SFT on $\mathbb{F}_n\times \mathbb{Z}$ or an SFT on the hyperbolic plane inside an SFT on $BS(m,n)$. In the case of $\mathbb{F}_n\times \mathbb{Z}$ the path folding technique also preserves minimality, so that we get minimal strongly aperiodic SFTs on unimodular GBS groups.</p></details> | 31 pages, 13 figures |

As a consequence, if $P$ contains a recursive member, $P$ and $X$ have the exact same set of Turing degrees. On the other hand, we prove that if $X$ contains only non-recursive members, some of its members always have different but comparable degrees. This gives a fairly complete study of Turing degrees of SFTs.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1102.1189</p></details> |

| **[The Energy Loss Phenomenon in RLHF: A New Perspective on Mitigating Reward Hacking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19358v2)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work identifies the Energy Loss Phenomenon in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and its connection to reward hacking. Specifically, energy loss in the final layer of a Large Language Model (LLM) gradually increases during the RL process, with an excessive increase in energy loss characterizing reward hacking. Beyond empirical analysis, we further provide a theoretical foundation by proving that, under mild conditions, the increased energy loss reduces the upper bound of contextual relevance in LLMs, which is a critical aspect of reward hacking as the reduced contextual relevance typically indicates overfitting to reward model-favored patterns in RL. To address this issue, we propose an Energy loss-aware PPO algorithm (EPPO) which penalizes the increase in energy loss in the LLM's final layer during reward calculation to prevent excessive energy loss, thereby mitigating reward hacking. We theoretically show that EPPO can be conceptually interpreted as an entropy-regularized RL algorithm, which provides deeper insights into its effectiveness. Extensive experiments across various LLMs and tasks demonstrate the commonality of the energy loss phenomenon, as well as the effectiveness of EPPO in mitigating reward hacking and improving RLHF performance.</p></details> | 28 pages, 21 figures |

Incorporating multiple reference models has the potential to address these limitations by broadening perspectives, reducing bias, and leveraging the strengths of diverse open-source LLMs. However, integrating multiple reference models into reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) frameworks poses significant theoretical challenges, particularly in reverse KL-regularization, where achieving exact solutions has remained an open problem. This paper presents the first \emph{exact solution} to the multiple reference model problem in reverse KL-regularized RLHF. We introduce a comprehensive theoretical framework that includes rigorous statistical analysis and provides sample complexity guarantees. Additionally, we extend our analysis to forward KL-regularized RLHF, offering new insights into sample complexity requirements in multiple reference scenarios. Our contributions lay the foundation for more advanced and adaptable LLM alignment techniques, enabling the effective use of multiple reference models. This work paves the way for developing alignment frameworks that are both theoretically sound and better suited to the challenges of modern AI ecosystems.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[Avoiding $\mathbf{exp(R_{max})}$ scaling in RLHF through Preference-based Exploration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00666v1)** | 2025-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a pivotal technique for large language model (LLM) alignment. This paper studies the setting of online RLHF and focus on improving sample efficiency. All existing algorithms in online RLHF, whether doing passive exploration or active exploration, suffer from a sample complexity that scales exponentially with the scale of the reward function. This fundamental limitation hinders their effectiveness in scenarios with heavily skewed preferences, e.g. questions with a unique correct solution. To address this, we introduce Self-Exploring Preference-Incentive Online Preference Optimization (SE-POPO), an online RLHF algorithm that for the first time achieves a sample complexity that scales polynomially with the reward scale, answering an open problem raised by Xie et al. (2024).. Theoretically, we demonstrate that the sample complexity of SE-POPO dominates that of existing exploration algorithms. Empirically, our systematic evaluation confirms that SE-POPO is more sample-efficient than both exploratory and non-exploratory baselines, in two primary application scenarios of RLHF as well as on public benchmarks, marking a significant step forward in RLHF algorithm design.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Federated RLHF with Aggregated Client Preference for LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03038v2)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) fine-tunes a pretrained large language model (LLM) using user preference data, enabling it to generate content aligned with human preferences. However, due to privacy concerns, users may be reluctant to share sensitive preference data. To address this, we propose utilizing Federated Learning (FL) techniques, allowing large-scale preference collection from diverse real-world users without requiring them to transmit data to a central server. Our federated RLHF methods (i.e., FedBis and FedBiscuit) encode each client's preferences into binary selectors and aggregate them to capture common preferences. In particular, FedBiscuit overcomes key challenges, such as preference heterogeneity and reward hacking, through innovative solutions like grouping clients with similar preferences to reduce heterogeneity and using multiple binary selectors to enhance LLM output quality. To evaluate the performance of the proposed methods, we establish the first federated RLHF benchmark with a heterogeneous human preference dataset. Experimental results show that by integrating the LLM with aggregated client preferences, FedBis and FedBiscuit significantly enhance the professionalism and readability of the generated content.</p></details> | ICLR'25 |

It has been shown to enhance both generation quality and trustworthiness. While numerous works have focused on improving retrieval, generation, and evaluation, the role of reward models in reinforcement learning for optimizing RAG and establishing automated benchmarking pipelines remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{RAG-Reward}, a dataset designed to enable \textit{hallucination-free, comprehensive, reliable, and efficient RAG}. We define four key metrics for assessing generation quality and develop an automated annotation pipeline that leverages multiple LLMs to generate outputs across diverse RAG scenarios. GPT-4o is used to evaluate and construct preference data. Using \textbf{RAG-Reward}, we train reward models and apply reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) to improve LLMs' effectiveness in RAG. Experimental results show that our reward model achieves state-of-the-art performance on a held-out test set, demonstrating both the effectiveness of our approach and the quality of our dataset. Furthermore, the improved generation quality of the trained policy model highlights the feasibility of using RLHF to enhance RAG pipelines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint, work in progress</p></details> |

While Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has shown promise for optimizing model performance using human judgments, existing RLHF pipelines predominantly rely on immediate feedback, which can fail to accurately reflect the downstream impact of an interaction on users' utility. We demonstrate that feedback based on evaluators' foresight estimates of downstream consequences systematically induces Goodhart's Law dynamics, incentivizing misaligned behaviors like sycophancy and deception and ultimately degrading user outcomes. To alleviate this, we propose decoupling evaluation from prediction by refocusing RLHF on hindsight feedback. Our theoretical analysis reveals that conditioning evaluator feedback on downstream observations mitigates misalignment and improves expected human utility, even when these observations are simulated by the AI system itself. To leverage this insight in a practical alignment algorithm, we introduce Reinforcement Learning from Hindsight Simulation (RLHS), which first simulates plausible consequences and then elicits feedback to assess what behaviors were genuinely beneficial in hindsight. We apply RLHS to two widely-employed online and offline preference optimization methods -- Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) -- and show empirically that misalignment is significantly reduced with both methods. Through an online human user study, we show that RLHS consistently outperforms RLHF in helping users achieve their goals and earns higher satisfaction ratings, despite being trained solely with simulated hindsight feedback. These results underscore the importance of focusing on long-term consequences, even simulated ones, to mitigate misalignment in RLHF.</p></details> |  |
| **[Influencing Humans to Conform to Preference Models for RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06416v1)** | 2025-01-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Designing a reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) algorithm to approximate a human's unobservable reward function requires assuming, implicitly or explicitly, a model of human preferences. A preference model that poorly describes how humans generate preferences risks learning a poor approximation of the human's reward function. In this paper, we conduct three human studies to asses whether one can influence the expression of real human preferences to more closely conform to a desired preference model. Importantly, our approach does not seek to alter the human's unobserved reward function. Rather, we change how humans use this reward function to generate preferences, such that they better match whatever preference model is assumed by a particular RLHF algorithm. We introduce three interventions: showing humans the quantities that underlie a preference model, which is normally unobservable information derived from the reward function; training people to follow a specific preference model; and modifying the preference elicitation question. All intervention types show significant effects, providing practical tools to improve preference data quality and the resultant alignment of the learned reward functions. Overall we establish a novel research direction in model alignment: designing interfaces and training interventions to increase human conformance with the modeling assumptions of the algorithm that will learn from their input.</p></details> |  |
| **[Segmenting Text and Learning Their Rewards for Improved RLHF in Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02790v1)** | 2025-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has been widely adopted to align language models (LMs) with human preference. Prior RLHF works typically take a bandit formulation, which, though intuitive, ignores the sequential nature of LM generation and can suffer from the sparse reward issue. While recent works propose dense token-level RLHF, treating each token as an action may be oversubtle to proper reward assignment. In this paper, we seek to get the best of both by training and utilizing a segment-level reward model, which assigns a reward to each semantically complete text segment that spans over a short sequence of tokens. For reward learning, our method allows dynamic text segmentation and compatibility with standard sequence-preference datasets. For effective RL-based LM training against segment reward, we generalize the classical scalar bandit reward normalizers into location-aware normalizer functions and interpolate the segment reward for further densification. With these designs, our method performs competitively on three popular RLHF benchmarks for LM policy: AlpacaEval 2.0, Arena-Hard, and MT-Bench. Ablation studies are conducted to further demonstrate our method.</p></details> |  |

Automatic Analysis of Refusal Composition in IFT/RLHF Datasets and Refusal Behavior of Black-Box LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16974v1)** | 2024-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Refusals - instances where large language models (LLMs) decline or fail to fully execute user instructions - are crucial for both AI safety and AI capabilities and the reduction of hallucinations in particular. These behaviors are learned during post-training, especially in instruction fine-tuning (IFT) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). However, existing taxonomies and evaluation datasets for refusals are inadequate, often focusing solely on should-not-related (instead of cannot-related) categories, and lacking tools for auditing refusal content in black-box LLM outputs. We present a comprehensive framework for classifying LLM refusals: (a) a taxonomy of 16 refusal categories, (b) a human-annotated dataset of over 8,600 instances from publicly available IFT and RLHF datasets, (c) a synthetic dataset with 8,000 examples for each refusal category, and (d) classifiers trained for refusal classification. Our work enables precise auditing of refusal behaviors in black-box LLMs and automatic analyses of refusal patterns in large IFT and RLHF datasets. This facilitates the strategic adjustment of LLM refusals, contributing to the development of more safe and reliable LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024 Workshop SFLLM</p></details> |

On The Impact of Preference Alignment On Trustworthiness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18870v2)** | 2024-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The trustworthiness of Large Language Models (LLMs) refers to the extent to which their outputs are reliable, safe, and ethically aligned, and it has become a crucial consideration alongside their cognitive performance. In practice, Reinforcement Learning From Human Feedback (RLHF) has been widely used to align LLMs with labeled human preferences, but its assumed effect on model trustworthiness hasn't been rigorously evaluated. To bridge this knowledge gap, this study investigates how models aligned with general-purpose preference data perform across five trustworthiness verticals: toxicity, stereotypical bias, machine ethics, truthfulness, and privacy. Our results demonstrate that RLHF on human preferences doesn't automatically guarantee trustworthiness, and reverse effects are often observed. Furthermore, we propose to adapt efficient influence function based data attribution methods to the RLHF setting to better understand the influence of fine-tuning data on individual trustworthiness benchmarks, and show its feasibility by providing our estimated attribution scores. Together, our results underscore the need for more nuanced approaches for model alignment from both the data and framework perspectives, and we hope this research will guide the community towards developing language models that are increasingly capable without sacrificing trustworthiness.</p></details> |  |

We introduce Federated Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (FedRLHF), a novel framework that decentralizes the RLHF process. FedRLHF enables collaborative policy learning across multiple clients without necessitating the sharing of raw data or human feedback, thereby ensuring robust privacy preservation. Leveraging federated reinforcement learning, each client integrates human feedback locally into their reward functions and updates their policies through personalized RLHF processes. We establish rigorous theoretical foundations for FedRLHF, providing convergence guarantees, and deriving sample complexity bounds that scale efficiently with the number of clients. Empirical evaluations on the MovieLens and IMDb datasets demonstrate that FedRLHF not only preserves user privacy but also achieves performance on par with centralized RLHF, while enhancing personalization across diverse client environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAMAS 2025.

| **[Solving the Inverse Alignment Problem for Efficient RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10529v1)** | 2024-12-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Collecting high-quality preference datasets for reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is resource-intensive and challenging. As a result, researchers often train reward models on extensive offline datasets which aggregate diverse generation sources and scoring/alignment policies. We hypothesize that this aggregation has an averaging effect on reward model scores, which limits signal and impairs the alignment process. Inspired by the field of inverse RL, we define the 'inverse alignment problem' in language model training, where our objective is to optimize the critic's reward for a fixed actor and a fixed offline preference dataset. We hypothesize that solving the inverse alignment problem will improve reward model quality by providing clearer feedback on the policy's current behavior. To that end, we investigate whether repeatedly fine-tuning a reward model on subsets of the offline preference dataset aligned with a periodically frozen policy during RLHF improves upon vanilla RLHF. Our empirical results demonstrate that this approach facilitates superior alignment and faster convergence compared to using an unaligned or out-of-distribution reward model relative to the LLM policy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Policy Filtration in RLHF to Fine-Tune LLM for Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06957v2)** | 2024-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is one of the key techniques that helps large language models (LLMs) to follow instructions and provide helpful and harmless responses. While direct policy optimization methods exist, state-of-the-art LLMs adopt RL-based methods (usually PPO) in RLHF to train the policy to generate good responses guided by a reward model learned from preference data. The main challenge of these methods is the inaccuracy of the intermediate reward model, especially in code generation tasks that require long and complex reasoning to score a response. We find that the reliability of the reward model varies across responses assigned with different rewards. This motivates us to filter the samples whose rewards may be unreliable to improve signal-to-noise ratio during policy learning, resulting in Policy Filtration for Proximal Policy Optimization (PF-PPO). To choose a proper policy filtration strategy for a given reward model, the coefficient of determination ($R^2$) between rewards and actual scores on filtered samples serves as a good metrics and helps us find several promising strategies. We provide extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of PF-PPO in code generation tasks, and find that some variants of PF-PPO are highly effective and achieve new state-of-the-art performance across 7-billion-parameter models on HumanEval, MBPP, and a new and more challenging LeetCode Contest benchmark.</p></details> |  |
| **[Does RLHF Scale? Exploring the Impacts From Data, Model, and Method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06000v1)** | 2024-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study explores the scaling properties of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) in Large Language Models (LLMs). Although RLHF is considered an important step in post-training of LLMs, its scaling potential is still largely unknown. We systematically analyze key components in the RLHF framework--model size, data composition, and inference budget--and their impacts on performance. Our findings show that increasing data diversity and volume improves reward model performance, helping process-supervision models scale better. For policy training, more response samples per prompt boost performance initially but quickly plateau. And larger reward models offer modest gains in policy training. In addition, larger policy models benefit less from RLHF with a fixed reward model. Overall, RLHF scales less efficiently than pretraining, with diminishing returns from additional computational resources. Based on these observations, we propose strategies to optimize RLHF performance within computational limits.</p></details> |  |
| **[Language Models Learn to Mislead Humans via RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12822v3)** | 2024-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language models (LMs) can produce errors that are hard to detect for humans, especially when the task is complex. RLHF, the most popular post-training method, may exacerbate this problem: to achieve higher rewards, LMs might get better at convincing humans that they are right even when they are wrong. We study this phenomenon under a standard RLHF pipeline, calling it "U-SOPHISTRY" since it is Unintended by model developers. Specifically, we ask time-constrained (e.g., 3-10 minutes) human subjects to evaluate the correctness of model outputs and calculate humans' accuracy against gold labels. On a question-answering task (QuALITY) and programming task (APPS), RLHF makes LMs better at convincing our subjects but not at completing the task correctly. RLHF also makes the model harder to evaluate: our subjects' false positive rate increases by 24.1% on QuALITY and 18.3% on APPS. Finally, we show that probing, a state-of-the-art approach for detecting Intended Sophistry (e.g. backdoored LMs), does not generalize to U-SOPHISTRY. Our results highlight an important failure mode of RLHF and call for more research in assisting humans to align them.</p></details> |  |
| **[Provably Mitigating Overoptimization in RLHF: Your SFT Loss is Implicitly an Adversarial Regularizer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16436v3)** | 2024-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aligning generative models with human preference via RLHF typically suffers from overoptimization, where an imperfectly learned reward model can misguide the generative model to output undesired responses. We investigate this problem in a principled manner by identifying the source of the misalignment as a form of distributional shift and uncertainty in learning human preferences. To mitigate overoptimization, we first propose a theoretical algorithm that chooses the best policy for an adversarially chosen reward model; one that simultaneously minimizes the maximum likelihood estimation of the loss and a reward penalty term. Here, the reward penalty term is introduced to prevent the policy from choosing actions with spurious high proxy rewards, resulting in provable sample efficiency of the algorithm under a partial coverage style condition. Moving from theory to practice, the proposed algorithm further enjoys an equivalent but surprisingly easy-to-implement reformulation. Using the equivalence between reward models and the corresponding optimal policy, the algorithm features a simple objective that combines: (i) a preference optimization loss that directly aligns the policy with human preference, and (ii) a supervised learning loss that explicitly imitates the policy with a (suitable) baseline distribution. In the context of aligning large language models (LLM), this objective fuses the direct preference optimization (DPO) loss with the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) loss to help mitigate the overoptimization towards undesired responses, for which we name the algorithm Regularized Preference Optimization (RPO). Experiments of aligning LLMs demonstrate the improved performance of RPO compared with DPO baselines. Our work sheds light on the interplay between preference optimization and SFT in tuning LLMs with both theoretical guarantees and empirical evidence.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by The Thirty-Eighth Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems. 31 pages, 7 figures</p></details> |

However, unlike pretraining or fine-tuning a single model, scaling reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) for training large language models poses coordination challenges across four models. We present OpenRLHF, an open-source framework enabling efficient RLHF scaling. Unlike existing RLHF frameworks that co-locate four models on the same GPUs, OpenRLHF re-designs scheduling for the models beyond 70B parameters using Ray, vLLM, and DeepSpeed, leveraging improved resource utilization and diverse training approaches. Integrating seamlessly with Hugging Face, OpenRLHF provides an out-of-the-box solution with optimized algorithms and launch scripts, which ensures user-friendliness. OpenRLHF implements RLHF, DPO, rejection sampling, and other alignment techniques.

| **[Continual SFT Matches Multimodal RLHF with Negative Supervision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14797v1)** | 2024-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal RLHF usually happens after supervised finetuning (SFT) stage to continually improve vision-language models' (VLMs) comprehension. Conventional wisdom holds its superiority over continual SFT during this preference alignment stage. In this paper, we observe that the inherent value of multimodal RLHF lies in its negative supervision, the logit of the rejected responses. We thus propose a novel negative supervised finetuning (nSFT) approach that fully excavates these information resided. Our nSFT disentangles this negative supervision in RLHF paradigm, and continually aligns VLMs with a simple SFT loss. This is more memory efficient than multimodal RLHF where 2 (e.g., DPO) or 4 (e.g., PPO) large VLMs are strictly required. The effectiveness of nSFT is rigorously proved by comparing it with various multimodal RLHF approaches, across different dataset sources, base VLMs and evaluation metrics. Besides, fruitful of ablations are provided to support our hypothesis. We hope this paper will stimulate further research to properly align large vision language models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Value Imprint: A Technique for Auditing the Human Values Embedded in RLHF Datasets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11937v1)** | 2024-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs are increasingly fine-tuned using RLHF datasets to align them with human preferences and values. However, very limited research has investigated which specific human values are operationalized through these datasets. In this paper, we introduce Value Imprint, a framework for auditing and classifying the human values embedded within RLHF datasets. To investigate the viability of this framework, we conducted three case study experiments by auditing the Anthropic/hh-rlhf, OpenAI WebGPT Comparisons, and Alpaca GPT-4-LLM datasets to examine the human values embedded within them. Our analysis involved a two-phase process. During the first phase, we developed a taxonomy of human values through an integrated review of prior works from philosophy, axiology, and ethics. Then, we applied this taxonomy to annotate 6,501 RLHF preferences. During the second phase, we employed the labels generated from the annotation as ground truth data for training a transformer-based machine learning model to audit and classify the three RLHF datasets. Through this approach, we discovered that information-utility values, including Wisdom/Knowledge and Information Seeking, were the most dominant human values within all three RLHF datasets. In contrast, prosocial and democratic values, including Well-being, Justice, and Human/Animal Rights, were the least represented human values. These findings have significant implications for developing language models that align with societal values and norms. We contribute our datasets to support further research in this area.</p></details> |  |
| **[RLHF Workflow: From Reward Modeling to Online RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07863v3)** | 2024-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present the workflow of Online Iterative Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) in this technical report, which is widely reported to outperform its offline counterpart by a large margin in the recent large language model (LLM) literature. However, existing open-source RLHF projects are still largely confined to the offline learning setting. In this technical report, we aim to fill in this gap and provide a detailed recipe that is easy to reproduce for online iterative RLHF. In particular, since online human feedback is usually infeasible for open-source communities with limited resources, we start by constructing preference models using a diverse set of open-source datasets and use the constructed proxy preference model to approximate human feedback. Then, we discuss the theoretical insights and algorithmic principles behind online iterative RLHF, followed by a detailed practical implementation. Our trained LLM achieves impressive performance on LLM chatbot benchmarks, including AlpacaEval-2, Arena-Hard, and MT-Bench, as well as other academic benchmarks such as HumanEval and TruthfulQA. We have shown that supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and iterative RLHF can obtain state-of-the-art performance with fully open-source datasets. Further, we have made our models, curated datasets, and comprehensive step-by-step code guidebooks publicly available.

| **[A Theoretical Framework for Partially Observed Reward-States in RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03282v3)** | 2024-11-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing deployment of reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) calls for a deeper theoretical investigation of its underlying models. The prevalent models of RLHF do not account for neuroscience-backed, partially-observed "internal states" that can affect human feedback, nor do they accommodate intermediate feedback during an interaction. Both of these can be instrumental in speeding up learning and improving alignment. To address these limitations, we model RLHF as reinforcement learning with partially observed reward-states (PORRL). We accommodate two kinds of feedback $-$ cardinal and dueling feedback. We first demonstrate that PORRL subsumes a wide class of RL problems, including traditional RL, RLHF, and reward machines. For cardinal feedback, we present two model-based methods (POR-UCRL, POR-UCBVI). We give both cardinal regret and sample complexity guarantees for the methods, showing that they improve over naive history-summarization. We then discuss the benefits of a model-free method like GOLF with naive history-summarization in settings with recursive internal states and dense intermediate feedback. For this purpose, we define a new history aware version of the Bellman-eluder dimension and give a new guarantee for GOLF in our setting, which can be exponentially sharper in illustrative examples. For dueling feedback, we show that a naive reduction to cardinal feedback fails to achieve sublinear dueling regret. We then present the first explicit reduction that converts guarantees for cardinal regret to dueling regret. In both feedback settings, we show that our models and guarantees generalize and extend existing ones.</p></details> | <details><summary>64 pa...</summary><p>64 pages. 14 pages for main paper, 50 pages for references + appendix</p></details> |
| **[Catastrophic Goodhart: regularizing RLHF with KL divergence does not mitigate heavy-tailed reward misspecification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14503v2)** | 2024-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When applying reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), the reward is learned from data and, therefore, always has some error. It is common to mitigate this by regularizing the policy with KL divergence from a base model, with the hope that balancing reward with regularization will achieve desirable outcomes despite this reward misspecification. We show that when the reward function has light-tailed error, optimal policies under less restrictive KL penalties achieve arbitrarily high utility. However, if error is heavy-tailed, some policies obtain arbitrarily high reward despite achieving no more utility than the base model--a phenomenon we call catastrophic Goodhart. We adapt a discrete optimization method to measure the tails of reward models, finding that they are consistent with light-tailed error. However, the pervasiveness of heavy-tailed distributions in many real-world applications indicates that future sources of RL reward could have heavy-tailed error, increasing the likelihood of reward hacking even with KL regularization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Mecha...</summary><p>Mechanistic Interpretability workshop at ICML 2024; Main conference poster at NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |
| **[Sharp Analysis for KL-Regularized Contextual Bandits and RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04625v1)** | 2024-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reverse-Kullback-Leibler (KL) regularization has emerged to be a predominant technique used to enhance policy optimization in reinforcement learning (RL) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), which forces the learned policy to stay close to a reference policy. While the effectiveness and necessity of KL-regularization have been empirically demonstrated in various practical scenarios, current theoretical analysis of KL-regularized RLHF still obtains the same $\mathcal{O}(1 / \epsilon^2)$ sample complexity as problems without KL-regularization. To understand the fundamental distinction between policy learning objectives with KL-regularization and ones without KL-regularization, we are the first to theoretically demonstrate the power of KL-regularization by providing a sharp analysis for KL-regularized contextual bandits and RLHF, revealing an $\mathcal{O}(1 / \epsilon)$ sample complexity when $\epsilon$ is sufficiently small. We further explore the role of data coverage in contextual bandits and RLHF. While the coverage assumption is commonly employed in offline RLHF to link the samples from the reference policy to the optimal policy, often at the cost of a multiplicative dependence on the coverage coefficient, its impact on the sample complexity of online RLHF remains unclear. Previous theoretical analyses of online RLHF typically require explicit exploration and additional structural assumptions on the reward function class. In contrast, we show that with sufficient coverage from the reference policy, a simple two-stage mixed sampling strategy can achieve a sample complexity with only an additive dependence on the coverage coefficient. Our results provide a comprehensive understanding of the roles of KL-regularization and data coverage in RLHF, shedding light on the design of more efficient RLHF algorithms.</p></details> |  |
| **[SALSA: Soup-based Alignment Learning for Stronger Adaptation in RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01798v1)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In Large Language Model (LLM) development, Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is crucial for aligning models with human values and preferences. RLHF traditionally relies on the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the current policy and a frozen initial policy as a reference, which is added as a penalty in policy optimization algorithms like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). While this constraint prevents models from deviating too far from the initial checkpoint, it limits exploration of the reward landscape, reducing the model's ability to discover higher-quality solutions. As a result, policy optimization is often trapped in a narrow region of the parameter space, leading to suboptimal alignment and performance. This paper presents SALSA (Soup-based Alignment Learning for Stronger Adaptation), a novel approach designed to overcome these limitations by creating a more flexible and better located reference model through weight-space averaging of two independent supervised fine-tuned (SFT) models. This model soup allows for larger deviation in KL divergence and exploring a promising region of the solution space without sacrificing stability. By leveraging this more robust reference model, SALSA fosters better exploration, achieving higher rewards and improving model robustness, out-of-distribution generalization, and performance. We validate the effectiveness of SALSA through extensive experiments on popular open models (Llama2-7B, Mistral-7B, and Gemma-2B) across various benchmarks (MT-Bench, Arena-Hard, UltraFeedback), where it consistently surpasses PPO by fostering deeper exploration and achieving superior alignment in LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[InfoRM: Mitigating Reward Hacking in RLHF via Information-Theoretic Reward Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09345v5)** | 2024-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the success of reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) in aligning language models with human values, reward hacking, also termed reward overoptimization, remains a critical challenge. This issue primarily arises from reward misgeneralization, where reward models (RMs) compute reward using spurious features that are irrelevant to human preferences. In this work, we tackle this problem from an information-theoretic perspective and propose a framework for reward modeling, namely InfoRM, by introducing a variational information bottleneck objective to filter out irrelevant information. Notably, we further identify a correlation between overoptimization and outliers in the IB latent space of InfoRM, establishing it as a promising tool for detecting reward overoptimization. Inspired by this finding, we propose the Cluster Separation Index (CSI), which quantifies deviations in the IB latent space, as an indicator of reward overoptimization to facilitate the development of online mitigation strategies. Extensive experiments on a wide range of settings and RM scales (70M, 440M, 1.4B, and 7B) demonstrate the effectiveness of InfoRM. Further analyses reveal that InfoRM's overoptimization detection mechanism is not only effective but also robust across a broad range of datasets, signifying a notable advancement in the field of RLHF. The code will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper has been accepted by NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |
| **[Towards Reliable Alignment: Uncertainty-aware RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23726v1)** | 2024-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in aligning Large Language Models with human preferences have benefited from larger reward models and better preference data. However, most of these methodologies rely on the accuracy of the reward model. The reward models used in Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) are typically learned from small datasets using stochastic optimization algorithms, making them prone to high variability. We illustrate the inconsistencies between reward models empirically on numerous open-source datasets. We theoretically show that the fluctuation of the reward models can be detrimental to the alignment problem because the derived policies are more overfitted to the reward model and, hence, are riskier if the reward model itself is uncertain. We use concentration of measure to motivate an uncertainty-aware, conservative algorithm for policy optimization. We show that such policies are more risk-averse in the sense that they are more cautious of uncertain rewards. We theoretically prove that our proposed methodology has less risk than the vanilla method. We corroborate our theoretical results with experiments based on designing an ensemble of reward models. We use this ensemble of reward models to align a language model using our methodology and observe that our empirical findings match our theoretical predictions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reward Difference Optimization For Sample Reweighting In Offline RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09385v2)** | 2024-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), aligning LLMs with human preferences become increasingly important. Although Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) proves effective, it is complicated and highly resource-intensive. As such, offline RLHF has been introduced as an alternative solution, which directly optimizes LLMs with ranking losses on a fixed preference dataset. Current offline RLHF only captures the "ordinal relationship" between responses, overlooking the crucial aspect of how much one is preferred over the others. To address this issue, we propose a simple yet effective solution called Reward Difference Optimization, shorted as RDO. Specifically, we introduce reward difference coefficients to reweigh sample pairs in offline RLHF. We then develop a difference model which captures rich interactions between a pair of responses for predicting these difference coefficients. Experiments with 7B LLMs on the HH and TL;DR datasets substantiate the effectiveness of our method in both automatic metrics and human evaluation, thereby highlighting its potential for aligning LLMs with human intent and values</p></details> | EMNLP 2024 findings |
| **[Measuring memorization in RLHF for code completion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11715v2)** | 2024-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) has become the dominant method to align large models to user preferences. Unlike fine-tuning, for which there are many studies regarding training data memorization, it is not clear how memorization is affected by or introduced in the RLHF alignment process. Understanding this relationship is important as real user data may be collected and used to align large models; if user data is memorized during RLHF and later regurgitated, this could raise privacy concerns. In addition to RLHF, other methods such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and $\Psi$PO have gained popularity for learning directly from human preferences, removing the need for optimizing intermediary reward models with reinforcement learning. In this work, we analyze how training data memorization can surface and propagate through each phase of RLHF and direct preference learning. We focus our study on code completion models, as code completion is one of the most popular use cases for large language models. We find that RLHF significantly decreases the chance that data used for reward modeling and reinforcement learning is memorized in comparison to directly fine-tuning on this data, but that examples already memorized during the fine-tuning stage of RLHF, will, in the majority of cases, remain memorized after RLHF. In contrast, we find that aligning by learning directly from human preference data via a special case of $\Psi$PO, Identity Preference Optimization (IPO), increases the likelihood that training data is regurgitated compared to RLHF. Our work suggests that RLHF, as opposed to direct preference learning, is a safer way to mitigate the risk of regurgitating sensitive preference data when aligning large language models. We find our conclusions are robust across multiple code completion datasets, tasks, and model scales.</p></details> |  |

Among reasoning tasks, multi-step reasoning poses a particular challenge. Grounded in the theory of formal logic, we have developed an automated method, Multi-step Deduction (MuseD), for deductive reasoning data. MuseD has allowed us to create training and testing datasets for multi-step reasoning. Our generation method enables control over the complexity of the generated instructions, facilitating training and evaluation of models across different difficulty levels. Through RLHF training, our training data has demonstrated significant improvements in logical capabilities for both in-domain of out-of-domain reasoning tasks. Additionally, we have conducted tests to assess the multi-step reasoning abilities of various models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Asynchronous RLHF: Faster and More Efficient Off-Policy RL for Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18252v1)** | 2024-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The dominant paradigm for RLHF is online and on-policy RL: synchronously generating from the large language model (LLM) policy, labelling with a reward model, and learning using feedback on the LLM's own outputs. While performant, this paradigm is computationally inefficient. Inspired by classical deep RL literature, we propose separating generation and learning in RLHF. This enables asynchronous generation of new samples while simultaneously training on old samples, leading to faster training and more compute-optimal scaling. However, asynchronous training relies on an underexplored regime, online but off-policy RLHF: learning on samples from previous iterations of our model. To understand the challenges in this regime, we investigate a fundamental question: how much off-policyness can we tolerate for asynchronous training to speed up learning but maintain performance? Among several RLHF algorithms we tested, we find that online DPO is most robust to off-policy data, and robustness increases with the scale of the policy model. We study further compute optimizations for asynchronous RLHF but find that they come at a performance cost, giving rise to a trade-off. Finally, we verify the scalability of asynchronous RLHF by training LLaMA 3.1 8B on an instruction-following task 40% faster than a synchronous run while matching final performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>code ...</summary><p>code at https://github.com/mnoukhov/async_rlhf</p></details> |
| **[Optimal Design for Reward Modeling in RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17055v2)** | 2024-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has become a popular approach to align language models (LMs) with human preferences. This method involves collecting a large dataset of human pairwise preferences across various text generations and using it to infer (implicitly or explicitly) a reward model. Numerous methods have been proposed to learn the reward model and align a LM with it. However, the costly process of collecting human preferences has received little attention and could benefit from theoretical insights. This paper addresses this issue and aims to formalize the reward training model in RLHF. We frame the selection of an effective dataset as a simple regret minimization task, using a linear contextual dueling bandit method. Given the potentially large number of arms, this approach is more coherent than the best-arm identification setting. We then propose an offline framework for solving this problem. Under appropriate assumptions - linearity of the reward model in the embedding space, and boundedness of the reward parameter - we derive bounds on the simple regret. Finally, we provide a lower bound that matches our upper bound up to constant and logarithmic terms. To our knowledge, this is the first theoretical contribution in this area to provide an offline approach as well as worst-case guarantees.</p></details> |  |
| **[How to Evaluate Reward Models for RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14872v2)** | 2024-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a new benchmark for reward models that quantifies their ability to produce strong language models through RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback). The gold-standard approach is to run a full RLHF training pipeline and directly probe downstream LLM performance. However, this process is prohibitively expensive. To address this, we build a predictive model of downstream LLM performance by evaluating the reward model on proxy tasks. These proxy tasks consist of a large-scale human preference and a verifiable correctness preference dataset, in which we measure 12 metrics across 12 domains. To investigate which reward model metrics are most correlated to gold-standard RLHF outcomes, we launch an end-to-end RLHF experiment on a large-scale crowdsourced human preference platform to view real reward model downstream performance as ground truth. Ultimately, we compile our data and findings into Preference Proxy Evaluations (PPE), the first reward model benchmark explicitly linked to post-RLHF real-world human preference performance, which we open-source for public use and further development. Our code and evaluations can be found at https://github.com/lmarena/PPE .</p></details> |  |

| **[On The Global Convergence Of Online RLHF With Neural Parametrization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15610v1)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The importance of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values cannot be overstated. RLHF is a three-stage process that includes supervised fine-tuning (SFT), reward learning, and policy learning. Although there are several offline and online approaches to aligning LLMs, they often suffer from distribution shift issues. These issues arise from the inability to accurately capture the distributional interdependence between the reward learning and policy learning stages. Consequently, this has led to various approximated approaches, but the theoretical insights and motivations remain largely limited to tabular settings, which do not hold in practice. This gap between theoretical insights and practical implementations is critical. It is challenging to address this gap as it requires analyzing the performance of AI alignment algorithms in neural network-parameterized settings. Although bi-level formulations have shown promise in addressing distribution shift issues, they suffer from the hyper-gradient problem, and current approaches lack efficient algorithms to solve this. In this work, we tackle these challenges employing the bi-level formulation laid out in Kwon et al. (2024) along with the assumption \emph{Weak Gradient Domination} to demonstrate convergence in an RLHF setup, obtaining a sample complexity of $\epsilon^{-\frac{7}{2}}$ . Our key contributions are twofold: (i) We propose a bi-level formulation for AI alignment in parameterized settings and introduce a first-order approach to solve this problem. (ii) We analyze the theoretical convergence rates of the proposed algorithm and derive state-of-the-art bounds. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to establish convergence rate bounds and global optimality for the RLHF framework in neural network-parameterized settings.</p></details> |  |

This misalignment often results in noticeable distortions and artifacts that cause speech enhancement to be ineffective. To address these issues, we propose a reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) framework to fine-tune an existing speech enhancement approach by optimizing performance using a mean-opinion score (MOS)-based reward model. Our results show that the RLHF-finetuned model has the best performance across different benchmarks for both objective and MOS-based speech quality assessment metrics on the Voicebank+DEMAND dataset. Through ablation studies, we show that both policy gradient loss and supervised MSE loss are important for balanced optimization across the different metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICASSP 2025</p></details> |
| **[Reward-Robust RLHF in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15360v3)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to progress toward more advanced forms of intelligence, Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is increasingly seen as a key pathway toward achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). However, the reliance on reward-model-based (RM-based) alignment methods introduces significant challenges due to the inherent instability and imperfections of Reward Models (RMs), which can lead to critical issues such as reward hacking and misalignment with human intentions. In this paper, we introduce a reward-robust RLHF framework aimed at addressing these fundamental challenges, paving the way for more reliable and resilient learning in LLMs. Our approach introduces a novel optimization objective that carefully balances performance and robustness by incorporating Bayesian Reward Model Ensembles (BRME) to model the uncertainty set of reward functions. This allows the framework to integrate both nominal performance and minimum reward signals, ensuring more stable learning even with imperfect RMs. Empirical results demonstrate that our framework consistently outperforms baselines across diverse benchmarks, showing improved accuracy and long-term stability. We also provide a theoretical analysis, demonstrating that reward-robust RLHF approaches the stability of constant reward settings, which proves to be acceptable even in a stochastic-case analysis. Together, these contributions highlight the framework potential to enhance both the performance and stability of LLM alignment.</p></details> |  |

This challenges the widely held belief that stronger reward models always lead to better language models, and opens up new avenues for future research into the key factors driving model performance and how to choose the most suitable reward models.

| **[An Adaptive Placement and Parallelism Framework for Accelerating RLHF Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11819v3)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, ChatGPT or InstructGPT like large language models (LLM) has made a significant impact in the AI world. Many works have attempted to reproduce the complex InstructGPT's training pipeline, namely Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF). However, the mainstream distributed RLHF training methods typically adopt a fixed model placement strategy, referred to as the Co-located strategy. This strategy treats all four interdependent models involved in RLHF as a single entity, distributing them across all devices and applying parallelism techniques designed for a single model, regardless of the workload heterogeneity inherent to each model. As a result, this strategy exacerbates the generation bottlenecks in the RLHF training and degrades the overall training efficiency. To address these issues, we propose a flexible model placement framework that offers two general and agile model placement strategies. The Interleaving strategy helps reduce memory redundancy and communication costs of RLHF training by placing models without dependencies on exclusive devices with careful orchestration. On the other hand, the Disaggregated strategy improves the throughput of model training by separating the training and inference runtime of the RLHF pipeline with additional shadow models. Furthermore, our framework provides a simple user interface and guidelines to easily and flexibly configure these strategies in various training scenarios. Our experiments have shown that our strategy can achieve notable improvements up to 11x, compared to the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches. The results highlight the effectiveness and adaptability of our methods in accelerating the training of distributed RLHF.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mitigating the Alignment Tax of RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06256v4)** | 2024-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs acquire a wide range of abilities during pre-training, but aligning LLMs under Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) can lead to forgetting pretrained abilities, which is also known as the alignment tax. To investigate alignment tax, we conducted experiments with existing RLHF algorithms using OpenLLaMA-3B, which revealed a pronounced alignment tax in NLP tasks. Whereas, despite various techniques to mitigate forgetting, they are often at odds with the RLHF performance, leading to a trade-off between alignment performance and forgetting mitigation, leading to an alignment-forgetting trade-off. In this paper we show that model averaging, which simply interpolates between pre and post RLHF model weights, surprisingly achieves the most strongest alignment-forgetting Pareto front among a wide range of competing methods. To understand its effectiveness, we offer theoretical insights into model averaging, revealing that it enhances performance Pareto front by increasing feature diversity on the layers where tasks share overlapped feature spaces. Empirical evidence corroborates our analysis by showing the benefits of averaging low-level transformer layers. Building on the analysis and the observation that averaging different layers of the transformer leads to significantly different alignment-forgetting trade-offs, we propose Heterogeneous Model Averaging (HMA) to Heterogeneously find various combination ratios of model layers. HMA seeks to maximize the alignment performance while incurring minimal alignment tax. Moreover, we validate HMA's performance across a range of RLHF algorithms over OpenLLaMA-3B and further extend our findings to Mistral-7B which is evaluated by open-sourced preference model and GPT4.

| **[Taming Overconfidence in LLMs: Reward Calibration in RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09724v1)** | 2024-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language model calibration refers to the alignment between the confidence of the model and the actual performance of its responses. While previous studies point out the overconfidence phenomenon in Large Language Models (LLMs) and show that LLMs trained with Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) are overconfident with a more sharpened output probability, in this study, we reveal that RLHF tends to lead models to express verbalized overconfidence in their own responses. We investigate the underlying cause of this overconfidence and demonstrate that reward models used for Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) exhibit inherent biases towards high-confidence scores regardless of the actual quality of responses. Building upon this insight, we propose two PPO variants: PPO-M: PPO with Calibrated Reward Modeling and PPO-C: PPO with Calibrated Reward Calculation. PPO-M integrates explicit confidence scores in reward model training, which calibrates reward models to better capture the alignment between response quality and verbalized confidence. PPO-C adjusts the reward score during PPO based on the difference between the current reward and the moving average of past rewards. Both PPO-M and PPO-C can be seamlessly integrated into the current PPO pipeline and do not require additional golden labels. We evaluate our methods on both Llama3-8B and Mistral-7B across six diverse datasets including multiple-choice and open-ended generation. Experiment results demonstrate that both of our methods can reduce calibration error and maintain performance comparable to standard PPO. We further show that they do not compromise model capabilities in open-ended conversation settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Regressing the Relative Future: Efficient Policy Optimization for Multi-turn RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04612v1)** | 2024-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success at tasks like summarization that involve a single turn of interaction. However, they can still struggle with multi-turn tasks like dialogue that require long-term planning. Previous works on multi-turn dialogue extend single-turn reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) methods to the multi-turn setting by treating all prior dialogue turns as a long context. Such approaches suffer from covariate shift: the conversations in the training set have previous turns generated by some reference policy, which means that low training error may not necessarily correspond to good performance when the learner is actually in the conversation loop. In response, we introduce REgressing the RELative FUture (REFUEL), an efficient policy optimization approach designed to address multi-turn RLHF in LLMs. REFUEL employs a single model to estimate $Q$-values and trains on self-generated data, addressing the covariate shift issue. REFUEL frames the multi-turn RLHF problem as a sequence of regression tasks on iteratively collected datasets, enabling ease of implementation. Theoretically, we prove that REFUEL can match the performance of any policy covered by the training set. Empirically, we evaluate our algorithm by using Llama-3.1-70B-it to simulate a user in conversation with our model. REFUEL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods such as DPO and REBEL across various settings. Furthermore, despite having only 8 billion parameters, Llama-3-8B-it fine-tuned with REFUEL outperforms Llama-3.1-70B-it on long multi-turn dialogues. Implementation of REFUEL can be found at https://github.com/ZhaolinGao/REFUEL/, and models trained by REFUEL can be found at https://huggingface.co/Cornell-AGI.</p></details> |  |
| **[WPO: Enhancing RLHF with Weighted Preference Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11827v2)** | 2024-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is a promising solution to align large language models (LLMs) more closely with human values. Off-policy preference optimization, where the preference data is obtained from other models, is widely adopted due to its cost efficiency and scalability. However, off-policy preference optimization often suffers from a distributional gap between the policy used for data collection and the target policy, leading to suboptimal optimization. In this paper, we propose a novel strategy to mitigate this problem by simulating on-policy learning with off-policy preference data. Our Weighted Preference Optimization (WPO) method adapts off-policy data to resemble on-policy data more closely by reweighting preference pairs according to their probability under the current policy. This method not only addresses the distributional gap problem but also enhances the optimization process without incurring additional costs. We validate our method on instruction following benchmarks including Alpaca Eval 2 and MT-bench. WPO not only outperforms Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) by up to 5.6% on Alpaca Eval 2 but also establishes a remarkable length-controlled winning rate against GPT-4-turbo of 76.7% based on Gemma-2-9b-it. We release the code and models at https://github.com/wzhouad/WPO.</p></details> | EMNLP 2024 |
| **[HybridFlow: A Flexible and Efficient RLHF Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19256v2)** | 2024-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is widely used in Large Language Model (LLM) alignment. Traditional RL can be modeled as a dataflow, where each node represents computation of a neural network (NN) and each edge denotes data dependencies between the NNs. RLHF complicates the dataflow by expanding each node into a distributed LLM training or generation program, and each edge into a many-to-many multicast. Traditional RL frameworks execute the dataflow using a single controller to instruct both intra-node computation and inter-node communication, which can be inefficient in RLHF due to large control dispatch overhead for distributed intra-node computation. Existing RLHF systems adopt a multi-controller paradigm, which can be inflexible due to nesting distributed computation and data communication. We propose HybridFlow, which combines single-controller and multi-controller paradigms in a hybrid manner to enable flexible representation and efficient execution of the RLHF dataflow. We carefully design a set of hierarchical APIs that decouple and encapsulate computation and data dependencies in the complex RLHF dataflow, allowing efficient operation orchestration to implement RLHF algorithms and flexible mapping of the computation onto various devices. We further design a 3D-HybridEngine for efficient actor model resharding between training and generation phases, with zero memory redundancy and significantly reduced communication overhead. Our experimental results demonstrate 1.53$\times$~20.57$\times$ throughput improvement when running various RLHF algorithms using HybridFlow, as compared with state-of-the-art baselines. HybridFlow source code will be available at https://github.com/volcengine/verl.</p></details> |  |
| **[UNA: Unifying Alignments of RLHF/PPO, DPO and KTO by a Generalized Implicit Reward Function](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15339v2)** | 2024-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An LLM is pretrained on trillions of tokens, but the pretrained LLM may still generate undesired responses. To solve this problem, alignment techniques such as RLHF, DPO and KTO are proposed. However, these alignment techniques have limitations. For example, RLHF requires training the reward model and policy separately, which is complex, time-consuming, memory intensive and unstable during training processes. DPO proposes a mapping between an optimal policy and a reward, greatly simplifying the training process of RLHF. However, it can not take full advantages of a reward model and it is limited to pairwise preference data. In this paper, we propose \textbf{UN}ified \textbf{A}lignment (UNA) which unifies RLHF/PPO, DPO and KTO. Firstly, we mathematically prove that given the classical RLHF objective, the optimal policy is induced by a generalize implicit reward function. With this novel mapping between a reward model and an optimal policy, UNA can 1. unify RLHF/PPO, DPO and KTO into a supervised learning of minimizing the difference between an implicit reward and an explicit reward; 2. outperform RLHF/PPO while simplify, stabilize, speed up and reduce memory burden of RL fine-tuning process; 3. accommodate different feedback types including pairwise, binary and scalar feedback. Downstream experiments show UNA outperforms DPO, KTO and RLHF.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Perfect Blend: Redefining RLHF with Mixture of Judges](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20370v1)** | 2024-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has become the leading approach for fine-tuning large language models (LLM). However, RLHF has limitations in multi-task learning (MTL) due to challenges of reward hacking and extreme multi-objective optimization (i.e., trade-off of multiple and/or sometimes conflicting objectives). Applying RLHF for MTL currently requires careful tuning of the weights for reward model and data combinations. This is often done via human intuition and does not generalize. In this work, we introduce a novel post-training paradigm which we called Constrained Generative Policy Optimization (CGPO). The core of CGPO is Mixture of Judges (MoJ) with cost-efficient constrained policy optimization with stratification, which can identify the perfect blend in RLHF in a principled manner. It shows strong empirical results with theoretical guarantees, does not require extensive hyper-parameter tuning, and is plug-and-play in common post-training pipelines. Together, this can detect and mitigate reward hacking behaviors while reaching a pareto-optimal point across an extremely large number of objectives. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that CGPO significantly outperforms standard RLHF algorithms like PPO and DPO across various tasks including general chat, STEM questions, instruction following, and coding. Specifically, CGPO shows improvements of 7.4% in AlpacaEval-2 (general chat), 12.5% in Arena-Hard (STEM & reasoning), and consistent gains in other domains like math and coding. Notably, PPO, while commonly used, is prone to severe reward hacking in popular coding benchmarks, which CGPO successfully addresses. This breakthrough in RLHF not only tackles reward hacking and extreme multi-objective optimization challenges but also advances the state-of-the-art in aligning general-purpose LLMs for diverse applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to conference</p></details> |
| **[RLHFuse: Efficient RLHF Training for Large Language Models with Inter- and Intra-Stage Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13221v2)** | 2024-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) enhances the alignment between LLMs and human preference. The workflow of RLHF typically involves several models and tasks in a series of distinct stages. Existing RLHF training systems view each task as the smallest execution unit thus overlooking the opportunities for subtask-level optimizations. Due to the intrinsic nature of RLHF training, i.e., the data skewness in the generation stage, and the pipeline bubbles in the training stage, existing RLHF systems suffer from low GPU utilization in production deployments. RLHFuse breaks the traditional view of RLHF workflow as a composition of individual tasks, splitting each task into finer-grained subtasks, and performing stage fusion to improve GPU utilization. RLHFuse contains two key ideas. First, for generation and inference tasks, RLHFuse splits them into sample-level subtasks, enabling efficient inter-stage fusion to mitigate the original generation bottleneck dominated by long-tailed samples. Second, for training tasks, RLHFuse breaks them into subtasks of micro-batches. By leveraging the intuition that pipeline execution can be essentially complemented by another pipeline, RLHFuse performs intra-stage fusion to concurrently execute these subtasks in the training stage with a fused pipeline schedule, resulting in fewer pipeline bubbles. In addition, RLHFuse incorporates a series of system optimizations tailored for each stage of RLHF, making it efficient and scalable for our internal product usage. We evaluate RLHFuse on various popular LLMs and the results show that RLHFuse increases the training throughput by up to 3.7x, compared to existing state-of-the-art systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantile Regression for Distributional Reward Models in RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10164v1)** | 2024-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has become a key method for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences through the use of reward models. However, traditional reward models typically generate point estimates, which oversimplify the diversity and complexity of human values and preferences. In this paper, we introduce Quantile Reward Models (QRMs), a novel approach to reward modeling that learns a distribution over rewards instead of a single scalar value. Our method uses quantile regression to estimate a full, potentially multimodal distribution over preferences, providing a more powerful and nuanced representation of preferences. This distributional approach can better capture the diversity of human values, addresses label noise, and accommodates conflicting preferences by modeling them as distinct modes in the distribution. Our experimental results show that QRM outperforms comparable traditional point-estimate models on RewardBench. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the additional information provided by the distributional estimates can be utilized in downstream applications, such as risk-aware reinforcement learning, resulting in LLM policies that generate fewer extremely negative responses. Our code and model are released at https://github.com/Nicolinho/QRM.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Data-Centric RLHF: Simple Metrics for Preference Dataset Comparison](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09603v1)** | 2024-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The goal of aligning language models to human preferences requires data that reveal these preferences. Ideally, time and money can be spent carefully collecting and tailoring bespoke preference data to each downstream application. However, in practice, a select few publicly available preference datasets are often used to train reward models for reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). While new preference datasets are being introduced with increasing frequency, there are currently no existing efforts to measure and compare these datasets. In this paper, we systematically study preference datasets through three perspectives: scale, label noise, and information content. We propose specific metrics for each of these perspectives and uncover different axes of comparison for a better understanding of preference datasets. Our work is a first step towards a data-centric approach to alignment by providing perspectives that aid in training efficiency and iterative data collection for RLHF.</p></details> | Working Paper |
| **[Reward Generalization in RLHF: A Topological Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10184v6)** | 2024-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing alignment methods share a common topology of information flow, where reward information is collected from humans, modeled with preference learning, and used to tune language models. However, this shared topology has not been systematically characterized, nor have its alternatives been thoroughly explored, leaving the problems of low data efficiency and unreliable generalization unaddressed. As a solution, we introduce a theoretical framework for investigating reward generalization in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), focusing on the topology of information flow at both macro and micro levels. At the macro level, we portray the RLHF information flow as an autoencoding process over behavior distributions, formalizing the RLHF objective of distributional consistency between human preference and model behavior. At the micro level, we present induced Bayesian networks as a theory of reward generalization in RLHF, introducing fine-grained dataset topologies into generalization bounds. Combining analysis on both levels, we propose reward modeling from tree-structured preference information. It is shown to reduce reward uncertainty by up to $\Theta(\log n/\log\log n)$ times compared to baselines, where $n$ is the dataset size. Validation on three NLP tasks shows that our tree-based reward model achieves an average win rate of 65% against baseline methods, thus improving reward generalization for free via topology design.</p></details> |  |

RL from AI Feedback (RLAIF), introduced in Bai et al., offers a promising alternative that trains the reward model (RM) on preferences generated by an off-the-shelf LLM. Across the tasks of summarization, helpful dialogue generation, and harmless dialogue generation, we show that RLAIF achieves comparable performance to RLHF. Furthermore, we take a step towards "self-improvement" by demonstrating that RLAIF can outperform a supervised fine-tuned baseline even when the AI labeler is the same size as the policy, or even the exact same checkpoint as the initial policy. Finally, we introduce direct-RLAIF (d-RLAIF) - a technique that circumvents RM training by obtaining rewards directly from an off-the-shelf LLM during RL, which achieves superior performance to canonical RLAIF. Our results suggest that RLAIF can achieve performance on-par with using human feedback, offering a potential solution to the scalability limitations of RLHF.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at ICML 2024</p></details> |
| **[Sequence to Sequence Reward Modeling: Improving RLHF by Language Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00162v1)** | 2024-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aligning the behavior of Large language models (LLMs) with human intentions and values remains a critical challenge. Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) aligns LLMs by training a reward model (RM) on human preferences and fine-tuning the LLMs to maximize RM feedback. Despite its effectiveness and popularity, RLHF is prone to biased local optimization. It means RM fails to provide feedback that accurately aligns with human preference, causing LLMs to explore unexpected generalizations, and failing to achieve alignment objectives. To mitigate this issue, we propose a novel \textit{sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) reward modeling} method. Its key insight is that learning from language feedback rather than scalar feedback improves RLHF without additional annotations. We replaced the reward modeling target from binary maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) with sequence MLE. This method enables richer and fine-grained language feedback without additional annotations, models, or training stages. Our experiments demonstrated its effectiveness, specifically, reducing the refusal-to-response paradigm in single-turn safety dialogues and the long-response bias in text summarization tasks. We provide further analysis that seq2seq RM improves RLHF performance across 2B and 7B LLMs on 3 NLP tasks, achieving an average win rate of 76.9\%. We further show that seq2seq RM can still improve the performance of RLHF under out-of-distribution prompts.</p></details> | 7 pages |
| **[Best-of-Venom: Attacking RLHF by Injecting Poisoned Preference Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05530v2)** | 2024-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is a popular method for aligning Language Models (LM) with human values and preferences. RLHF requires a large number of preference pairs as training data, which are often used in both the Supervised Fine-Tuning and Reward Model training and therefore publicly available datasets are commonly used. In this work, we study to what extent a malicious actor can manipulate the LMs generations by poisoning the preferences, i.e., injecting poisonous preference pairs into these datasets and the RLHF training process. We propose strategies to build poisonous preference pairs and test their performance by poisoning two widely used preference datasets. Our results show that preference poisoning is highly effective: injecting a small amount of poisonous data (1-5\% of the original dataset), we can effectively manipulate the LM to generate a target entity in a target sentiment (positive or negative). The findings from our experiments also shed light on strategies to defend against the preference poisoning attack.</p></details> |  |
| **[DPO Meets PPO: Reinforced Token Optimization for RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18922v2)** | 2024-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the classical Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) framework, Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is employed to learn from sparse, sentence-level rewards -- a challenging scenario in traditional deep reinforcement learning. Despite the great successes of PPO in the alignment of state-of-the-art closed-source large language models (LLMs), its open-source implementation is still largely sub-optimal, as widely reported by numerous research studies. To address these issues, we introduce a framework that models RLHF problems as a Markov decision process (MDP), enabling the capture of fine-grained token-wise information. Furthermore, we provide theoretical insights that demonstrate the superiority of our MDP framework over the previous sentence-level bandit formulation. Under this framework, we introduce an algorithm, dubbed as Reinforced Token Optimization (\texttt{RTO}), which learns the token-wise reward function from preference data and performs policy optimization based on this learned token-wise reward signal. Theoretically, \texttt{RTO} is proven to have the capability of finding the near-optimal policy sample-efficiently. For its practical implementation, \texttt{RTO} innovatively integrates Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and PPO. DPO, originally derived from sparse sentence rewards, surprisingly provides us with a token-wise characterization of response quality, which is seamlessly incorporated into our subsequent PPO training stage. Extensive real-world alignment experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploration-Driven Policy Optimization in RLHF: Theoretical Insights on Efficient Data Utilization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10342v2)** | 2024-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has achieved impressive empirical successes while relying on a small amount of human feedback. However, there is limited theoretical justification for this phenomenon. Additionally, most recent studies focus on value-based algorithms despite the recent empirical successes of policy-based algorithms. In this work, we consider an RLHF algorithm based on policy optimization (PO-RLHF). The algorithm is based on the popular Policy Cover-Policy Gradient (PC-PG) algorithm, which assumes knowledge of the reward function. In PO-RLHF, knowledge of the reward function is not assumed, and the algorithm uses trajectory-based comparison feedback to infer the reward function. We provide performance bounds for PO-RLHF with low query complexity, which provides insight into why a small amount of human feedback may be sufficient to achieve good performance with RLHF. A key novelty is a trajectory-level elliptical potential analysis, which bounds the reward estimation error when comparison feedback (rather than numerical reward observation) is given. We provide and analyze algorithms PG-RLHF and NN-PG-RLHF for two settings: linear and neural function approximation, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Long Way to Go: Investigating Length Correlations in RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03716v2)** | 2024-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Great success has been reported using Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) to align large language models, with open preference datasets enabling wider experimentation, particularly for "helpfulness" in tasks like dialogue and web question answering. Alongside these improvements, however, RLHF also often drives models to produce longer outputs. This paper demonstrates, on three diverse settings, that optimizing for response length is, much more than previously thought, a significant factor behind RLHF. Studying the strategies RL optimization uses to maximize reward, we find improvements in reward to largely be driven by increasing response length, instead of other features. Indeed, we find that even a purely length-based reward reproduces most downstream RLHF improvements over supervised fine-tuned models. Testing a comprehensive set of length-countering interventions, we identify the dominant source of these biases to be reward models, which, by studying training dynamics, we find are non-robust and easily influenced by length biases in preference data.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 13 figures, Accepted to COLM 2024</p></details> |

By enabling stable and reliable structural learning from fewer samples, Proto-RM significantly enhances LLMs' adaptability and accuracy in interpreting human preferences. Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate that Proto-RM significantly improves the performance of reward models and LLMs in human feedback tasks, achieving comparable and usually better results than traditional methods, while requiring significantly less data. in data-limited scenarios. This research offers a promising direction for enhancing the efficiency of reward models and optimizing the fine-tuning of language models under restricted feedback conditions.</p></details> | Accepted by ACL 2024 |

Depending on the availability of preference data, both online and offline RLHF are active areas of investigation. A key bottleneck is understanding how to incorporate uncertainty estimation in the reward function learned from the preference data for RLHF, regardless of how the preference data is collected. While the principles of optimism or pessimism under uncertainty are well-established in standard reinforcement learning (RL), a practically-implementable and theoretically-grounded form amenable to large language models is not yet available, as standard techniques for constructing confidence intervals become intractable under arbitrary policy parameterizations. In this paper, we introduce a unified approach to online and offline RLHF -- value-incentivized preference optimization (VPO) -- which regularizes the maximum-likelihood estimate of the reward function with the corresponding value function, modulated by a $\textit{sign}$ to indicate whether the optimism or pessimism is chosen. VPO also directly optimizes the policy with implicit reward modeling, and therefore shares a simpler RLHF pipeline similar to direct preference optimization. Theoretical guarantees of VPO are provided for both online and offline settings, matching the rates of their standard RL counterparts. Moreover, experiments on text summarization and dialog verify the practicality and effectiveness of VPO.</p></details> |  |

Since RLHF involves diverse computational workloads and intricate dependencies among multiple LLMs, directly adopting parallelization techniques from supervised training can result in sub-optimal performance. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel approach named parameter ReaLlocation, which dynamically redistributes LLM parameters in the cluster and adapts parallelization strategies during training. Building upon this idea, we introduce ReaLHF, a pioneering system capable of automatically discovering and running efficient execution plans for RLHF training given the desired algorithmic and hardware configurations. ReaLHF formulates the execution plan for RLHF as an augmented dataflow graph. Based on this formulation, ReaLHF employs a tailored search algorithm with a lightweight cost estimator to discover an efficient execution plan. Subsequently, the runtime engine deploys the selected plan by effectively parallelizing computations and redistributing parameters. We evaluate ReaLHF on the LLaMA-2 models with up to $4\times70$ billion parameters and 128 GPUs. The experiment results showcase ReaLHF's substantial speedups of $2.0-10.6\times$ compared to baselines. Furthermore, the execution plans generated by ReaLHF exhibit an average of $26\%$ performance improvement over heuristic approaches based on Megatron-LM. The source code of ReaLHF is publicly available at https://github.com/openpsi-project/ReaLHF .</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages (15 pages with references), 13 figures</p></details> |
| **[It Takes Two: On the Seamlessness between Reward and Policy Model in RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07971v2)** | 2024-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) involves training policy models (PMs) and reward models (RMs) to align language models with human preferences. Instead of focusing solely on PMs and RMs independently, we propose to examine their interactions during fine-tuning, introducing the concept of seamlessness. Our study starts with observing the saturation phenomenon, where continual improvements in RM and PM do not translate into RLHF progress. Our analysis shows that RMs fail to assign proper scores to PM responses, resulting in a 35% mismatch rate with human preferences, highlighting a significant discrepancy between PM and RM. To measure seamlessness between PM and RM without human effort, we propose an automatic metric, SEAM. SEAM quantifies the discrepancies between PM and RM judgments induced by data samples. We validate the effectiveness of SEAM in data selection and model augmentation. Our experiments demonstrate that (1) using SEAM-filtered data for RL training improves RLHF performance by 4.5%, and (2) SEAM-guided model augmentation results in a 4% performance improvement over standard augmentation methods.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents a novel two-step Coarse-to-Fine Actor model to address the inherent limitations in conversational and analytical capabilities of small-sized LLMs. Our approach begins with the Policy-based Coarse Actor, employing a technique we term "Continuous Maximization". The Coarse Actor establishes an enhanced, knowledge-rich pool adept at aligning with human preference styles in analysis and reasoning. Through the RLHF process, it employs Continuous Maximization, a strategy that dynamically and adaptively extends the output length limit, enabling the generation of more detailed and analytical content. Subsequently, the Fine Actor refines this analytical content, addressing the generation of excessively redundant information from the Coarse Actor. We introduce a "Knowledge Residue Merger" approach, refining the content from the Coarse Actor and merging it with an existing Instruction model to improve quality, correctness, and reduce redundancies. We applied our methodology to the popular Mistral model, creating Mistral-C2F, which has demonstrated exceptional performance across 11 general language tasks and the MT-Bench Dialogue task, outperforming similar-scale models and even larger models with 13B and 30B parameters. Our model has significantly improved conversational and analytical reasoning abilities.</p></details> |  |

Current autonomous driving methods typically utilize either human feedback in machine learning, including RL, or LLMs. Most feedback guides the car agent's learning process (e.g., controlling the car). RLHF is usually applied in the fine-tuning step, requiring direct human "preferences," which are not commonly used in optimizing autonomous driving models. In this research, we innovatively combine RLHF and LLMs to enhance autonomous driving safety. Training a model with human guidance from scratch is inefficient. Our framework starts with a pre-trained autonomous car agent model and implements multiple human-controlled agents, such as cars and pedestrians, to simulate real-life road environments. The autonomous car model is not directly controlled by humans. We integrate both physical and physiological feedback to fine-tune the model, optimizing this process using LLMs. This multi-agent interactive environment ensures safe, realistic interactions before real-world application. Finally, we will validate our model using data gathered from real-life testbeds located in New Jersey and New York City.</p></details> |  |
| **[Active Preference Optimization for Sample Efficient RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10500v2)** | 2024-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is pivotal in aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences. Although aligned generative models have shown remarkable abilities in various tasks, their reliance on high-quality human preference data creates a costly bottleneck in the practical application of RLHF. One primary reason is that current methods rely on uniformly picking prompt-generation pairs from a dataset of prompt-generations, to collect human feedback, resulting in sub-optimal alignment under a constrained budget, which highlights the criticality of adaptive strategies in efficient alignment. Recent works [Mehta et al., 2023, Muldrew et al., 2024] have tried to address this problem by designing various heuristics based on generation uncertainty. However, either the assumptions in [Mehta et al., 2023] are restrictive, or [Muldrew et al., 2024] do not provide any rigorous theoretical guarantee. To address these, we reformulate RLHF within contextual preference bandit framework, treating prompts as contexts, and develop an active-learning algorithm, $\textit{Active Preference Optimization}$ ($\texttt{APO}$), which enhances model alignment by querying preference data from the most important samples, achieving superior performance for small sample budget. We analyze the theoretical performance guarantees of $\texttt{APO}$ under the BTL preference model showing that the suboptimality gap of the policy learned via $\texttt{APO}$ scales as $O(1/\sqrt{T})$ for a budget of $T$. We also show that collecting preference data by choosing prompts randomly leads to a policy that suffers a constant sub-optimality. We perform detailed experimental evaluations on practical preference datasets to validate $\texttt{APO}$'s efficacy over the existing methods, establishing it as a sample-efficient and practical solution of alignment in a cost-effective and scalable manner.</p></details> | <details><summary>New e...</summary><p>New experimental results added.

However, their applications have been restricted to the supervised learning setting, where static objective functions with benign structures are considered. But bilevel problems such as incentive design, inverse reinforcement learning (RL), and RL from human feedback (RLHF) are often modeled as dynamic objective functions that go beyond the simple static objective structures, which pose significant challenges of using existing bilevel solutions. To tackle this new class of bilevel problems, we introduce the first principled algorithmic framework for solving bilevel RL problems through the lens of penalty formulation. We provide theoretical studies of the problem landscape and its penalty-based (policy) gradient algorithms. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms via simulations in the Stackelberg Markov game, RL from human feedback and incentive design.</p></details> | <details><summary>Short...</summary><p>Shorter version accepted to ICML 2024</p></details> |

We consider online exploration in RLHF, which exploits interactive access to human or AI feedback by deliberately encouraging the model to produce diverse, maximally informative responses. By allowing RLHF to confidently stray from the pre-trained model, online exploration offers the possibility of novel, potentially super-human capabilities, but its full potential as a paradigm for language model training has yet to be realized, owing to computational and statistical bottlenecks in directly adapting existing reinforcement learning techniques. We propose a new algorithm for online exploration in RLHF, Exploratory Preference Optimization (XPO), which is simple and practical -- a one-line change to (online) Direct Preference Optimization (DPO; Rafailov et al., 2023) -- yet enjoys the strongest known provable guarantees and promising empirical performance. XPO augments the DPO objective with a novel and principled exploration bonus, empowering the algorithm to explore outside the support of the initial model and human feedback data. In theory, we show that XPO is provably sample-efficient and converges to a near-optimal language model policy under natural exploration conditions, irrespective of whether the initial model has good coverage. Our analysis, which builds on the observation that DPO implicitly performs a form of $Q^{\star}$-approximation (or, Bellman error minimization), combines previously disparate techniques from language modeling and theoretical reinforcement learning in a serendipitous fashion through the perspective of KL-regularized Markov decision processes. Empirically, we find that XPO is more sample-efficient than non-exploratory DPO variants in a preliminary evaluation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Group Robust Preference Optimization in Reward-free RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20304v1)** | 2024-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adapting large language models (LLMs) for specific tasks usually involves fine-tuning through reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) on preference data. While these data often come from diverse labelers' groups (e.g., different demographics, ethnicities, company teams, etc.), traditional RLHF approaches adopt a "one-size-fits-all" approach, i.e., they indiscriminately assume and optimize a single preference model, thus not being robust to unique characteristics and needs of the various groups. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Group Robust Preference Optimization (GRPO) method to align LLMs to individual groups' preferences robustly. Our approach builds upon reward-free direct preference optimization methods, but unlike previous approaches, it seeks a robust policy which maximizes the worst-case group performance. To achieve this, GRPO adaptively and sequentially weights the importance of different groups, prioritizing groups with worse cumulative loss. We theoretically study the feasibility of GRPO and analyze its convergence for the log-linear policy class. By fine-tuning LLMs with GRPO using diverse group-based global opinion data, we significantly improved performance for the worst-performing groups, reduced loss imbalances across groups, and improved probability accuracies compared to non-robust baselines.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[RLHF from Heterogeneous Feedback via Personalization and Preference Aggregation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00254v2)** | 2024-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has been an effective technique for aligning AI systems with human values, with remarkable successes in fine-tuning large-language models recently. Most existing RLHF paradigms make the underlying assumption that human preferences are relatively homogeneous, and can be encoded by a single reward model. In this paper, we focus on addressing the issues due to the inherent heterogeneity in human preferences, as well as their potential strategic behavior in providing feedback. Specifically, we propose two frameworks to address heterogeneous human feedback in principled ways: personalization-based one and aggregation-based one. For the former, we propose two approaches based on representation learning and clustering, respectively, for learning multiple reward models that trades off the bias (due to preference heterogeneity) and variance (due to the use of fewer data for learning each model by personalization). We then establish sample complexity guarantees for both approaches. For the latter, we aim to adhere to the single-model framework, as already deployed in the current RLHF paradigm, by carefully aggregating diverse and truthful preferences from humans. We propose two approaches based on reward and preference aggregation, respectively: the former utilizes both utilitarianism and Leximin approaches to aggregate individual reward models, with sample complexity guarantees; the latter directly aggregates the human feedback in the form of probabilistic opinions. Under the probabilistic-opinion-feedback model, we also develop an approach to handle strategic human labelers who may bias and manipulate the aggregated preferences with untruthful feedback. Based on the ideas in mechanism design, our approach ensures truthful preference reporting, with the induced aggregation rule maximizing social welfare functions.</p></details> | Added experiments |
| **[On the Algorithmic Bias of Aligning Large Language Models with RLHF: Preference Collapse and Matching Regularization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16455v1)** | 2024-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences is crucial for informing fair, economically sound, and statistically efficient decision-making processes. However, we argue that reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) -- the predominant approach for aligning LLMs with human preferences through a reward model -- suffers from an inherent algorithmic bias due to its Kullback--Leibler-based regularization in optimization. In extreme cases, this bias could lead to a phenomenon we term preference collapse, where minority preferences are virtually disregarded. To mitigate this algorithmic bias, we introduce preference matching (PM) RLHF, a novel approach that provably aligns LLMs with the preference distribution of the reward model under the Bradley--Terry--Luce/Plackett--Luce model. Central to our approach is a PM regularizer that takes the form of the negative logarithm of the LLM's policy probability distribution over responses, which helps the LLM balance response diversification and reward maximization. Notably, we obtain this regularizer by solving an ordinary differential equation that is necessary for the PM property. For practical implementation, we introduce a conditional variant of PM RLHF that is tailored to natural language generation. Finally, we empirically validate the effectiveness of conditional PM RLHF through experiments on the OPT-1.3B and Llama-2-7B models, demonstrating a 29% to 41% improvement in alignment with human preferences, as measured by a certain metric, compared to standard RLHF.</p></details> |  |

We first identify the primary challenges of existing popular methods like offline PPO and offline DPO as lacking in strategical exploration of the environment. Then, to understand the mathematical principle of RLHF, we consider a standard mathematical formulation, the reverse-KL regularized contextual bandit for RLHF. Despite its widespread practical application, a rigorous theoretical analysis of this formulation remains open. We investigate its behavior in three distinct settings -- offline, online, and hybrid -- and propose efficient algorithms with finite-sample theoretical guarantees. Moving towards practical applications, our framework, with a robust approximation of the information-theoretical policy improvement oracle, naturally gives rise to several novel RLHF algorithms. This includes an iterative version of the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) algorithm for online settings, and a multi-step rejection sampling strategy for offline scenarios. Our empirical evaluations on real-world alignment experiment of large language model demonstrate that these proposed methods significantly surpass existing strong baselines, such as DPO and Rejection Sampling Optimization (RSO), showcasing the connections between solid theoretical foundations and their potent practical implementations.</p></details> | <details><summary>53 pa...</summary><p>53 pages; theoretical study and algorithmic design of iterative RLHF and DPO</p></details> |

The key to the strategy is learning a reward model ($\varphi$), which can reflect the latent reward model of humans. While this strategy has proven effective, the training methodology requires a lot of human preference annotation (usually in the order of tens of thousands) to train $\varphi$. Such a large-scale annotation is justifiable when it's a one-time effort, and the reward model is universally applicable. However, human goals are subjective and depend on the task, requiring task-specific preference annotations, which can be impractical to fulfill. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach to infuse domain knowledge into $\varphi$, which reduces the amount of preference annotation required ($21\times$), omits Alignment Tax, and provides some interpretability. We validate our approach in E-Commerce Opinion Summarization, with a significant reduction in dataset size (to just $940$ samples) while advancing the SOTA ($\sim4$ point ROUGE-L improvement, $68\%$ of times preferred by humans over SOTA). Our contributions include a novel Reward Modeling technique and two new datasets: PromptOpinSumm (supervised data for Opinion Summarization) and OpinPref (a gold-standard human preference dataset). The proposed methodology opens up avenues for efficient RLHF, making it more adaptable to applications with varying human values. We release the artifacts (Code: github.com/efficient-rlhf.

| **[Distributional Preference Learning: Understanding and Accounting for Hidden Context in RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08358v2)** | 2024-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In practice, preference learning from human feedback depends on incomplete data with hidden context. Hidden context refers to data that affects the feedback received, but which is not represented in the data used to train a preference model. This captures common issues of data collection, such as having human annotators with varied preferences, cognitive processes that result in seemingly irrational behavior, and combining data labeled according to different criteria. We prove that standard applications of preference learning, including reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), implicitly aggregate over hidden contexts according to a well-known voting rule called Borda count. We show this can produce counter-intuitive results that are very different from other methods which implicitly aggregate via expected utility. Furthermore, our analysis formalizes the way that preference learning from users with diverse values tacitly implements a social choice function. A key implication of this result is that annotators have an incentive to misreport their preferences in order to influence the learned model, leading to vulnerabilities in the deployment of RLHF. As a step towards mitigating these problems, we introduce a class of methods called distributional preference learning (DPL). DPL methods estimate a distribution of possible score values for each alternative in order to better account for hidden context. Experimental results indicate that applying DPL to RLHF for LLM chatbots identifies hidden context in the data and significantly reduces subsequent jailbreak vulnerability.

This framework often consists of two steps: learning a reward model from an offline preference dataset followed by running online RL to optimize the learned reward model. In this work, leveraging the idea of reset, we propose a new RLHF algorithm with provable guarantees. Motivated by the fact that offline preference dataset provides informative states (i.e., data that is preferred by the labelers), our new algorithm, Dataset Reset Policy Optimization (DR-PO), integrates the existing offline preference dataset into the online policy training procedure via dataset reset: it directly resets the policy optimizer to the states in the offline dataset, instead of always starting from the initial state distribution. In theory, we show that DR-PO learns to perform at least as good as any policy that is covered by the offline dataset under general function approximation with finite sample complexity. In experiments, we demonstrate that on both the TL;DR summarization and the Anthropic Helpful Harmful (HH) dataset, the generation from DR-PO is better than that from Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Direction Preference Optimization (DPO), under the metric of GPT4 win-rate.

However, training LLMs to serve as effective assistants for humans requires careful consideration. A promising approach is reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), which leverages human feedback to update the model in accordance with human preferences and mitigate issues like toxicity and hallucinations. Yet, an understanding of RLHF for LLMs is largely entangled with initial design choices that popularized the method and current research focuses on augmenting those choices rather than fundamentally improving the framework. In this paper, we analyze RLHF through the lens of reinforcement learning principles to develop an understanding of its fundamentals, dedicating substantial focus to the core component of RLHF -- the reward model. Our study investigates modeling choices, caveats of function approximation, and their implications on RLHF training algorithms, highlighting the underlying assumptions made about the expressivity of reward. Our analysis improves the understanding of the role of reward models and methods for their training, concurrently revealing limitations of the current methodology. We characterize these limitations, including incorrect generalization, model misspecification, and the sparsity of feedback, along with their impact on the performance of a language model. The discussion and analysis are substantiated by a categorical review of current literature, serving as a reference for researchers and practitioners to understand the challenges of RLHF and build upon existing efforts.</p></details> |  |

To reduce harmful outputs, produces and vendors of LLMs have used reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF). In tandem, LLM vendors have been increasingly enabling fine-tuning of their most powerful models. However, concurrent work has shown that fine-tuning can remove RLHF protections. We may expect that the most powerful models currently available (GPT-4) are less susceptible to fine-tuning attacks. In this work, we show the contrary: fine-tuning allows attackers to remove RLHF protections with as few as 340 examples and a 95% success rate. These training examples can be automatically generated with weaker models. We further show that removing RLHF protections does not decrease usefulness on non-censored outputs, providing evidence that our fine-tuning strategy does not decrease usefulness despite using weaker models to generate training data. Our results show the need for further research on protections on LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NAACL 2024. (7 pages)</p></details> |

| **[Balancing Enhancement, Harmlessness, and General Capabilities: Enhancing Conversational LLMs with Direct RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02513v1)** | 2024-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent advancements in Conversational Large Language Models (LLMs), a concerning trend has emerged, showing that many new base LLMs experience a knowledge reduction in their foundational capabilities following Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). This process often leads to issues such as forgetting or a decrease in the base model's abilities. Moreover, fine-tuned models struggle to align with user preferences, inadvertently increasing the generation of toxic outputs when specifically prompted. To overcome these challenges, we adopted an innovative approach by completely bypassing SFT and directly implementing Harmless Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). Our method not only preserves the base model's general capabilities but also significantly enhances its conversational abilities, while notably reducing the generation of toxic outputs. Our approach holds significant implications for fields that demand a nuanced understanding and generation of responses, such as customer service. We applied this methodology to Mistral, the most popular base model, thereby creating Mistral-Plus. Our validation across 11 general tasks demonstrates that Mistral-Plus outperforms similarly sized open-source base models and their corresponding instruct versions. Importantly, the conversational abilities of Mistral-Plus were significantly improved, indicating a substantial advancement over traditional SFT models in both safety and user preference alignment.</p></details> |  |

While there has been significant work developing these methods, our understanding of the benefits and downsides of each stage in RLHF is still limited. To fill this gap, we present an extensive analysis of how each stage of the process (i.e. supervised fine-tuning (SFT), reward modelling, and RLHF) affects two key properties: out-of-distribution (OOD) generalisation and output diversity. OOD generalisation is crucial given the wide range of real-world scenarios in which these models are being used, while output diversity refers to the model's ability to generate varied outputs and is important for a variety of use cases. We perform our analysis across two base models on both summarisation and instruction following tasks, the latter being highly relevant for current LLM use cases. We find that RLHF generalises better than SFT to new inputs, particularly as the distribution shift between train and test becomes larger. However, RLHF significantly reduces output diversity compared to SFT across a variety of measures, implying a tradeoff in current LLM fine-tuning methods between generalisation and diversity. Our results provide guidance on which fine-tuning method should be used depending on the application, and show that more research is needed to improve the tradeoff between generalisation and diversity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available here: https://github.com/facebookresearch/rlfh-gen-div</p></details> |

The same issue also holds for some reward models in RL. To address the challenges in both training and evaluation, we establish a more reliable evaluation protocol for comparing different training configurations, which inspects the trade-off between LLM evaluation score and response length obtained by varying training hyperparameters. Based on this evaluation, we conduct large-scale studies, where the results shed insights into the efficacy of hyperparameters and tricks used in RL on mitigating length bias. We further propose to improve the reward model by jointly training two linear heads on shared feature representations to predict the rewards, one trained to correlate with length, and the other trained to decorrelate with length and therefore focus more on the actual content. We then discard the length head in RL to prevent reward hacking on length. Experiments demonstrate that our approach almost eliminates the reward correlation with length, and improves the obtained policy by a significant margin.</p></details> |  |

The initial phase of RLHF involves learning human values using a reward model from ranking data. It is observed that the performance of the reward model degrades after one epoch of training, and optimizing too much against the learned reward model eventually hinders the true objective. This paper delves into these issues, leveraging the theoretical insights to design improved reward learning algorithm termed 'Iterative Data Smoothing' (IDS). The core idea is that during each training epoch, we not only update the model with the data, but also update the date using the model, replacing hard labels with soft labels. Our empirical findings highlight the superior performance of this approach over the traditional methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Secrets of RLHF in Large Language Models Part II: Reward Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06080v2)** | 2024-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has become a crucial technology for aligning language models with human values and intentions, enabling models to produce more helpful and harmless responses. Reward models are trained as proxies for human preferences to drive reinforcement learning optimization. While reward models are often considered central to achieving high performance, they face the following challenges in practical applications: (1) Incorrect and ambiguous preference pairs in the dataset may hinder the reward model from accurately capturing human intent. (2) Reward models trained on data from a specific distribution often struggle to generalize to examples outside that distribution and are not suitable for iterative RLHF training. In this report, we attempt to address these two issues. (1) From a data perspective, we propose a method to measure the strength of preferences within the data, based on a voting mechanism of multiple reward models. Experimental results confirm that data with varying preference strengths have different impacts on reward model performance. We introduce a series of novel methods to mitigate the influence of incorrect and ambiguous preferences in the dataset and fully leverage high-quality preference data. (2) From an algorithmic standpoint, we introduce contrastive learning to enhance the ability of reward models to distinguish between chosen and rejected responses, thereby improving model generalization. Furthermore, we employ meta-learning to enable the reward model to maintain the ability to differentiate subtle differences in out-of-distribution samples, and this approach can be utilized for iterative RLHF optimization.</p></details> |  |

Preferences arguably contain less information than rewards, which makes preference-based RL seemingly more difficult. This paper theoretically proves that, for a wide range of preference models, we can solve preference-based RL directly using existing algorithms and techniques for reward-based RL, with small or no extra costs. Specifically, (1) for preferences that are drawn from reward-based probabilistic models, we reduce the problem to robust reward-based RL that can tolerate small errors in rewards; (2) for general arbitrary preferences where the objective is to find the von Neumann winner, we reduce the problem to multiagent reward-based RL which finds Nash equilibria for factored Markov games with a restricted set of policies. The latter case can be further reduced to adversarial MDP when preferences only depend on the final state. We instantiate all reward-based RL subroutines by concrete provable algorithms, and apply our theory to a large class of models including tabular MDPs and MDPs with generic function approximation. We further provide guarantees when K-wise comparisons are available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation at NeurIPS 2023; 29 pages</p></details> |

However, the inherent tension between the objectives of helpfulness and harmlessness presents a significant challenge during LLM training. To address this issue, we propose Safe Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (Safe RLHF), a novel algorithm for human value alignment. Safe RLHF explicitly decouples human preferences regarding helpfulness and harmlessness, effectively avoiding the crowdworkers' confusion about the tension and allowing us to train separate reward and cost models. We formalize the safety concern of LLMs as an optimization task of maximizing the reward function while satisfying specified cost constraints. Leveraging the Lagrangian method to solve this constrained problem, Safe RLHF dynamically adjusts the balance between the two objectives during fine-tuning. Through a three-round fine-tuning using Safe RLHF, we demonstrate a superior ability to mitigate harmful responses while enhancing model performance compared to existing value-aligned algorithms. Experimentally, we fine-tuned the Alpaca-7B using Safe RLHF and aligned it with collected human preferences, significantly improving its helpfulness and harmlessness according to human evaluations.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we aim to link the research in conventional RL to RL techniques used in LLM research. Demystify this technique by discussing why, when, and how RL excels. Furthermore, we explore potential future avenues that could either benefit from or contribute to RLHF research. Highlighted Takeaways: 1. RLHF is Online Inverse RL with Offline Demonstration Data. 2. RLHF $>$ SFT because Imitation Learning (and Inverse RL) $>$ Behavior Cloning (BC) by alleviating the problem of compounding error. 3. The RM step in RLHF generates a proxy of the expensive human feedback, such an insight can be generalized to other LLM tasks such as prompting evaluation and optimization where feedback is also expensive. 4. The policy learning in RLHF is more challenging than conventional problems studied in IRL due to their high action dimensionality and feedback sparsity. 5. The main superiority of PPO over off-policy value-based methods is its stability gained from (almost) on-policy data and conservative policy updates.</p></details> |  |

It typically consists of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) stages. However, RLHF faces inherent limitations stemming from a complex training setup and its tendency to align the model with implicit values that end users cannot control at run-time. Moreover, reward models in RLHF stage commonly rely on single-dimensional feedback as opposed to explicit, multifaceted signals that indicate attributes such as helpfulness, humor, and toxicity. To address these limitations, we propose SteerLM, a supervised fine-tuning method that empowers end-users to control responses during inference. SteerLM conditions responses to conform to an explicitly defined multi-dimensional set of attributes, thereby empowering a steerable AI capable of generating helpful and high-quality responses while maintaining customizability. Experiments show that SteerLM trained on open source datasets generates responses that are preferred by human and automatic evaluators to many state-of-the-art baselines trained with RLHF while being much easier to train.

A notable subject that is understudied is the (in-)consistency of RMs -- whether they can recognize the semantic changes to different prompts and appropriately adapt their reward assignments -- and their impact on the downstream RLHF model. In this paper, we visit a series of research questions relevant to RM inconsistency: (1) How can we measure the consistency of reward models? (2) How consistent are the existing RMs and how can we improve them? (3) In what ways does reward inconsistency influence the chatbots resulting from the RLHF model training? We propose Contrast Instructions -- a benchmarking strategy for the consistency of RM. Each example in Contrast Instructions features a pair of lexically similar instructions with different ground truth responses. A consistent RM is expected to rank the corresponding instruction and response higher than other combinations. We observe that current RMs trained with the standard ranking objective fail miserably on Contrast Instructions compared to average humans. To show that RM consistency can be improved efficiently without using extra training budget, we propose two techniques ConvexDA and RewardFusion, which enhance reward consistency through extrapolation during the RM training and inference stage, respectively. We show that RLHF models trained with a more consistent RM yield more useful responses, suggesting that reward inconsistency exhibits a trickle-down effect on the downstream RLHF process.</p></details> |  |
| **[Aligning Large Multimodal Models with Factually Augmented RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14525v1)** | 2023-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Multimodal Models (LMM) are built across modalities and the misalignment between two modalities can result in "hallucination", generating textual outputs that are not grounded by the multimodal information in context. To address the multimodal misalignment issue, we adapt the Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) from the text domain to the task of vision-language alignment, where human annotators are asked to compare two responses and pinpoint the more hallucinated one, and the vision-language model is trained to maximize the simulated human rewards. We propose a new alignment algorithm called Factually Augmented RLHF that augments the reward model with additional factual information such as image captions and ground-truth multi-choice options, which alleviates the reward hacking phenomenon in RLHF and further improves the performance. We also enhance the GPT-4-generated training data (for vision instruction tuning) with previously available human-written image-text pairs to improve the general capabilities of our model. To evaluate the proposed approach in real-world scenarios, we develop a new evaluation benchmark MMHAL-BENCH with a special focus on penalizing hallucinations. As the first LMM trained with RLHF, our approach achieves remarkable improvement on the LLaVA-Bench dataset with the 94% performance level of the text-only GPT-4 (while previous best methods can only achieve the 87% level), and an improvement by 60% on MMHAL-BENCH over other baselines. We opensource our code, model, data at https://llava-rlhf.github.io.</p></details> | Preprint |

This challenge is characterized by various instabilities, such as reward hacking and catastrophic forgetting. In this technical report, we propose two innovations to stabilize RLHF training: 1) Advantage Model, which directly models advantage score i.e., extra reward compared to the expected rewards and regulates score distributions across tasks to prevent reward hacking. 2) Selective Rehearsal, which mitigates catastrophic forgetting by strategically selecting data for PPO training and knowledge rehearsing. Our experimental analysis on public and proprietary datasets reveals that the proposed methods not only increase stability in RLHF training but also achieve higher reward scores and win rates.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, working in progress</p></details> |

In this technical report, we empirically investigate an efficient implementation of RLHF using low-rank adaptation (LoRA), which allows us to align the LLaMA 7B checkpoint on the Alpaca dataset using only two A100 GPUs instead of the eight required for full model fine-tuning. Despite tuning only 0.2% of LLaMA 7B's parameters, our implementation achieves better performance than the publicly-released AlpacaFarm checkpoint with full model fine-tuning. Next, we analyze several configurations of our LoRA-based PPO implementation, varying the form of the KL regularization term in the training objective. We find that (1) removing this penalty term does not harm performance on the AlpacaFarm evaluation set under our LoRA setup; (2) other regularizers, such as Jensen-Shannon divergence, lead to improved performance; and (3) while PPO training negatively impacts the factuality of model-generated responses, training with LoRA largely mitigates this effect. We release our code and pretrained checkpoints to facilitate future research on more efficient RLHF.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient RLHF: Reducing the Memory Usage of PPO](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00754v1)** | 2023-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) has revolutionized language modeling by aligning models with human preferences. However, the RL stage, Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), requires over 3x the memory of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), making it infeasible to use for most practitioners. To address this issue, we present a comprehensive analysis the memory usage, performance, and training time of memory-savings techniques for PPO. We introduce Hydra-RLHF by first integrating the SFT and Reward models and then dynamically turning LoRA "off" during training. Our experiments show: 1. Using LoRA during PPO reduces its memory usage to be smaller than SFT while improving alignment across four public benchmarks, and 2. Hydra-PPO reduces the latency per sample of LoRA-PPO by up to 65% while maintaining its performance. Our results demonstrate that Hydra-PPO is a simple and promising solution for enabling more widespread usage of RLHF.</p></details> |  |

However, the current landscape lacks an accessible, efficient, and cost-effective end-to-end RLHF (Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback) training pipeline for these powerful models, particularly when training at the scale of billions of parameters. This paper introduces DeepSpeed-Chat, a novel system that democratizes RLHF training, making it accessible to the AI community. DeepSpeed-Chat offers three key capabilities: an easy-to-use training and inference experience for ChatGPT-like models, a DeepSpeed-RLHF pipeline that replicates the training pipeline from InstructGPT, and a robust DeepSpeed-RLHF system that combines various optimizations for training and inference in a unified way. The system delivers unparalleled efficiency and scalability, enabling training of models with hundreds of billions of parameters in record time and at a fraction of the cost. With this development, DeepSpeed-Chat paves the way for broader access to advanced RLHF training, even for data scientists with limited resources, thereby fostering innovation and further development in the field of AI.</p></details> | 14 pages, 7 figures |

Its primary objective is to function as a human-centric (helpful, honest, and harmless) assistant. Alignment with humans assumes paramount significance, and reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) emerges as the pivotal technological paradigm underpinning this pursuit. Current technical routes usually include \textbf{reward models} to measure human preferences, \textbf{Proximal Policy Optimization} (PPO) to optimize policy model outputs, and \textbf{process supervision} to improve step-by-step reasoning capabilities. However, due to the challenges of reward design, environment interaction, and agent training, coupled with huge trial and error cost of large language models, there is a significant barrier for AI researchers to motivate the development of technical alignment and safe landing of LLMs. The stable training of RLHF has still been a puzzle. In the first report, we dissect the framework of RLHF, re-evaluate the inner workings of PPO, and explore how the parts comprising PPO algorithms impact policy agent training. We identify policy constraints being the key factor for the effective implementation of the PPO algorithm. Therefore, we explore the PPO-max, an advanced version of PPO algorithm, to efficiently improve the training stability of the policy model. Based on our main results, we perform a comprehensive analysis of RLHF abilities compared with SFT models and ChatGPT. The absence of open-source implementations has posed significant challenges to the investigation of LLMs alignment. Therefore, we are eager to release technical reports, reward models and PPO codes, aiming to make modest contributions to the advancement of LLMs.</p></details> |  |

While substantial safety data exist in English, multilingual guardrail modeling remains underexplored due to the scarcity of open-source safety data in other languages. To address this gap, we propose a novel two-player Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework, where a generator and a guardrail model co-evolve adversarially to produce high-quality synthetic data for multilingual guardrail training. We theoretically formalize this interaction as a two-player game, proving convergence to a Nash equilibrium. Empirical evaluations show that our model \ours outperforms state-of-the-art models, achieving nearly 10% improvement over LlamaGuard3 (8B) on English benchmarks while being 4.5x faster at inference with a significantly smaller model (0.5B). We achieve substantial advancements in multilingual safety tasks, particularly in addressing the imbalance for lower-resource languages in a collected real dataset. Ablation studies emphasize the critical role of synthetic data generation in bridging the imbalance in open-source data between English and other languages. These findings establish a scalable and efficient approach to synthetic data generation, paving the way for improved multilingual guardrail models to enhance LLM safety. Code, model, and data will be open-sourced at https://github.com/yihedeng9/DuoGuard.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 9 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

Although methods like differential privacy or neuron editing can reduce memorization, they typically require costly retraining or direct access to model weights and may degrade performance. To address these challenges, we propose TokenSwap, a lightweight, post-hoc approach that replaces the probabilities of grammar-related tokens with those from a small auxiliary model (e.g., DistilGPT-2). We run extensive experiments on commercial grade models such as Pythia-6.9b and LLaMA-3-8b and demonstrate that our method effectively reduces well-known cases of memorized generation by upto 10x with little to no impact on downstream tasks. Our approach offers a uniquely accessible and effective solution to users of real-world systems.</p></details> | 20 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Simplicity Prevails: Rethinking Negative Preference Optimization for LLM Unlearning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07163v3)** | 2025-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work studies the problem of large language model (LLM) unlearning, aiming to remove unwanted data influences (e.g., copyrighted or harmful content) while preserving model utility. Despite the increasing demand for unlearning, a technically-grounded optimization framework is lacking. Gradient ascent (GA)-type methods, though widely used, are suboptimal as they reverse the learning process without controlling optimization divergence (i.e., deviation from the pre-trained state), leading to risks of over-forgetting and potential model collapse. Negative preference optimization (NPO) has been proposed to address this issue and is considered one of the state-of-the-art LLM unlearning approaches. In this work, we revisit NPO and identify another critical issue: reference model bias. This bias arises from using the reference model (i.e., the model prior to unlearning) to evaluate the unlearning success, which can compromise NPO's effectiveness. Specifically, it leads to (a) uneven allocation of optimization power across forget data with varying difficulty levels and (b) ineffective gradient weight smoothing during the early stages of unlearning optimization. To overcome these challenges, we propose a simple yet effective unlearning optimization framework, called SimNPO, showing that `simplicity' in removing the reliance on a reference model (through the lens of simple preference optimization) benefits unlearning. We provide deeper insights into SimNPO's advantages through an analysis based on mixtures of Markov chains. Extensive experiments further validate SimNPO's efficacy on benchmarks like TOFU and MUSE, as well as its robustness against relearning attacks. Codes are available at https://github.com/OPTML-Group/Unlearn-Simple.</p></details> |  |

We present Constituent-Aware Pooling (CAP), a methodology designed to analyse how LLMs process compositional linguistic structures. Grounded in principles of compositionality, mechanistic interpretability, and information theory, CAP systematically intervenes in model activations through constituent-based pooling at various model levels. Our experiments on inverse definition modelling, hypernym and synonym prediction reveal critical insights into transformers' limitations in handling compositional abstractions. No specific layer integrates tokens into unified semantic representations based on their constituent parts. We observe fragmented information processing, which intensifies with model size, suggesting that larger models struggle more with these interventions and exhibit greater information dispersion. This fragmentation likely stems from transformers' training objectives and architectural design, preventing systematic and cohesive representations. Our findings highlight fundamental limitations in current transformer architectures regarding compositional semantics processing and model interpretability, underscoring the critical need for novel approaches in LLM design to address these challenges.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 2 Figures, 12 tables</p></details> |
| **[GenBFA: An Evolutionary Optimization Approach to Bit-Flip Attacks on LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13757v2)** | 2025-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing (NLP), excelling in tasks like text generation and summarization. However, their increasing adoption in mission-critical applications raises concerns about hardware-based threats, particularly bit-flip attacks (BFAs). BFAs, enabled by fault injection methods such as Rowhammer, target model parameters in memory, compromising both integrity and performance. Identifying critical parameters for BFAs in the vast parameter space of LLMs poses significant challenges. While prior research suggests transformer-based architectures are inherently more robust to BFAs compared to traditional deep neural networks, we challenge this assumption. For the first time, we demonstrate that as few as three bit-flips can cause catastrophic performance degradation in an LLM with billions of parameters. Current BFA techniques are inadequate for exploiting this vulnerability due to the difficulty of efficiently identifying critical parameters within the immense parameter space. To address this, we propose AttentionBreaker, a novel framework tailored for LLMs that enables efficient traversal of the parameter space to identify critical parameters. Additionally, we introduce GenBFA, an evolutionary optimization strategy designed to refine the search further, isolating the most critical bits for an efficient and effective attack. Empirical results reveal the profound vulnerability of LLMs to AttentionBreaker. For example, merely three bit-flips (4.129 x 10^-9% of total parameters) in the LLaMA3-8B-Instruct 8-bit quantized (W8) model result in a complete performance collapse: accuracy on MMLU tasks drops from 67.3% to 0%, and Wikitext perplexity skyrockets from 12.6 to 4.72 x 10^5. These findings underscore the effectiveness of AttentionBreaker in uncovering and exploiting critical vulnerabilities within LLM architectures.</p></details> |  |
| **[QuEST: Stable Training of LLMs with 1-Bit Weights and Activations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05003v1)** | 2025-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One approach to reducing the massive costs of large language models (LLMs) is the use of quantized or sparse representations for training or deployment. While post-training compression methods are very popular, the question of obtaining even more accurate compressed models by directly training over such representations, i.e., Quantization-Aware Training (QAT), is still open: for example, a recent study (arXiv:2411.04330v2) put the "optimal" bit-width at which models can be trained using QAT, while staying accuracy-competitive with standard FP16/BF16 precision, at 8-bits weights and activations. We advance this state-of-the-art via a new method called QuEST, which is Pareto-competitive with FP16, i.e., it provides better accuracy at lower model size, while training models with weights and activations in 4-bits or less. Moreover, QuEST allows stable training with 1-bit weights and activations. QuEST achieves this by improving two key aspects of QAT methods: (1) accurate and fast quantization of the (continuous) distributions of weights and activations via Hadamard normalization and MSE-optimal fitting; (2) a new trust gradient estimator based on the idea of explicitly minimizing the error between the noisy gradient computed over quantized states and the "true" (but unknown) full-precision gradient. Experiments on Llama-type architectures show that QuEST induces stable scaling laws across the entire range of hardware-supported precisions, and can be extended to sparse representations. We provide GPU kernel support showing that models produced by QuEST can be executed efficiently. Our code is available at https://github.com/IST-DASLab/QuEST.</p></details> |  |
| **[MoGraphGPT: Creating Interactive Scenes Using Modular LLM and Graphical Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04983v1)** | 2025-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Creating interactive scenes often involves complex programming tasks. Although large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT can generate code from natural language, their output is often error-prone, particularly when scripting interactions among multiple elements. The linear conversational structure limits the editing of individual elements, and lacking graphical and precise control complicates visual integration. To address these issues, we integrate an element-level modularization technique that processes textual descriptions for individual elements through separate LLM modules, with a central module managing interactions among elements. This modular approach allows for refining each element independently. We design a graphical user interface, MoGraphGPT , which combines modular LLMs with enhanced graphical control to generate codes for 2D interactive scenes. It enables direct integration of graphical information and offers quick, precise control through automatically generated sliders. Our comparative evaluation against an AI coding tool, Cursor Composer, as the baseline system and a usability study show MoGraphGPT significantly improves easiness, controllability, and refinement in creating complex 2D interactive scenes with multiple visual elements in a coding-free manner.</p></details> | 16 pages, 10 figures |
| **[CoCoA: A Generalized Approach to Uncertainty Quantification by Integrating Confidence and Consistency of LLM Outputs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04964v1)** | 2025-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods for Large Language Models (LLMs) encompasses a variety of approaches, with two major types being particularly prominent: information-based, which focus on model confidence expressed as token probabilities, and consistency-based, which assess the semantic relationship between multiple outputs generated using repeated sampling. Several recent methods have combined these two approaches and shown impressive performance in various applications. However, they sometimes fail to outperform much simpler baseline methods. Our investigation reveals distinctive characteristics of LLMs as probabilistic models, which help to explain why these UQ methods underperform in certain tasks. Based on these findings, we propose a new way of synthesizing model confidence and output consistency that leads to a family of efficient and robust UQ methods. We evaluate our approach across a variety of tasks such as question answering, abstractive summarization, and machine translation, demonstrating sizable improvements over state-of-the-art UQ approaches.</p></details> |  |

The fingerprinting of Large Language Models (LLMs) has become essential for ensuring the security and transparency of AI-integrated applications. While existing methods primarily rely on access to direct interactions with the application to infer model identity, they often fail in real-world scenarios involving multi-agent systems, frequent model updates, and restricted access to model internals. In this paper, we introduce a novel fingerprinting framework designed to address these challenges by integrating static and dynamic fingerprinting techniques. Our approach identifies architectural features and behavioral traits, enabling accurate and robust fingerprinting of LLMs in dynamic environments. We also highlight new threat scenarios where traditional fingerprinting methods are ineffective, bridging the gap between theoretical techniques and practical application. To validate our framework, we present an extensive evaluation setup that simulates real-world conditions and demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods in identifying and monitoring LLMs in Gen-AI applications. Our results highlight the framework's adaptability to diverse and evolving deployment contexts.</p></details> |  |

However, most current interventions are designed as single-player games, presenting players with limited predefined choices. Such restrictions reduce replayability and may lead to an overly simplistic understanding of the processes of misinformation phenomenon and the debunking. This study seeks to address these issues, and empower people to better understand the opinion influencing and misinformation debunking processes. We did this by creating a Player versus Player (PvP) game where participants attempt to either generate or debunk misinformation to convince LLM-represented public opinion. Using a within-subjects mixed-methods study design (N=47), we found that this game significantly raised participants' media literacy and improved their ability to identify misinformation. Our qualitative exploration revealed how participants' use of debunking and content creation strategies deepened their understanding of the nature of disinformation. We demonstrate how LLMs can be integrated into PvP games to foster greater understanding of contrasting viewpoints and highlight social challenges.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Allies to Adversaries: Manipulating LLM Tool-Calling through Adversarial Injection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10198v2)** | 2025-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tool-calling has changed Large Language Model (LLM) applications by integrating external tools, significantly enhancing their functionality across diverse tasks. However, this integration also introduces new security vulnerabilities, particularly in the tool scheduling mechanisms of LLM, which have not been extensively studied. To fill this gap, we present ToolCommander, a novel framework designed to exploit vulnerabilities in LLM tool-calling systems through adversarial tool injection. Our framework employs a well-designed two-stage attack strategy. Firstly, it injects malicious tools to collect user queries, then dynamically updates the injected tools based on the stolen information to enhance subsequent attacks. These stages enable ToolCommander to execute privacy theft, launch denial-of-service attacks, and even manipulate business competition by triggering unscheduled tool-calling. Notably, the ASR reaches 91.67% for privacy theft and hits 100% for denial-of-service and unscheduled tool calling in certain cases. Our work demonstrates that these vulnerabilities can lead to severe consequences beyond simple misuse of tool-calling systems, underscoring the urgent need for robust defensive strategies to secure LLM Tool-calling systems.</p></details> |  |

Intent prediction (IP) is challenging and demands sufficient dialogs with human-labeled intents for training. However, manually annotating intents is resource-intensive. While large language models (LLMs) have been shown to be effective in generating synthetic data, there is no study on using LLMs to generate intent-aware information-seeking dialogs. In this paper, we focus on leveraging LLMs for zero-shot generation of large-scale, open-domain, and intent-aware information-seeking dialogs. We propose SOLID, which has novel self-seeding and multi-intent self-instructing schemes. The former improves the generation quality by using the LLM's own knowledge scope to initiate dialog generation; the latter prompts the LLM to generate utterances sequentially, and mitigates the need for manual prompt design by asking the LLM to autonomously adapt its prompt instruction when generating complex multi-intent utterances. Furthermore, we propose SOLID-RL, which is further trained to generate a dialog in one step on the data generated by SOLID. We propose a length-based quality estimation mechanism to assign varying weights to SOLID-generated dialogs based on their quality during the training process of SOLID-RL. We use SOLID and SOLID-RL to generate more than 300k intent-aware dialogs, surpassing the size of existing datasets. Experiments show that IP methods trained on dialogs generated by SOLID and SOLID-RL achieve better IP quality than ones trained on human-generated dialogs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NAACL 2025</p></details> |

Block Floating Point (BFP) has proven effective in accelerating linear operations, a cornerstone of LLM workloads. However, as sequence lengths grow, nonlinear operations, such as Attention, increasingly become performance bottlenecks due to their quadratic computational complexity. These nonlinear operations are predominantly executed using inefficient floating-point formats, which renders the system challenging to optimize software efficiency and hardware overhead. In this paper, we delve into the limitations and potential of applying BFP to nonlinear operations. Given our findings, we introduce a hardware-software co-design framework (DB-Attn), including: (i) DBFP, an advanced BFP version, overcomes nonlinear operation challenges with a pivot-focus strategy for diverse data and an adaptive grouping strategy for flexible exponent sharing. (ii) DH-LUT, a novel lookup table algorithm dedicated to accelerating nonlinear operations with DBFP format. (iii) An RTL-level DBFP-based engine is implemented to support DB-Attn, applicable to FPGA and ASIC. Results show that DB-Attn provides significant performance improvements with negligible accuracy loss, achieving 74% GPU speedup on Softmax of LLaMA and 10x low overhead performance improvement over SOTA designs.</p></details> |  |
| **[How to Make the Most of LLMs' Grammatical Knowledge for Acceptability Judgments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09639v2)** | 2025-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The grammatical knowledge of language models (LMs) is often measured using a benchmark of linguistic minimal pairs, where the LMs are presented with a pair of acceptable and unacceptable sentences and required to judge which is more acceptable. Conventional approaches directly compare sentence probabilities assigned by LMs, but recent large language models (LLMs) are trained to perform tasks via prompting, and thus, the raw probabilities they assign may not fully reflect their grammatical knowledge. In this study, we attempt to derive more accurate acceptability judgments from LLMs using prompts and templates. Through extensive experiments in English and Chinese, we compare nine judgment methods and find two of them, a probability readout method -- in-template LP and a prompt-based method -- Yes/No probability computing, achieve higher accuracy than the conventional ones. Our analysis reveals that these methods excel in different linguistic phenomena, suggesting they access different aspects of LLMs' knowledge. We also find that ensembling the two methods outperforms single methods. Consequently, we recommend these techniques, either individually or ensembled, as more effective alternatives to conventional approaches for assessing grammatical knowledge in LLMs.</p></details> | NAACL 2025 main |

However, existing HBD architectures face fundamental limitations in scalability, cost, and fault resiliency: switch-centric HBDs (e.g., NVL-72) incur prohibitive scaling costs, while GPU-centric HBDs (e.g., TPUv3/Dojo) suffer from severe fault propagation. Switch-GPU hybrid HBDs such as TPUv4 takes a middle-ground approach by leveraging Optical Circuit Switches, but the fault explosion radius remains large at the cube level (e.g., 64 TPUs). We propose InfinitePOD, a novel transceiver-centric HBD architecture that unifies connectivity and dynamic switching at the transceiver level using Optical Circuit Switching (OCS). By embedding OCS within each transceiver, InfinitePOD achieves reconfigurable point-to-multipoint connectivity, allowing the topology to adapt into variable-size rings. This design provides: i) datacenter-wide scalability without cost explosion; ii) fault resilience by isolating failures to a single node, and iii) full bandwidth utilization for fault-free GPUs. Key innovations include a Silicon Photonic (SiPh) based low-cost OCS transceiver (OCSTrx), a reconfigurable k-hop ring topology co-designed with intra-/inter-node communication, and an HBD-DCN orchestration algorithm maximizing GPU utilization while minimizing cross-ToR datacenter network traffic. The evaluation demonstrates that InfinitePOD achieves 31% of the cost of NVL-72, near-zero GPU waste ratio (over one order of magnitude lower than NVL-72 and TPUv4), near-zero cross-ToR traffic when node fault ratios under 7%, and improves Model FLOPs Utilization by 3.37x compared to NVIDIA DGX (8 GPUs per Node).</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM Query Scheduling with Prefix Reuse and Latency Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04677v1)** | 2025-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The efficient deployment of large language models (LLMs) in online settings requires optimizing inference performance under stringent latency constraints, particularly the time-to-first-token (TTFT) and time-per-output-token (TPOT). This paper focuses on the query scheduling problem for LLM inference with prefix reuse, a technique that leverages shared prefixes across queries to reduce computational overhead. Our work reveals previously unknown limitations of the existing first-come-first-serve (FCFS) and longest-prefix-match (LPM) scheduling strategies with respect to satisfying latency constraints. We present a formal theoretical framework for LLM query scheduling under RadixAttention, a prefix reuse mechanism that stores and reuses intermediate representations in a radix tree structure. Our analysis establishes the NP-hardness of the scheduling problem with prefix reuse under TTFT constraints and proposes a novel scheduling algorithm, $k$-LPM, which generalizes existing methods by balancing prefix reuse and fairness in query processing. Theoretical guarantees demonstrate that $k$-LPM achieves improved TTFT performance under realistic traffic patterns captured by a data generative model. Empirical evaluations in a realistic serving setting validates our findings, showing significant reductions in P99 TTFT compared to baseline methods.</p></details> |  |

However, given that document retrieval is an imprecise task and sometimes results in erroneous or even harmful content being presented in context, this raises the question of how LLMs handle retrieved information: If the provided content is incorrect, does the model know to ignore it, or does it recapitulate the error? Conversely, when the model's initial response is incorrect, does it always know to use the retrieved information to correct itself, or does it insist on its wrong prior response? To answer this, we curate a dataset of over 1200 questions across six domains (e.g., drug dosages, Olympic records, locations) along with content relevant to answering each question. We further apply precise perturbations to the answers in the content that range from subtle to blatant errors. We benchmark six top-performing LLMs, including GPT-4o, on this dataset and find that LLMs are susceptible to adopting incorrect retrieved content, overriding their own correct prior knowledge over 60% of the time. However, the more unrealistic the retrieved content is (i.e. more deviated from truth), the less likely the model is to adopt it. Also, the less confident a model is in its initial response (via measuring token probabilities), the more likely it is to adopt the information in the retrieved content. We exploit this finding and demonstrate simple methods for improving model accuracy where there is conflicting retrieved content. Our results highlight a difficult task and benchmark for LLMs -- namely, their ability to correctly discern when it is wrong in light of correct retrieved content and to reject cases when the provided content is incorrect.</p></details> | Revised June 9 2024 |

Unlike conventional LLM-based reasoning approaches, which rely solely on internal inference, Agentic Reasoning dynamically engages web search, code execution, and structured reasoning-context memory to solve complex problems requiring deep research and multi-step logical deduction. Our framework introduces the Mind Map agent, which constructs a structured knowledge graph to track logical relationships, improving deductive reasoning. Additionally, the integration of web-search and coding agents enables real-time retrieval and computational analysis, enhancing reasoning accuracy and decision-making. Evaluations on PhD-level scientific reasoning (GPQA) and domain-specific deep research tasks demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing models, including leading retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems and closed-source LLMs. Moreover, our results indicate that agentic reasoning improves expert-level knowledge synthesis, test-time scalability, and structured problem-solving.

| **[Can LLMs Convert Graphs to Text-Attributed Graphs?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10136v2)** | 2025-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graphs are ubiquitous structures found in numerous real-world applications, such as drug discovery, recommender systems, and social network analysis. To model graph-structured data, graph neural networks (GNNs) have become a popular tool. However, existing GNN architectures encounter challenges in cross-graph learning where multiple graphs have different feature spaces. To address this, recent approaches introduce text-attributed graphs (TAGs), where each node is associated with a textual description, which can be projected into a unified feature space using textual encoders. While promising, this method relies heavily on the availability of text-attributed graph data, which is difficult to obtain in practice. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel method named Topology-Aware Node description Synthesis (TANS), leveraging large language models (LLMs) to convert existing graphs into text-attributed graphs. The key idea is to integrate topological information into LLMs to explain how graph topology influences node semantics. We evaluate our TANS on text-rich, text-limited, and text-free graphs, demonstrating its applicability. Notably, on text-free graphs, our method significantly outperforms existing approaches that manually design node features, showcasing the potential of LLMs for preprocessing graph-structured data in the absence of textual information. The code and data are available at https://github.com/Zehong-Wang/TANS.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NAACL 25 Main Conference</p></details> |

Through both a survey of Black Americans ($n=$ 104) and annotation of LLM-produced AAE by Black Americans ($n=$ 228), we find that Black Americans favor choice and autonomy in determining when AAE is appropriate in LLM output. They tend to prefer that LLMs default to communicating in Mainstream U.S. English in formal settings, with greater interest in AAE production in less formal settings. When LLMs were appropriately prompted and provided in context examples, our participants found their outputs to have a level of AAE authenticity on par with transcripts of Black American speech.

However, current LLM inference systems, optimized for shared memory architectures like GPUs, fail to fully exploit these accelerators. We introduce WaferLLM, the first wafer-scale LLM inference system. WaferLLM is guided by a novel PLMR device model that captures the unique hardware characteristics of wafer-scale architectures. Leveraging this model, WaferLLM pioneers wafer-scale LLM parallelism, optimizing the utilization of hundreds of thousands of on-chip cores. It also introduces MeshGEMM and MeshGEMV, the first GEMM and GEMV implementations designed to scale effectively on wafer-scale accelerators. Evaluations show that WaferLLM achieves 200$\times$ better wafer-scale accelerator utilization than state-of-the-art systems. On a commodity wafer-scale accelerator, WaferLLM delivers 606$\times$ faster and 22$\times$ more energy-efficient GEMV compared to an advanced GPU. For LLMs, WaferLLM enables 39$\times$ faster decoding with 1.7$\times$ better energy efficiency. We anticipate these numbers will grow significantly as wafer-scale AI models, software, and hardware continue to mature.</p></details> |  |

While various representation intervention techniques have been proposed, these methods typically apply a universal representation correction vector to all input queries, limiting their effectiveness against diverse queries in practice. In this study, we introduce TruthFlow, a novel method that leverages the Flow Matching technique for query-specific truthful representation correction. Specifically, TruthFlow first uses a flow model to learn query-specific correction vectors that transition representations from hallucinated to truthful states. Then, during inference, the trained flow model generates these correction vectors to enhance the truthfulness of LLM outputs. Experimental results demonstrate that TruthFlow significantly improves performance on open-ended generation tasks across various advanced LLMs evaluated on TruthfulQA. Moreover, the trained TruthFlow model exhibits strong transferability, performing effectively on other unseen hallucination benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

There are several popular conjectures (e.g., tokenization, architecture and training data) regarding the reason for deficiency of LLMs in simple word-based counting problems, sharing the similar belief that such failure stems from model pretraining hence probably inevitable during deployment. In this paper, we carefully design multiple evaluation settings to investigate validity of prevalent conjectures. Meanwhile, we measure transferability of advanced mathematical and coding reasoning capabilities from specialized LLMs to simple counting tasks. Although specialized LLMs suffer from counting problems as well, we find conjectures about inherent deficiency of LLMs invalid and further seek opportunities to elicit knowledge and capabilities from LLMs that are beneficial to counting tasks. Compared with strategies such as finetuning and in-context learning that are commonly adopted to enhance performance on new or challenging tasks, we show that engaging reasoning is the most robust and efficient way to help LLMs better perceive tasks with more accurate responses. We hope our conjecture validation design could provide insights into the study of future critical failure modes of LLMs. Based on challenges in transferring advanced capabilities to much simpler tasks, we call for more attention to model capability acquisition and evaluation. We also highlight the importance of cultivating consciousness of "reasoning before responding" during model pretraining.</p></details> | NAACL 2025 |
| **[DFPE: A Diverse Fingerprint Ensemble for Enhancing LLM Performance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17479v2)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities across various natural language processing tasks but often struggle to excel uniformly in diverse or complex domains. We propose a novel ensemble method - Diverse Fingerprint Ensemble (DFPE), which leverages the complementary strengths of multiple LLMs to achieve more robust performance. Our approach involves: (1) clustering models based on response "fingerprints" patterns, (2) applying a quantile-based filtering mechanism to remove underperforming models at a per-subject level, and (3) assigning adaptive weights to remaining models based on their subject-wise validation accuracy. In experiments on the Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) benchmark, DFPE outperforms the best single model by 3% overall accuracy and 5% in discipline-level accuracy. This method increases the robustness and generalization of LLMs and underscores how model selection, diversity preservation, and performance-driven weighting can effectively address challenging, multi-faceted language understanding tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Heterogeneous Swarms: Jointly Optimizing Model Roles and Weights for Multi-LLM Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04510v1)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose Heterogeneous Swarms, an algorithm to design multi-LLM systems by jointly optimizing model roles and weights. We represent multi-LLM systems as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) of LLMs with topological message passing for collaborative generation. Given a pool of LLM experts and a utility function, Heterogeneous Swarms employs two iterative steps: role-step and weight-step. For role-step, we interpret model roles as learning a DAG that specifies the flow of inputs and outputs between LLMs. Starting from a swarm of random continuous adjacency matrices, we decode them into discrete DAGs, call the LLMs in topological order, evaluate on the utility function (e.g. accuracy on a task), and optimize the adjacency matrices with particle swarm optimization based on the utility score. For weight-step, we assess the contribution of individual LLMs in the multi-LLM systems and optimize model weights with swarm intelligence. We propose JFK-score to quantify the individual contribution of each LLM in the best-found DAG of the role-step, then optimize model weights with particle swarm optimization based on the JFK-score. Experiments demonstrate that Heterogeneous Swarms outperforms 15 role- and/or weight-based baselines by 18.5% on average across 12 tasks. Further analysis reveals that Heterogeneous Swarms discovers multi-LLM systems with heterogeneous model roles and substantial collaborative gains, and benefits from the diversity of language models.</p></details> |  |
| **[When One LLM Drools, Multi-LLM Collaboration Rules](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04506v1)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This position paper argues that in many realistic (i.e., complex, contextualized, subjective) scenarios, one LLM is not enough to produce a reliable output. We challenge the status quo of relying solely on a single general-purpose LLM and argue for multi-LLM collaboration to better represent the extensive diversity of data, skills, and people. We first posit that a single LLM underrepresents real-world data distributions, heterogeneous skills, and pluralistic populations, and that such representation gaps cannot be trivially patched by further training a single LLM. We then organize existing multi-LLM collaboration methods into a hierarchy, based on the level of access and information exchange, ranging from API-level, text-level, logit-level, to weight-level collaboration. Based on these methods, we highlight how multi-LLM collaboration addresses challenges that a single LLM struggles with, such as reliability, democratization, and pluralism. Finally, we identify the limitations of existing multi-LLM methods and motivate future work. We envision multi-LLM collaboration as an essential path toward compositional intelligence and collaborative AI development.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Autoregression: Fast LLMs via Self-Distillation Through Time](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21035v2)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autoregressive (AR) Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant success across numerous tasks. However, the AR modeling paradigm presents certain limitations; for instance, contemporary autoregressive LLMs are trained to generate one token at a time, which can result in noticeable latency. Recent advances have indicated that search and repeated sampling can enhance performance in various applications, such as theorem proving, code generation, and alignment, by utilizing greater computational resources during inference. In this study, we demonstrate that diffusion language models are capable of generating at least 32 tokens simultaneously, while exceeding the performance of AR models in text quality and on the LAMBADA natural language understanding benchmark. This outcome is achieved through a novel distillation method for discrete diffusion models, which reduces the number of inference steps by a factor of 32-64. Practically, at the 1.3B parameters scale, diffusion models, even without caching, can generate tokens at a rate that is up to 8 times faster than AR models employing KV-caching, and we anticipate further improvements with the inclusion of caching. Moreover, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach for diffusion language models with up to 860M parameters.</p></details> |  |
| **[Active Task Disambiguation with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04485v1)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the impressive performance of large language models (LLMs) across various benchmarks, their ability to address ambiguously specified problems--frequent in real-world interactions--remains underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce a formal definition of task ambiguity and frame the problem of task disambiguation through the lens of Bayesian Experimental Design. By posing clarifying questions, LLM agents can acquire additional task specifications, progressively narrowing the space of viable solutions and reducing the risk of generating unsatisfactory outputs. Yet, generating effective clarifying questions requires LLM agents to engage in a form of meta-cognitive reasoning, an ability LLMs may presently lack. Our proposed approach of active task disambiguation enables LLM agents to generate targeted questions maximizing the information gain. Effectively, this approach shifts the load from implicit to explicit reasoning about the space of viable solutions. Empirical results demonstrate that this form of question selection leads to more effective task disambiguation in comparison to approaches relying on reasoning solely within the space of questions.</p></details> |  |

To improve the efficiency of on-device deployment, small language models (SLMs) are often adopted due to their efficient decoding latency and reduced energy consumption. However, these SLMs often generate inaccurate responses when handling complex queries. One promising solution is uncertainty-based SLM routing, offloading high-stakes queries to stronger LLMs when resulting in low-confidence responses on SLM. This follows the principle of "If you lack confidence, seek stronger support" to enhance reliability. Relying on more powerful LLMs is yet effective but increases invocation costs. Therefore, striking a routing balance between efficiency and efficacy remains a critical challenge. Additionally, efficiently generalizing the routing strategy to new datasets remains under-explored. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive investigation into benchmarking and generalization of uncertainty-driven routing strategies from SLMs to LLMs over 1500+ settings. Our findings highlight: First, uncertainty-correctness alignment in different uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods significantly impacts routing performance. Second, uncertainty distributions depend more on both the specific SLM and the chosen UQ method, rather than downstream data. Building on the insight, we propose a calibration data construction instruction pipeline and open-source a constructed hold-out set to enhance routing generalization on new downstream scenarios. The experimental results indicate calibration data effectively bootstraps routing performance without any new data.</p></details> |  |

While existing studies predominantly focus on attack methods that require technical expertise, two critical questions remain underexplored: (1) Are jailbroken responses truly useful in enabling average users to carry out harmful actions? (2) Do safety vulnerabilities exist in more common, simple human-LLM interactions? In this paper, we demonstrate that LLM responses most effectively facilitate harmful actions when they are both actionable and informative--two attributes easily elicited in multi-step, multilingual interactions. Using this insight, we propose HarmScore, a jailbreak metric that measures how effectively an LLM response enables harmful actions, and Speak Easy, a simple multi-step, multilingual attack framework. Notably, by incorporating Speak Easy into direct request and jailbreak baselines, we see an average absolute increase of 0.319 in Attack Success Rate and 0.426 in HarmScore in both open-source and proprietary LLMs across four safety benchmarks. Our work reveals a critical yet often overlooked vulnerability: Malicious users can easily exploit common interaction patterns for harmful intentions.</p></details> |  |

While prior research has examined political bias in LLM outputs or their potential for automated fact-checking, their internal evaluation processes remain largely unexamined. Understanding how LLMs assess credibility provides insights into AI behavior and how credibility is structured and applied in large-scale language models. This study benchmarks the reliability and political classifications of state-of-the-art LLMs - Gemini 1.5 Flash (Google), GPT-4o mini (OpenAI), and LLaMA 3.1 (Meta) - against structured, expert-driven rating systems such as NewsGuard and Media Bias Fact Check. Beyond assessing classification performance, we analyze the linguistic markers that shape LLM decisions, identifying which words and concepts drive their evaluations. We uncover patterns in how LLMs associate credibility with specific linguistic features by examining keyword frequency, contextual determinants, and rank distributions. Beyond static classification, we introduce a framework in which LLMs refine their credibility assessments by retrieving external information, querying other models, and adapting their responses. This allows us to investigate whether their assessments reflect structured reasoning or rely primarily on prior learned associations.</p></details> |  |

While recent research has focused on optimizing prompt content, the role of prompt formatting, a critical but often overlooked dimension, has received limited systematic investigation. In this paper, we introduce Content-Format Integrated Prompt Optimization (CFPO), an innovative methodology that jointly optimizes both prompt content and formatting through an iterative refinement process. CFPO leverages natural language mutations to explore content variations and employs a dynamic format exploration strategy that systematically evaluates diverse format options. Our extensive evaluations across multiple tasks and open-source LLMs demonstrate that CFPO demonstrates measurable performance improvements compared to content-only optimization methods. This highlights the importance of integrated content-format optimization and offers a practical, model-agnostic approach to enhancing LLM performance. Code will be available at https://github.com/HenryLau7/CFPO.</p></details> |  |

We introduce a novel prototype that, driven by Large Language Models (LLMs), can compromise accounts within a real-life Active Directory testbed. Our research provides a comprehensive evaluation of the prototype's capabilities, and highlights both strengths and limitations while executing attack. The evaluation uses a realistic simulation environment (Game of Active Directory, GOAD) to capture intricate interactions, stochastic outcomes, and timing dependencies that characterize live network scenarios. The study concludes that autonomous LLMs are able to conduct Assumed Breach simulations, potentially democratizing access to penetration testing for organizations facing budgetary constraints. The prototype's source code, traces, and analyzed logs are released as open-source to enhance collective cybersecurity and facilitate future research in LLM-driven cybersecurity automation.</p></details> |  |

To mitigate attacks, one way is to perform adversarial training (AT)-based alignment, i.e., training LLMs on some of the most adversarial prompts to help them learn how to behave safely under attacks. During AT, the length of adversarial prompts plays a critical role in the robustness of aligned LLMs. This paper focuses on adversarial suffix jailbreak attacks and unveils that to defend against a jailbreak attack with an adversarial suffix of length $\Theta(M)$, it is enough to align LLMs on prompts with adversarial suffixes of length $\Theta(\sqrt{M})$. Theoretically, we analyze the adversarial in-context learning of linear transformers on linear regression tasks and prove a robust generalization bound for trained transformers. The bound depends on the term $\Theta(\sqrt{M_{\text{test}}}/M_{\text{train}})$, where $M_{\text{train}}$ and $M_{\text{test}}$ are the number of adversarially perturbed in-context samples during training and testing. Empirically, we conduct AT on popular open-source LLMs and evaluate their robustness against jailbreak attacks of different adversarial suffix lengths. Results confirm a positive correlation between the attack success rate and the ratio of the square root of the adversarial suffix during jailbreaking to the length during AT. Our findings show that it is practical to defend "long-length" jailbreak attacks via efficient "short-length" AT. The code is available at https://github.com/fshp971/adv-icl.</p></details> |  |

Our work aims to bridge this gap by delving into the Food domain, a universally relevant yet culturally diverse aspect of human life. We introduce FmLAMA, a multilingual dataset centered on food-related cultural facts and variations in food practices. We analyze LLMs across various architectures and configurations, evaluating their performance in both monolingual and multilingual settings. By leveraging templates in six different languages, we investigate how LLMs interact with language-specific and cultural knowledge. Our findings reveal that (1) LLMs demonstrate a pronounced bias towards food knowledge prevalent in the United States; (2) Incorporating relevant cultural context significantly improves LLMs' ability to access cultural knowledge; (3) The efficacy of LLMs in capturing cultural nuances is highly dependent on the interplay between the probing language, the specific model architecture, and the cultural context in question. This research underscores the complexity of integrating cultural understanding into LLMs and emphasizes the importance of culturally diverse datasets to mitigate biases and enhance model performance across different cultural domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>cultu...</summary><p>cultural bias analysis, cultural knowledge probing, large language models, cultural NLP; Accepted by NAACL2025</p></details> |

However, current methods have three unsolved issues: overlooking layer-wise sensitivity to KV cache quantization, high overhead of online fine-grained decision-making, and low flexibility to different LLMs and constraints. Therefore, we thoroughly analyze the inherent correlation of layer-wise transformer attention patterns to KV cache quantization errors and study why key cache is more important than value cache for quantization error reduction. We further propose a simple yet effective framework KVTuner to adaptively search for the optimal hardware-friendly layer-wise KV quantization precision pairs for coarse-grained KV cache with multi-objective optimization and directly utilize the offline searched configurations during online inference. To reduce the computational cost of offline calibration, we utilize the intra-layer KV precision pair pruning and inter-layer clustering to reduce the search space. Experimental results show that we can achieve nearly lossless 3.25-bit mixed precision KV cache quantization for LLMs like Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and 4.0-bit for sensitive models like Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct on mathematical reasoning tasks. The maximum inference throughput can be improved by 38.3% compared with KV8 quantization over various context lengths.</p></details> |  |

However, LLMs inherently reflect biases present in their training data, leading to a critical challenge: when these models generate synthetic data for training, they may propagate and amplify their inherent biases that can significantly impact model fairness and robustness on downstream tasks--a phenomenon we term bias inheritance. This work presents the first systematic investigation in understanding, analyzing, and mitigating bias inheritance. We study this problem by fine-tuning LLMs with a combined dataset consisting of original and LLM-augmented data, where bias ratio represents the proportion of augmented data. Through systematic experiments across 10 classification and generation tasks, we analyze how 6 different types of biases manifest at varying bias ratios. Our results reveal that bias inheritance has nuanced effects on downstream tasks, influencing both classification tasks and generation tasks differently. Then, our analysis identifies three key misalignment factors: misalignment of values, group data, and data distributions. Based on these insights, we propose three mitigation strategies: token-based, mask-based, and loss-based approaches. Experiments demonstrate that these strategies also work differently on various tasks and bias, indicating the substantial challenges to fully mitigate bias inheritance. We hope this work can provide valuable insights to the research of LLM data augmentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical report; 31 pages</p></details> |

One key issue affecting this reliability is order sensitivity, wherein slight variations in input arrangement can lead to inconsistent or biased outputs. Although recent advances have reduced this sensitivity, the problem remains unresolved. This paper investigates the extent of order sensitivity in closed-source LLMs by conducting experiments across multiple tasks, including paraphrasing, relevance judgment, and multiple-choice questions. Our results show that input order significantly affects performance across tasks, with shuffled inputs leading to measurable declines in output accuracy. Few-shot prompting demonstrates mixed effectiveness and offers partial mitigation, however, fails to fully resolve the problem. These findings highlight persistent risks, particularly in high-stakes applications, and point to the need for more robust LLMs or improved input-handling techniques in future development.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first 3 authors have contributed equally</p></details> |

In this domain, there is no publicly available question-answer dataset, which has impeded the development of a high-quality chatbot to support companies with IFRS reporting. The two key contributions of this project therefore are: (1) A high-quality synthetic question-answer (QA) dataset based on IFRS sustainability standards, created using a novel generation and evaluation pipeline leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs). This comprises 1,063 diverse QA pairs that address a wide spectrum of potential user queries in sustainability reporting. Various LLM-based techniques are employed to create the dataset, including chain-of-thought reasoning and few-shot prompting. A custom evaluation framework is developed to assess question and answer quality across multiple dimensions, including faithfulness, relevance, and domain specificity. The dataset averages a score range of 8.16 out of 10 on these metrics. (2) Two architectures for question-answering in the sustainability reporting domain - a RAG pipeline and a fully LLM-based pipeline. The architectures are developed by experimenting, fine-tuning, and training on the QA dataset. The final pipelines feature an LLM fine-tuned on domain specific data and an industry classification component to improve the handling of complex queries. The RAG architecture achieves an accuracy of 85.32% on single-industry and 72.15% on cross-industry multiple-choice questions, outperforming the baseline approach by 4.67 and 19.21 percentage points, respectively.

| **[CMoE: Fast Carving of Mixture-of-Experts for Efficient LLM Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04416v1)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) achieve impressive performance by scaling model parameters, but this comes with significant inference overhead. Feed-forward networks (FFNs), which dominate LLM parameters, exhibit high activation sparsity in hidden neurons. To exploit this, researchers have proposed using a mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture, where only a subset of parameters is activated. However, existing approaches often require extensive training data and resources, limiting their practicality. We propose CMoE (Carved MoE), a novel framework to efficiently carve MoE models from dense models. CMoE achieves remarkable performance through efficient expert grouping and lightweight adaptation. First, neurons are grouped into shared and routed experts based on activation rates. Next, we construct a routing mechanism without training from scratch, incorporating a differentiable routing process and load balancing. Using modest data, CMoE produces a well-designed, usable MoE from a 7B dense model within five minutes. With lightweight fine-tuning, it achieves high-performance recovery in under an hour. We make our code publicly available at https://github.com/JarvisPei/CMoE.</p></details> |  |
| **[AttentionPredictor: Temporal Pattern Matters for Efficient LLM Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04077v1)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the development of large language models (LLMs), efficient inference through Key-Value (KV) cache compression has attracted considerable attention, especially for long-context generation. To compress the KV cache, recent methods identify critical KV tokens through heuristic ranking with attention scores. However, these methods often struggle to accurately determine critical tokens as they neglect the \textit{temporal patterns} in attention scores, resulting in a noticeable degradation in LLM performance. To address this challenge, we propose AttentionPredictor, which is the first learning-based critical token identification approach. Specifically, AttentionPredictor learns a lightweight convolution model to capture spatiotemporal patterns and predict the next-token attention score. An appealing feature of AttentionPredictor is that it accurately predicts the attention score while consuming negligible memory. Moreover, we propose a cross-token critical cache prefetching framework that hides the token estimation time overhead to accelerate the decoding stage. By retaining most of the attention information, AttentionPredictor achieves 16$\times$ KV cache compression with comparable LLM performance, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art.</p></details> |  |
| **[Root Defence Strategies: Ensuring Safety of LLM at the Decoding Level](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06809v2)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated immense utility across various industries. However, as LLMs advance, the risk of harmful outputs increases due to incorrect or malicious instruction prompts. While current methods effectively address jailbreak risks, they share common limitations: 1) Judging harmful responses from the prefill-level lacks utilization of the model's decoding outputs, leading to relatively lower effectiveness and robustness. 2) Rejecting potentially harmful responses based on a single evaluation can significantly impair the model's helpfulness.This paper examines the LLMs' capability to recognize harmful outputs, revealing and quantifying their proficiency in assessing the danger of previous tokens. Motivated by pilot experiment results, we design a robust defense mechanism at the decoding level. Our novel decoder-oriented, step-by-step defense architecture corrects harmful queries directly rather than rejecting them outright. We introduce speculative decoding to enhance usability and facilitate deployment to boost secure decoding speed. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach improves model security without compromising reasoning speed. Notably, our method leverages the model's ability to discern hazardous information, maintaining its helpfulness compared to existing methods.</p></details> | 19 pages, 9 figures |

We test Ministral-8B, DeepSeek-V3, and GPT-4, finding that the latter two have reasonable agreement with humans and each other. We conclude that this approach is more cost-effective and similarly robust compared to a fine-grained multi-class approach, allowing automated quantity estimation across species.</p></details> | <details><summary>NoDaL...</summary><p>NoDaLiDa 2025, EcoNLP Workshop</p></details> |
| **[Decoder-Only LLMs are Better Controllers for Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04412v1)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Groundbreaking advancements in text-to-image generation have recently been achieved with the emergence of diffusion models. These models exhibit a remarkable ability to generate highly artistic and intricately detailed images based on textual prompts. However, obtaining desired generation outcomes often necessitates repetitive trials of manipulating text prompts just like casting spells on a magic mirror, and the reason behind that is the limited capability of semantic understanding inherent in current image generation models. Specifically, existing diffusion models encode the text prompt input with a pre-trained encoder structure, which is usually trained on a limited number of image-caption pairs. The state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) based on the decoder-only structure have shown a powerful semantic understanding capability as their architectures are more suitable for training on very large-scale unlabeled data. In this work, we propose to enhance text-to-image diffusion models by borrowing the strength of semantic understanding from large language models, and devise a simple yet effective adapter to allow the diffusion models to be compatible with the decoder-only structure. Meanwhile, we also provide a supporting theoretical analysis with various architectures (e.g., encoder-only, encoder-decoder, and decoder-only), and conduct extensive empirical evaluations to verify its effectiveness. The experimental results show that the enhanced models with our adapter module are superior to the stat-of-the-art models in terms of text-to-image generation quality and reliability.</p></details> |  |

However, this task is inherently complex, requiring the alignment and coordination of API systems, communication protocols, and even vehicle simulation systems to develop valid test cases. In practical industrial scenarios, inconsistencies, ambiguities, and interdependencies across various documents and system specifications pose significant challenges. This paper presents a system designed for the automated testing of in-vehicle APIs. By clearly defining and segmenting the testing process, we enable Large Language Models (LLMs) to focus on specific tasks, ensuring a stable and controlled testing workflow. Experiments conducted on over 100 APIs demonstrate that our system effectively automates vehicle API testing. The results also confirm that LLMs can efficiently handle mundane tasks requiring human judgment, making them suitable for complete automation in similar industrial contexts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE) 2025</p></details> |

Current work primarily applies supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to adapt the model for recommendation tasks. However, SFT on positive examples only limits the model's ability to align with user preference. To address this, researchers recently introduced Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), which explicitly aligns LLMs with user preferences using offline preference ranking data. However, we found that DPO inherently biases the model towards a few items, exacerbating the filter bubble issue and ultimately degrading user experience. In this paper, we propose SPRec, a novel self-play framework designed to mitigate over-recommendation and improve fairness without requiring additional data or manual intervention. In each self-play iteration, the model undergoes an SFT step followed by a DPO step, treating offline interaction data as positive samples and the predicted outputs from the previous iteration as negative samples. This effectively re-weights the DPO loss function using the model's logits, adaptively suppressing biased items. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate SPRec's effectiveness in enhancing recommendation accuracy and fairness. The implementation is available via https://github.com/RegionCh/SPRec</p></details> | Accepted by WWW 2025 |
| **[House of Cards: Massive Weights in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01866v2)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Massive activations, which manifest in specific feature dimensions of hidden states, introduce a significant bias in large language models (LLMs), leading to an overemphasis on the corresponding token. In this paper, we identify that massive activations originate not from the hidden state but from the intermediate state of a feed-forward network module in an early layer. Expanding on the previous observation that massive activations occur only in specific feature dimensions, we dive deep into the weights that cause massive activations. Specifically, we define top-$k$ massive weights as the weights that contribute to the dimensions with the top-$k$ magnitudes in the intermediate state. When these massive weights are set to zero, the functionality of LLMs is entirely disrupted. However, when all weights except for massive weights are set to zero, it results in a relatively minor performance drop, even though a much larger number of weights are set to zero. This implies that during the pre-training process, learning is dominantly focused on massive weights. Building on this observation, we propose a simple plug-and-play method called MacDrop (massive weights curriculum dropout), to rely less on massive weights during parameter-efficient fine-tuning. This method applies dropout to the pre-trained massive weights, starting with a high dropout probability and gradually decreasing it as fine-tuning progresses. Through various experiments, including zero-shot downstream tasks, long-context tasks, and ablation studies, we demonstrate that \texttt{MacDrop} generally improves performance and strengthens robustness.</p></details> | Under review |

However, parameter conflicts between models leads to performance degradation in averaging. While model routing addresses this issue by selecting individual models during inference, it imposes excessive storage and compute costs, and fails to leverage the common knowledge from different models. In this work, we observe that different layers exhibit varying levels of parameter conflicts. Building on this insight, we average layers with minimal parameter conflicts and use a novel task-level expert routing for layers with significant conflicts. To further reduce storage costs, inspired by task arithmetic sparsity, we decouple multiple fine-tuned experts into a dense expert and several sparse experts. Considering the out-of-distribution samples, we select and merge appropriate experts based on the task uncertainty of the input data. We conduct extensive experiments on both LLaMA and Qwen with varying parameter scales, and evaluate on real-world reasoning tasks. Results demonstrate that our method consistently achieves significant performance improvements while requiring less system cost compared to existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>work ...</summary><p>work in progress. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2405.09673 by other authors</p></details> |

Given the remarkable achievements of large language models (LLMs) in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, LLM-based relevance modeling is gradually being adopted within industrial search systems. Nevertheless, foundational LLMs lack domain-specific knowledge and do not fully exploit the potential of in-context learning. Furthermore, structured item text remains underutilized, and there is a shortage in the supply of corresponding queries and background knowledge. We thereby propose CPRM (Continual Pre-training for Relevance Modeling), a framework designed for the continual pre-training of LLMs to address these issues. Our CPRM framework includes three modules: 1) employing both queries and multi-field item to jointly pre-train for enhancing domain knowledge, 2) applying in-context pre-training, a novel approach where LLMs are pre-trained on a sequence of related queries or items, and 3) conducting reading comprehension on items to produce associated domain knowledge and background information (e.g., generating summaries and corresponding queries) to further strengthen LLMs. Results on offline experiments and online A/B testing demonstrate that our model achieves convincing performance compared to strong baselines.</p></details> |  |

These scams aim to exploit victims for financial gain, causing both monetary losses and psychological distress. While governments, industries, and academia have actively introduced various countermeasures, scammers also continue to evolve their tactics, making phone scams a persistent threat. To combat these increasingly sophisticated scams, detection technologies must also advance. In this work, we propose a framework for modeling scam calls and introduce an LLM-based real-time detection approach, which assesses fraudulent intent in conversations, further providing immediate warnings to users to mitigate harm. Through experiments, we evaluate the method's performance and analyze key factors influencing its effectiveness. This analysis enables us to refine the method to improve precision while exploring the trade-off between recall and timeliness, paving the way for future directions in this critical area of research.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |

To address this scalability challenge, we introduce a reference-free automatic feedback generator, which eliminates the need for costly human intervention. Our novel framework, C$^2$, consists of (1) an automatic feedback provider (ChartAF) and (2) a diverse, reference-free dataset (ChartUIE-8K). The results are compelling: in our first experiment, 74% of respondents strongly preferred, and 10% preferred, the results after feedback. The second post-feedback experiment demonstrates that ChartAF outperform nine baselines. Moreover, ChartUIE-8K significantly improves data diversity by increasing queries, datasets, and chart types by 5982%, 1936%, and 91%, respectively, over benchmarks. Finally, a study of LLM users revealed that 94% of participants preferred ChartUIE-8K's queries, with 93% deeming them aligned with real-world use cases.

Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), address the challenges of fine-tuning LLMs by significantly reducing the number of trainable parameters. Recent studies have integrated LoRA with Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures, leveraging multiple adapter experts and gating mechanisms to further improve fine-tuning performance. However, existing approaches primarily focus on adjusting the allocations of adapter experts per layer to optimize the introduced trainable parameter size, while neglecting a critical factor of adapters' rank. To this end, we propose a hierarchical scheme for expert allocation and rank configuration, HILO, which dynamically adjusts the number and rank of adapter experts across layers, matching the varying representational complexity of model layers in adapter-granularity. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark tasks demonstrate that HILO outperforms existing methods in accuracy while introducing fewer trainable parameters, providing an efficient and practical solution for fine-tuning LLMs.</p></details> |  |

Previous works on constructing NLU instructions mainly focus on information extraction (IE), neglecting tasks such as machine reading comprehension, question answering, and text classification. Furthermore, the lack of diversity in the data has led to a decreased generalization ability of trained LLMs in other NLU tasks and a noticeable decline in the fundamental model's general capabilities. To address this issue, we propose Hum, a large-scale, high-quality synthetic instruction corpus for NLU tasks, designed to enhance the NLU capabilities of LLMs. Specifically, Hum includes IE (either close IE or open IE), machine reading comprehension, text classification, and instruction generalist tasks, thereby enriching task diversity. Additionally, we introduce a human-LLMs collaborative mechanism to synthesize instructions, which enriches instruction diversity by incorporating guidelines, preference rules, and format variants. We conduct extensive experiments on 5 NLU tasks and 28 general capability evaluation datasets for LLMs. Experimental results show that Hum enhances the NLU capabilities of six LLMs by an average of 3.1\%, with no significant decline observed in other general capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |

Recently, there were attempts to distill the vast knowledge of LLMs into information retrieval systems. Those distillation methods mostly use output probabilities of LLMs which are unavailable in the latest black-box LLMs. We propose Syntriever, a training framework for retrievers using synthetic data from black-box LLMs. Syntriever consists of two stages. Firstly in the distillation stage, we synthesize relevant and plausibly irrelevant passages and augmented queries using chain-of-thoughts for the given queries. LLM is asked to self-verify the synthetic data for possible hallucinations, after which retrievers are trained with a loss designed to cluster the embeddings of relevant passages. Secondly in the alignment stage, we align the retriever with the preferences of LLMs. We propose a preference modeling called partial Plackett-Luce ranking to learn LLM preferences with regularization which prevents the model from deviating excessively from that trained in the distillation stage. Experiments show that Syntriever achieves state-of-the-art performances on benchmark datasets from various domains in nDCG@$K$.

Previous approaches have labeled rationales that produce correct answers for a given question as appropriate for training. However, a single measure risks misjudging rationale quality, leading the models to learn flawed reasoning patterns. To address this issue, we propose CREST (Consistency-driven Rationale Evaluation for Self-Training), a self-training framework that further evaluates each rationale through follow-up questions and leverages this evaluation to guide its training. Specifically, we introduce two methods: (1) filtering out rationales that frequently result in incorrect answers on follow-up questions and (2) preference learning based on mixed preferences from rationale evaluation results of both original and follow-up questions. Experiments on three question-answering datasets using open LLMs show that CREST not only improves the logical robustness and correctness of rationales but also improves reasoning abilities compared to previous self-training approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NAACL 2025</p></details> |

While various methods have been developed to generate synthetic data, there remains a discernible gap between the practical effects of synthetic data and our theoretical comprehension. To address this challenge, we commence by presenting a detailed modeling of the prevalent synthetic data generation process. Building upon this modeling, we demonstrate that the generalization capability of the post-trained model is critically determined by the information gain derived from the generative model, as analyzed from a novel reverse-bottleneck perspective. Moreover, we introduce the concept of Generalization Gain via Mutual Information (GGMI) and elucidate the relationship between generalization gain and information gain. This analysis serves as a theoretical foundation for synthetic data generation and further highlights its connection with the generalization capability of post-trained models, offering an understanding about the design of synthetic data generation techniques and the optimization of the post-training process.

While detecting LLM-generated content is crucial for mitigating these risks, current methods often focus on binary classification, failing to address the complexities of real-world scenarios like human-LLM collaboration. To move beyond binary classification and address these challenges, we propose a new paradigm for detecting LLM-generated content. This approach introduces two novel tasks: LLM Role Recognition (LLM-RR), a multi-class classification task that identifies specific roles of LLM in content generation, and LLM Influence Measurement (LLM-IM), a regression task that quantifies the extent of LLM involvement in content creation. To support these tasks, we propose LLMDetect, a benchmark designed to evaluate detectors' performance on these new tasks. LLMDetect includes the Hybrid News Detection Corpus (HNDC) for training detectors, as well as DetectEval, a comprehensive evaluation suite that considers five distinct cross-context variations and two multi-intensity variations within the same LLM role. This allows for a thorough assessment of detectors' generalization and robustness across diverse contexts. Our empirical validation of 10 baseline detection methods demonstrates that fine-tuned PLM-based models consistently outperform others on both tasks, while advanced LLMs face challenges in accurately detecting their own generated content. Our experimental results and analysis offer insights for developing more effective detection models for LLM-generated content. This research enhances the understanding of LLM-generated content and establishes a foundation for more nuanced detection methodologies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Socia...</summary><p>Social Media, Large Language Models, LLM-generated Text Detection, AI-assisted News Detection; Accepted by WWW2025</p></details> |

While integrating LLMs with tools can mitigate this reliability issue, models finetuned on tool usage only often over-rely on them, incurring unnecessary costs from resource-intensive scientific tools even for simpler problems. Inspired by how human experts assess the complexity of the problem before choosing the solutions, we propose a novel two-component fine-tuning method, Adapting While Learning (AWL). In the first component, World Knowledge Learning (WKL), LLMs internalize scientific knowledge by learning from tools-generated solutions. In the second component, Tool Usage Adaptation (TUA), we classify questions as easy or hard based on the WKL-trained model's accuracy, and train it to maintain direct reasoning for simple problems while switching to tools for challenging ones. We validate our method on 6 scientific benchmark datasets in climate science, epidemiology, and mathematics. Compared to the base 8B model, our trained models achieve 28.27% higher answer accuracy and 13.76% better tool usage accuracy, even surpassing state-of-the-art models including GPT-4 and Claude-3.5 on 4 custom-created datasets.</p></details> | 32 pages, 16 figures |

Unlike 16-bit floating-point formats, FP8 in deep learning requires a shared scaling factor. Additionally, while E4M3 and E5M2 are well-defined at the individual value level, their scaling and accumulation methods remain unspecified and vary across hardware and software implementations. As a result, FP8 behaves more like a quantization format than a standard numeric representation. In this work, we provide the first comprehensive analysis of FP8 computation and acceleration on two AI accelerators: the NVIDIA H100 and Intel Gaudi 2. Our findings highlight that the Gaudi 2, by leveraging FP8, achieves higher throughput-to-power efficiency during LLM inference, offering valuable insights into the practical implications of FP8 adoption for datacenter-scale LLM serving.</p></details> |  |

Low-cost, accurate identification of key markers of AD is crucial for timely diagnosis and intervention. Language impairment is one of the earliest signs of cognitive decline, which can be used to discriminate AD patients from normal control individuals. Patient-interviewer dialogues may be used to detect such impairments, but they are often mixed with ambiguous, noisy, and irrelevant information, making the AD detection task difficult. Moreover, the limited availability of AD speech samples and variability in their speech styles pose significant challenges in developing robust speech-based AD detection models. To address these challenges, we propose DECT, a novel speech-based domain-specific approach leveraging large language models (LLMs) for fine-grained linguistic analysis and label-switched label-preserved data generation. Our study presents four novelties: We harness the summarizing capabilities of LLMs to identify and distill key Cognitive-Linguistic information from noisy speech transcripts, effectively filtering irrelevant information. We leverage the inherent linguistic knowledge of LLMs to extract linguistic markers from unstructured and heterogeneous audio transcripts. We exploit the compositional ability of LLMs to generate AD speech transcripts consisting of diverse linguistic patterns to overcome the speech data scarcity challenge and enhance the robustness of AD detection models. We use the augmented AD textual speech transcript dataset and a more fine-grained representation of AD textual speech transcript data to fine-tune the AD detection model. The results have shown that DECT demonstrates superior model performance with an 11% improvement in AD detection accuracy on the datasets from DementiaBank compared to the baselines.</p></details> |  |

Commonly-used approaches such as value decomposition often lead to suboptimal policies in these settings, and designing dense reward functions that align with human intuition can be complex and labor-intensive. In this work, we propose a novel framework where a large language model (LLM) generates dense, agent-specific rewards based on a natural language description of the task and the overall team goal. By learning a potential-based reward function over multiple queries, our method reduces the impact of ranking errors while allowing the LLM to evaluate each agent's contribution to the overall task. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our approach achieves faster convergence and higher policy returns compared to state-of-the-art MARL baselines.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |

Yet, it is difficult to gauge the extent or accuracy of that knowledge, as LLMs do not always ``know what they know'' and may even be actively misleading. In this work, we give a general method for detecting semantic concepts in the internal activations of LLMs. Furthermore, we show that our methodology can be easily adapted to steer LLMs toward desirable outputs. Our innovations are the following: (1) we use a nonlinear feature learning method to identify important linear directions for predicting concepts from each layer; (2) we aggregate features across layers to build powerful concept detectors and steering mechanisms. We showcase the power of our approach by attaining state-of-the-art results for detecting hallucinations, harmfulness, toxicity, and untruthful content on seven benchmarks. We highlight the generality of our approach by steering LLMs towards new concepts that, to the best of our knowledge, have not been previously considered in the literature, including: semantic disambiguation, human languages, programming languages, hallucinated responses, science subjects, poetic/Shakespearean English, and even multiple concepts simultaneously. Moreover, our method can steer concepts with numerical attributes such as product reviews.

Their true potential depends on effective alignment to ensure correct, trustworthy and ethical behavior, addressing challenges like misinformation, hallucinations, bias and misuse. While existing Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based alignment methods are notoriously complex, direct optimization approaches offer a simpler alternative. In this work, we introduce a novel direct optimization approach for LLM alignment by drawing on established Information Retrieval (IR) principles. We present a systematic framework that bridges LLM alignment and IR methodologies, mapping LLM generation and reward models to IR's retriever-reranker paradigm. Building on this foundation, we propose LLM Alignment as Retriever Preference Optimization (LarPO), a new alignment method that enhances overall alignment quality. Extensive experiments validate LarPO's effectiveness with 38.9 % and 13.7 % averaged improvement on AlpacaEval2 and MixEval-Hard respectively. Our work opens new avenues for advancing LLM alignment by integrating IR foundations, offering a promising direction for future research.</p></details> | 26 pages |
| **[A Comparison of DeepSeek and Other LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03688v1)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, DeepSeek has been the focus of attention in and beyond the AI community. An interesting problem is how DeepSeek compares to other large language models (LLMs). There are many tasks an LLM can do, and in this paper, we use the task of predicting an outcome using a short text for comparison. We consider two settings, an authorship classification setting and a citation classification setting. In the first one, the goal is to determine whether a short text is written by human or AI. In the second one, the goal is to classify a citation to one of four types using the textual content. For each experiment, we compare DeepSeek with $4$ popular LLMs: Claude, Gemini, GPT, and Llama. We find that, in terms of classification accuracy, DeepSeek outperforms Gemini, GPT, and Llama in most cases, but underperforms Claude. We also find that DeepSeek is comparably slower than others but with a low cost to use, while Claude is much more expensive than all the others. Finally, we find that in terms of similarity, the output of DeepSeek is most similar to those of Gemini and Claude (and among all $5$ LLMs, Claude and Gemini have the most similar outputs). In this paper, we also present a fully-labeled dataset collected by ourselves, and propose a recipe where we can use the LLMs and a recent data set, MADStat, to generate new data sets. The datasets in our paper can be used as benchmarks for future study on LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 5 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |
| **[Premise-Augmented Reasoning Chains Improve Error Identification in Math reasoning with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02362v2)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting enhances mathematical reasoning in large language models (LLMs) by enabling detailed step-by-step solutions. However, due to the verbosity of LLMs, the resulting reasoning chains can be long, making it harder to verify the reasoning steps and trace issues resulting from dependencies between the steps that may be farther away in the sequence of steps. Importantly, mathematical reasoning allows each step to be derived from a small set of premises, which are a subset of the preceding steps in the reasoning chain. In this paper, we present a framework that identifies the premises for each step, to improve the evaluation of reasoning. We restructure conventional linear reasoning chains into Premise Augmented Reasoning Chains (PARC) by introducing premise links, resulting in a directed acyclic graph where the nodes are the steps and the edges are the premise links. Through experiments with a PARC-based dataset that we built, namely PERL (Premises and ERrors identification in LLMs), we demonstrate that LLMs can reliably identify premises within complex reasoning chains. In particular, even open-source LLMs achieve 90% recall in premise identification. We also show that PARC helps to identify errors in reasoning chains more reliably. The accuracy of error identification improves by 6% to 16% absolute when step-by-step verification is carried out in PARC under the premises. Our findings highlight the utility of premise-centric representations in addressing complex problem-solving tasks and open new avenues for improving the reliability of LLM-based reasoning evaluations.</p></details> |  |

However, traditional methods, whether matching-based or embedding-based, often fall short of judging subtle attributes and delivering satisfactory results. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) inspire the "LLM-as-a-judge" paradigm, where LLMs are leveraged to perform scoring, ranking, or selection across various tasks and applications. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of LLM-based judgment and assessment, offering an in-depth overview to advance this emerging field. We begin by giving detailed definitions from both input and output perspectives. Then we introduce a comprehensive taxonomy to explore LLM-as-a-judge from three dimensions: what to judge, how to judge and where to judge. Finally, we compile benchmarks for evaluating LLM-as-a-judge and highlight key challenges and promising directions, aiming to provide valuable insights and inspire future research in this promising research area. Paper list and more resources about LLM-as-a-judge can be found at https://github.com/llm-as-a-judge/Awesome-LLM-as-a-judge and https://llm-as-a-judge.github.io.</p></details> | <details><summary>v6: a...</summary><p>v6: add new citations; 36 pages, 5 figures</p></details> |
| **[Controlled LLM Decoding via Discrete Auto-regressive Biasing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03685v1)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Controlled text generation allows for enforcing user-defined constraints on large language model outputs, an increasingly important field as LLMs become more prevalent in everyday life. One common approach uses energy-based decoding, which defines a target distribution through an energy function that combines multiple constraints into a weighted average. However, these methods often struggle to balance fluency with constraint satisfaction, even with extensive tuning of the energy function's coefficients. In this paper, we identify that this suboptimal balance arises from sampling in continuous space rather than the natural discrete space of text tokens. To address this, we propose Discrete Auto-regressive Biasing, a controlled decoding algorithm that leverages gradients while operating entirely in the discrete text domain. Specifically, we introduce a new formulation for controlled text generation by defining a joint distribution over the generated sequence and an auxiliary bias sequence. To efficiently sample from this joint distribution, we propose a Langevin-within-Gibbs sampling algorithm using gradient-based discrete MCMC. Our method significantly improves constraint satisfaction while maintaining comparable or better fluency, all with even lower computational costs. We demonstrate the advantages of our controlled decoding method on sentiment control, language detoxification, and keyword-guided generation.</p></details> |  |

In contrast, humans effortlessly integrate new information, detect conflicts with existing beliefs, and selectively update their mental models. This paper introduces a cognitive-inspired investigation paradigm to study continual knowledge updating in LLMs. We implement two key components inspired by human cognition: (1) Dissonance and Familiarity Awareness, analyzing model behavior to classify information as novel, familiar, or dissonant; and (2) Targeted Network Updates, which track neural activity to identify frequently used (stubborn) and rarely used (plastic) neurons. Through carefully designed experiments in controlled settings, we uncover a number of empirical findings demonstrating the potential of this approach. First, dissonance detection is feasible using simple activation and gradient features, suggesting potential for cognitive-inspired training. Second, we find that non-dissonant updates largely preserve prior knowledge regardless of targeting strategy, revealing inherent robustness in LLM knowledge integration. Most critically, we discover that dissonant updates prove catastrophically destructive to the model's knowledge base, indiscriminately affecting even information unrelated to the current updates. This suggests fundamental limitations in how neural networks handle contradictions and motivates the need for new approaches to knowledge updating that better mirror human cognitive mechanisms.</p></details> |  |

The widely adopted approach in post-training popular open-source LLMs is to sequentially perform SFT and RLHF/DPO. However, sequential training is sub-optimal in terms of SFT and RLHF/DPO trade-off: the LLM gradually forgets about the first stage's training when undergoing the second stage's training. We theoretically prove the sub-optimality of sequential post-training. Furthermore, we propose a practical joint post-training framework with theoretical convergence guarantees and empirically outperforms sequential post-training framework, while having similar computational cost. Our code is available at https://github.com/heshandevaka/XRIGHT.</p></details> |  |
| **[Looking for the Inner Music: Probing LLMs' Understanding of Literary Style](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03647v1)** | 2025-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent work has demonstrated that language models can be trained to identify the author of much shorter literary passages than has been thought feasible for traditional stylometry. We replicate these results for authorship and extend them to a new dataset measuring novel genre. We find that LLMs are able to distinguish authorship and genre, but they do so in different ways. Some models seem to rely more on memorization, while others benefit more from training to learn author/genre characteristics. We then use three methods to probe one high-performing LLM for features that define style. These include direct syntactic ablations to input text as well as two methods that look at model internals. We find that authorial style is easier to define than genre-level style and is more impacted by minor syntactic decisions and contextual word usage. However, some traits like pronoun usage and word order prove significant for defining both kinds of literary style.</p></details> |  |

Inspired by the sequential thought structure of CoT, a number of Chain-of-X (CoX) methods have been developed to address various challenges across diverse domains and tasks involving LLMs. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of Chain-of-X methods for LLMs in different contexts. Specifically, we categorize them by taxonomies of nodes, i.e., the X in CoX, and application tasks. We also discuss the findings and implications of existing CoX methods, as well as potential future directions. Our survey aims to serve as a detailed and up-to-date resource for researchers seeking to apply the idea of CoT to broader scenarios.</p></details> | COLING 2025 |

To improve client-specific performance, personalization via the use of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) modules such as LoRA is common. This involves a personalization strategy (PS), such as the design of the PEFT adapter structures (e.g., in which layers to add LoRAs and what ranks) and choice of hyperparameters (e.g., learning rates) for fine-tuning. Instead of manual PS configuration, we propose FedP$^2$EFT, a federated learning-to-personalize method for multilingual LLMs in cross-device FL settings. Unlike most existing PEFT structure selection methods, which are prone to overfitting low-data regimes, FedP$^2$EFT collaboratively learns the optimal personalized PEFT structure for each client via Bayesian sparse rank selection. Evaluations on both simulated and real-world multilingual FL benchmarks demonstrate that FedP$^2$EFT largely outperforms existing personalized fine-tuning methods, while complementing a range of existing FL methods.</p></details> | Preprint |

The sheer volume of known vulnerabilities complicates the detection of patterns for unknown threats. While LLMs can assist, they often hallucinate and lack alignment with recent threats. Over 25,000 vulnerabilities have been identified so far in 2024, which are introduced after popular LLMs' (e.g., GPT-4) training data cutoff. This raises a major challenge of leveraging LLMs in cybersecurity, where accuracy and up-to-date information are paramount. In this work, we aim to improve the adaptation of LLMs in vulnerability analysis by mimicking how analysts perform such tasks. We propose ProveRAG, an LLM-powered system designed to assist in rapidly analyzing CVEs with automated retrieval augmentation of web data while self-evaluating its responses with verifiable evidence. ProveRAG incorporates a self-critique mechanism to help alleviate omission and hallucination common in the output of LLMs applied in cybersecurity applications. The system cross-references data from verifiable sources (NVD and CWE), giving analysts confidence in the actionable insights provided. Our results indicate that ProveRAG excels in delivering verifiable evidence to the user with over 99% and 97% accuracy in exploitation and mitigation strategies, respectively. This system outperforms direct prompting and chunking retrieval in vulnerability analysis by overcoming temporal and context-window limitations. ProveRAG guides analysts to secure their systems more effectively while documenting the process for future audits.</p></details> |  |

Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning(PEFT) methods have been proposed to address these challenges by freezing most model parameters and training only a small subset. While PEFT is efficient, it may not outperform full fine-tuning when high task-specific performance is required. Zeroth-Order (ZO) methods offer an alternative for fine-tuning the entire pre-trained model by approximating gradients using only the forward pass, thus eliminating the computational burden of back-propagation in first-order methods. However, when implementing ZO methods, a hard prompt is crucial, and relying on simple, fixed hard prompts may not be optimal. In this paper, we propose a bilevel optimization framework that complements ZO methods with PEFT to mitigate sensitivity to hard prompts while efficiently and effectively fine-tuning LLMs. Our Bilevel ZOFO (Zeroth-Order-First-Order) method employs a double-loop optimization strategy, where only the gradient of the PEFT model and the forward pass of the base model are required. We provide convergence guarantees for Bilevel ZOFO. Empirically, we demonstrate that Bilevel ZOFO outperforms both PEFT and ZO methods in single-task settings while maintaining similar memory efficiency. Additionally, we show its strong potential for multitask learning. Compared to current first-order meta-training algorithms for multitask learning, our method has significantly lower computational demands while maintaining or improving performance.</p></details> |  |

However, transmitting Key-Value (KV) data between the two stages can be a bottleneck, especially for long prompts. Additionally, the computation time overhead for prefill and decode is key for optimizing Job Completion Time (JCT), and KV data size can become prohibitive for long prompts and sequences. Existing KV quantization methods can alleviate the transmission bottleneck and reduce memory requirements, but they introduce significant dequantization overhead, exacerbating the computation time. We propose Homomorphic Acceleration via Compression of the KV cache (HACK) for disaggregated LLM inference. HACK eliminates the heavy KV dequantization step, and directly performs computations on quantized KV data to approximate and reduce the cost of the expensive matrix-multiplication step. Extensive trace-driven experiments show that HACK reduces JCT by up to 70.9% compared to disaggregated LLM inference baseline and by up to 52.3% compared to state-of-the-art KV quantization methods.</p></details> |  |

Given the high-stakes nature of healthcare, it is essential to ensure that LLM-generated content is accurate and reliable to prevent adverse outcomes. However, the development of robust evaluation metrics and methodologies remains a matter of much debate. We examine the performance of publicly available LLM-based chatbots for menopause-related queries, using a mixed-methods approach to evaluate safety, consensus, objectivity, reproducibility, and explainability. Our findings highlight the promise and limitations of traditional evaluation metrics for sensitive health topics. We propose the need for customized and ethically grounded evaluation frameworks to assess LLMs to advance safe and effective use in healthcare.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose SG-RwR, a Schema-Guided Retrieve-while-Reason framework for reasoning and planning with scene graphs. Our approach employs two cooperative, code-writing LLM agents: a (1) Reasoner for task planning and information queries generation, and a (2) Retriever for extracting corresponding graph information following the queries. Two agents collaborate iteratively, enabling sequential reasoning and adaptive attention to graph information. Unlike prior works, both agents are prompted only with the scene graph schema rather than the full graph data, which reduces the hallucination by limiting input tokens, and drives the Reasoner to generate reasoning trace abstractly.Following the trace, the Retriever programmatically query the scene graph data based on the schema understanding, allowing dynamic and global attention on the graph that enhances alignment between reasoning and retrieval. Through experiments in multiple simulation environments, we show that our framework surpasses existing LLM-based approaches in numerical Q\&A and planning tasks, and can benefit from task-level few-shot examples, even in the absence of agent-level demonstrations. Project code will be released.</p></details> |  |

In traffic scenarios, this impairment can even lead to safety concerns. In this paper, we introduce an LLM-simulated immersive projection environment designed to improve this ability in autistic children while ensuring their safety. We first propose 17 design considerations across four major categories, derived from a comprehensive review of previous research. Next, we developed a system called AIroad, which leverages LLMs to simulate drivers with varying social intents, expressed through explicit multimodal social signals. AIroad helps autistic children bridge the gap in recognizing the intentions behind behaviors and learning appropriate responses through various stimuli. A user study involving 14 participants demonstrated that this technology effectively engages autistic children and leads to significant improvements in their comprehension of social affordances in traffic scenarios. Additionally, parents reported high perceived usability of the system. These findings highlight the potential of combining LLM technology with immersive environments for the functional rehabilitation of autistic children in the future.</p></details> | iui2025 |

While the existing approaches primarily rely on value functions and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), the potential of simpler methods like Best-First Search (BFS) remains underexplored. This paper investigates whether BFS can achieve competitive performance in large-scale theorem proving tasks. We present \texttt{BFS-Prover}, a scalable expert iteration framework, featuring three key innovations. First, we implement strategic data filtering at each expert iteration round, excluding problems solvable via beam search node expansion to focus on harder cases. Second, we improve the sample efficiency of BFS through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) applied to state-tactic pairs automatically annotated with compiler error feedback, refining the LLM's policy to prioritize productive expansions. Third, we employ length normalization in BFS to encourage exploration of deeper proof paths. \texttt{BFS-Prover} achieves a score of $71.31$ on the MiniF2F test set and therefore challenges the perceived necessity of complex tree search methods, demonstrating that BFS can achieve competitive performance when properly scaled.</p></details> |  |

The adversary performs an OVERTHINK attack by injecting decoy reasoning problems into the public content that is used by the reasoning LLM (e.g., for RAG applications) during inference time. Due to the nature of our decoy problems (e.g., a Markov Decision Process), modified texts do not violate safety guardrails. We evaluated our attack across closed-(OpenAI o1, o1-mini, o3-mini) and open-(DeepSeek R1) weights reasoning models on the FreshQA and SQuAD datasets. Our results show up to 18x slowdown on FreshQA dataset and 46x slowdown on SQuAD dataset. The attack also shows high transferability across models. To protect applications, we discuss and implement defenses leveraging LLM-based and system design approaches. Finally, we discuss societal, financial, and energy impacts of OVERTHINK attack which could amplify the costs for third-party applications operating reasoning models.</p></details> |  |

In practical scenarios, existing methods based on modeling the mixture proportions of data composition often struggle with data whose domain labels are missing, imprecise or non-normalized, while methods based on data selection usually encounter difficulties in balancing multi-domain performance. To address these challenges, in this paper, we study the role of data diversity in enhancing the overall abilities of LLMs by empirically constructing contrastive data pools and theoretically deriving explanations for both inter- and intra-diversity. Building upon the insights gained, we propose a new method that gives the LLM a dual identity: an output model to cognitively probe and select data based on diversity reward, as well as an input model to be tuned with the selected data. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method notably boosts performance across domain-undetermined data and a series of foundational downstream tasks when applied to various advanced LLMs. We release our code and hope this study can shed light on the understanding of data diversity and advance feedback-driven data-model co-development for LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 15 figures, 11 tables</p></details> |

Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a crucial method for developing these capabilities, yet the conditions under which long CoTs emerge remain unclear, and RL training requires careful design choices. In this study, we systematically investigate the mechanics of long CoT reasoning, identifying the key factors that enable models to generate long CoT trajectories. Through extensive supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and RL experiments, we present four main findings: (1) While SFT is not strictly necessary, it simplifies training and improves efficiency; (2) Reasoning capabilities tend to emerge with increased training compute, but their development is not guaranteed, making reward shaping crucial for stabilizing CoT length growth; (3) Scaling verifiable reward signals is critical for RL. We find that leveraging noisy, web-extracted solutions with filtering mechanisms shows strong potential, particularly for out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks such as STEM reasoning; and (4) Core abilities like error correction are inherently present in base models, but incentivizing these skills effectively for complex tasks via RL demands significant compute, and measuring their emergence requires a nuanced approach. These insights provide practical guidance for optimizing training strategies to enhance long CoT reasoning in LLMs. Our code is available at: https://github.com/eddycmu/demystify-long-cot.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint, under review</p></details> |

OM systems currently have two prevailing design paradigms: conventional knowledge-based expert systems and newer machine learning-based predictive systems.

This study introduces a novel agent-powered LLM-based design paradigm for OM systems. With consideration of several specific challenges in leveraging LLM agents for OM, we propose a generic framework, namely Agent-OM (Agent for Ontology Matching), consisting of two Siamese agents for retrieval and matching, with a set of OM tools. Our framework is implemented in a proof-of-concept system. Evaluations of three Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI) tracks over state-of-the-art OM systems show that our system can achieve results very close to the long-standing best performance on simple OM tasks and can significantly improve the performance on complex and few-shot OM tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 12 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated their strong capabilities in natural language generation and reasoning, prompting the question: can LLMs effectively delegate participants in meetings? To explore this, we develop a prototype LLM-powered meeting delegate system and create a comprehensive benchmark using real meeting transcripts. Our evaluation reveals that GPT-4/4o maintain balanced performance between active and cautious engagement strategies. In contrast, Gemini 1.5 Pro tends to be more cautious, while Gemini 1.5 Flash and Llama3-8B/70B display more active tendencies. Overall, about 60\% of responses address at least one key point from the ground-truth. However, improvements are needed to reduce irrelevant or repetitive content and enhance tolerance for transcription errors commonly found in real-world settings. Additionally, we implement the system in practical settings and collect real-world feedback from demos. Our findings underscore the potential and challenges of utilizing LLMs as meeting delegates, offering valuable insights into their practical application for alleviating the burden of meetings.</p></details> |  |

Recently, zeroth-order (ZO) optimization stood out as a promising memory-efficient training paradigm, avoiding backward passes and relying solely on forward passes for gradient estimation, making it attractive for resource-constrained scenarios. However, ZO method lags far behind FO method in both convergence speed and accuracy. To bridge the gap, we introduce a novel layer-wise divergence analysis that uncovers the distinct update pattern of FO and ZO optimization. Aiming to resemble the learning capacity of FO method from the findings, we propose \textbf{Di}vergence-driven \textbf{Z}eroth-\textbf{O}rder (\textbf{DiZO}) optimization. DiZO conducts divergence-driven layer adaptation by incorporating projections to ZO updates, generating diverse-magnitude updates precisely scaled to layer-wise individual optimization needs. Our results demonstrate that DiZO significantly reduces the needed iterations for convergence without sacrificing throughput, cutting training GPU hours by up to 48\% on various datasets. Moreover, DiZO consistently outperforms the representative ZO baselines in fine-tuning RoBERTa-large, OPT-series, and Llama-series on downstream tasks and, in some cases, even surpasses memory-intensive FO fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |

LLM annotations are widely used, not only in NLP research but also in fields like medicine, psychology, and social science. Despite their role in shaping study results and insights, there is no standard or rigorous procedure to determine whether LLMs can replace human annotators. In this paper, we propose a novel statistical procedure -- the Alternative Annotator Test (alt-test) -- that requires only a modest subset of annotated examples to justify using LLM annotations. Additionally, we introduce a versatile and interpretable measure for comparing LLM judges. To demonstrate our procedure, we curated a diverse collection of ten datasets, consisting of language and vision-language tasks, and conducted experiments with six LLMs and four prompting techniques. Our results show that LLMs can sometimes replace humans with closed-source LLMs (such as GPT-4o), outperforming open-source LLMs, and that prompting techniques yield judges of varying quality. We hope this study encourages more rigorous and reliable practices.</p></details> |  |
| **[PERP: Rethinking the Prune-Retrain Paradigm in the Era of LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15230v3)** | 2025-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural Networks can be effectively compressed through pruning, significantly reducing storage and compute demands while maintaining predictive performance. Simple yet effective methods like magnitude pruning remove less important parameters and typically require a costly retraining procedure to restore performance. However, with the rise of LLMs, full retraining has become infeasible due to memory and compute constraints. This study challenges the practice of retraining all parameters by showing that updating a small subset of highly expressive parameters can suffice to recover or even enhance performance after pruning. Surprisingly, retraining just 0.01%-0.05% of the parameters in GPT-architectures can match the performance of full retraining across various sparsity levels, significantly reducing compute and memory requirements, and enabling retraining of models with up to 30 billion parameters on a single GPU in minutes. To bridge the gap to full retraining in the high sparsity regime, we introduce two novel LoRA variants that, unlike standard LoRA, allow merging adapters back without compromising sparsity. Going a step further, we show that these methods can be applied for memory-efficient layer-wise reconstruction, significantly enhancing state-of-the-art retraining-free methods like Wanda (Sun et al., 2023) and SparseGPT (Frantar & Alistarh, 2023). Our findings present a promising alternative to avoiding retraining.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 7 figures, 24 tables</p></details> |

The design of PICs is time-consuming and prone to errors due to the extensive and repetitive nature of code involved in photonic chip design. In this paper, we introduce PICBench, the first benchmarking and evaluation framework specifically designed to automate PIC design generation using LLMs, where the generated output takes the form of a netlist. Our benchmark consists of dozens of meticulously crafted PIC design problems, spanning from fundamental device designs to more complex circuit-level designs. It automatically evaluates both the syntax and functionality of generated PIC designs by comparing simulation outputs with expert-written solutions, leveraging an open-source simulator. We evaluate a range of existing LLMs, while also conducting comparative tests on various prompt engineering techniques to enhance LLM performance in automated PIC design. The results reveal the challenges and potential of LLMs in the PIC design domain, offering insights into the key areas that require further research and development to optimize automation in this field. Our benchmark and evaluation code is available at https://github.com/PICDA/PICBench.</p></details> |  |

Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting partially addresses this by revealing intermediate reasoning steps, but the knowledge flow and application remain implicit. We introduce IAO (Input-Action-Output) prompting, a structured template-based method that explicitly models how LLMs access and apply their knowledge during complex reasoning tasks. IAO decomposes problems into sequential steps, each clearly identifying the input knowledge being used, the action being performed, and the resulting output. This structured decomposition enables us to trace knowledge flow, verify factual consistency, and identify potential knowledge gaps or misapplications. Through experiments across diverse reasoning tasks, we demonstrate that IAO not only improves zero-shot performance but also provides transparency in how LLMs leverage their stored knowledge. Human evaluation confirms that this structured approach enhances our ability to verify knowledge utilization and detect potential hallucinations or reasoning errors. Our findings provide insights into both knowledge representation within LLMs and methods for more reliable knowledge application.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as Oral at KnowFM @ AAAI 2025</p></details> |

However, delivering a practical jailbreak defense is challenging because it needs to not only handle all the above jailbreak attacks but also incur negligible delays to user prompts, as well as be compatible with both open-source and closed-source LLMs. Inspired by how the traditional security concept of shadow stacks defends against memory overflow attacks, this paper introduces a generic LLM jailbreak defense framework called SelfDefend, which establishes a shadow LLM as a defense instance (in detection state) to concurrently protect the target LLM instance (in normal answering state) in the normal stack and collaborate with it for checkpoint-based access control. The effectiveness of SelfDefend builds upon our observation that existing LLMs can identify harmful prompts or intentions in user queries, which we empirically validate using mainstream GPT-3.5/4 models against major jailbreak attacks. To further improve the defense's robustness and minimize costs, we employ a data distillation approach to tune dedicated open-source defense models. When deployed to protect GPT-3.5/4, Claude, Llama-2-7b/13b, and Mistral, these models outperform seven state-of-the-art defenses and match the performance of GPT-4-based SelfDefend, with significantly lower extra delays. Further experiments show that the tuned models are robust to adaptive jailbreaks and prompt injections.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by USENIX Security Symposium 2025.

This paper introduces Themis, a fine-tuned LLM judge that delivers sophisticated context-aware evaluations. We provide a comprehensive overview of the development pipeline for Themis, highlighting its scenario-dependent evaluation prompts and two novel methods for controlled instruction generation. These designs enable Themis to effectively distill evaluative skills from teacher models, while retaining flexibility for continuous development. We introduce two human-labeled benchmarks for meta-evaluation, demonstrating that Themis can achieve high alignment with human preferences in an economical manner. Additionally, we explore insights into the LLM-as-a-judge paradigm, revealing nuances in performance and the varied effects of reference answers. Notably, we observe that pure knowledge distillation from strong LLMs, though common, does not guarantee performance improvement through scaling. We propose a mitigation strategy based on instruction-following difficulty. Furthermore, we provide practical guidelines covering data balancing, prompt customization, multi-objective training, and metric aggregation. We aim for our method and findings, along with the fine-tuning data, benchmarks, and model checkpoints, to support future research and development in this area.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted at WWW'25 (Industrial Track), extended version</p></details> |

To systematically investigate different techniques of cross-layer KV sharing, we propose a unified framework that covers several recent methods and their novel variants. We conduct comprehensive experiments on all the configurations of the framework, evaluating their generation throughput and performance in language modeling and downstream tasks. We find that when reducing the size of the KV cache by 2$\times$, most configurations can achieve higher throughput than standard transformers while maintaining competitive performance. When further reducing the size of the KV cache, however, pairing queries of all layers with KVs of upper layers performs better, at the expense of additional training cost and prefilling latency. We hope that this work will help users make more informed choices of cross-layer KV sharing approaches and facilitate future research on efficient LLM inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NAACL2025 main conference</p></details> |

Watermarking methods, particularly logit-based approaches, embed imperceptible identifiers into text to address these challenges. However, the widespread usage of watermarking across diverse LLMs has led to an inevitable issue known as watermark collision during common tasks, such as paraphrasing or translation. In this paper, we introduce watermark collision as a novel and general philosophy for watermark attacks, aimed at enhancing attack performance on top of any other attacking methods. We also provide a comprehensive demonstration that watermark collision poses a threat to all logit-based watermark algorithms, impacting not only specific attack scenarios but also downstream applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Long ...</summary><p>Long Paper, 9 pages, accepted at NAACL 2025 Findings</p></details> |

While low-bit quantization, such as 4-bit techniques, offers a potential solution, these methods often suffer from significant accuracy loss or require considerable effort for implementation such as reordering, rotation, etc. To address these challenges, we propose QRazor, a simple yet effective quantization scheme that enables 4-bit quantization of weights, activations, and KV cache in transformer-based LLMs. QRazor operates in two stages: first, quantizing data using 8 or 16-bit integers as a basis with absolute max scaling to preserve accuracy close to full-precision models, and second, compressing the quantized data to 4-bit using our significant data razoring (SDR) technique, which retains only the four most salient bits. Without any additional requirment of fine-tuning or additional training, QRazor achieves performance similar or better compared to state-of-the-art in 4-bit quantization method, surpassing Smoothquant and QLLM by over 12 points and Quarot(RTN) by more than 2.9 points in zero-shot reasoning task accuracy on the LLaMA2-7B model. Additionally, we introduce an integer-based arithmetic unit optimized for QRazor, allowing direct low-precision operations on SDR data without decompression.</p></details> | 16 pages |

By introducing an adaptive semantic variance threshold and a violation-triggered mechanism, FACTER automatically tightens fairness constraints whenever biased patterns emerge. We further develop an adversarial prompt generator that leverages historical violations to reduce repeated demographic biases without retraining the LLM. Empirical results on MovieLens and Amazon show that FACTER substantially reduces fairness violations (up to 95.5%) while maintaining strong recommendation accuracy, revealing semantic variance as a potent proxy of bias.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces Rationale-based Multiple Trait Scoring (RMTS), a novel approach for multi-trait essay scoring that integrates prompt-engineering-based large language models (LLMs) with a fine-tuning-based essay scoring model using a smaller large language model (S-LLM). RMTS uses an LLM-based trait-wise rationale generation system where a separate LLM agent generates trait-specific rationales based on rubric guidelines, which the scoring model uses to accurately predict multi-trait scores. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, including ASAP, ASAP++, and Feedback Prize, show that RMTS significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models and vanilla S-LLMs in trait-specific scoring. By assisting quantitative assessment with fine-grained qualitative rationales, RMTS enhances the trait-wise reliability, providing partial explanations about essays.

Most earlier works focus on fully or semi-supervised methods that require a large amount of human annotated data which is costly and time-consuming to acquire. To alleviate human efforts, in this paper, we work on hierarchical text classification with a minimal amount of supervision: using the sole class name of each node as the only supervision. Recently, large language models (LLM) have shown competitive performance on various tasks through zero-shot prompting, but this method performs poorly in the hierarchical setting because it is ineffective to include the large and structured label space in a prompt. On the other hand, previous weakly-supervised hierarchical text classification methods only utilize the raw taxonomy skeleton and ignore the rich information hidden in the text corpus that can serve as additional class-indicative features. To tackle the above challenges, we propose TELEClass, Taxonomy Enrichment and LLM-Enhanced weakly-supervised hierarchical text Classification, which combines the general knowledge of LLMs and task-specific features mined from an unlabeled corpus. TELEClass automatically enriches the raw taxonomy with class-indicative features for better label space understanding and utilizes novel LLM-based data annotation and generation methods specifically tailored for the hierarchical setting. Experiments show that TELEClass can significantly outperform previous baselines while achieving comparable performance to zero-shot prompting of LLMs with drastically less inference cost.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to WWW 2025 Research Track</p></details> |

A Preliminary Empirical Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11629v6)** | 2025-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) as evaluators to assess the performance of LLMs has garnered attention. However, this kind of evaluation approach is affected by potential biases within LLMs, raising concerns about the accuracy and reliability of the evaluation results of LLMs. To address this problem, we propose and study two many-shot In-Context Learning (ICL) prompt templates to help LLM evaluators mitigate potential biases: Many-Shot with Reference (MSwR) and Many-Shot without Reference (MSoR). Specifically, the former utilizes in-context examples with model-generated evaluation rationales as references, while the latter does not include these references. Using these prompt designs, we investigate the impact of increasing the number of in-context examples on the consistency and quality of the evaluation results. Experimental results show that advanced LLMs, such as GPT-4o, perform better in the many-shot regime than in the zero-shot and few-shot regimes. Furthermore, when using GPT-4o as an evaluator in the many-shot regime, adopting MSwR as the prompt template performs better than MSoR.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by COLING 2025</p></details> |

That is, the constructed network only requires a fixed number of neurons (and thus parameters) to approximate a $d$-variate continuous function on a $d$-dimensional hypercube with arbitrary accuracy. More specifically, only $\mathcal{O}(d^2)$ neurons or parameters are used. One natural question is whether we can reduce the number of these neurons or parameters in such a network. By leveraging a variant of the Kolmogorov Superposition Theorem, our analysis shows that there is a neural network generated by the elementary universal activation function with at most $10889d+10887$ unique nonzero parameters such that this super approximation property is attained. Furthermore, we present a family of continuous functions that requires at least width $d$, and thus at least $d$ neurons or parameters, to achieve arbitrary accuracy in its approximation. This suggests that the number of unique nonzero parameters is optimal in the sense that it grows linearly with the input dimension $d$, unlike some approximation methods where parameters may grow exponentially with $d$.</p></details> |  |
| **[Following Devils' Footprint: Towards Real-time Detection of Price Manipulation Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03718v1)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Price manipulation attack is one of the notorious threats in decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, which allows attackers to exchange tokens at an extensively deviated price from the market. Existing efforts usually rely on reactive methods to identify such kind of attacks after they have happened, e.g., detecting attack transactions in the post-attack stage, which cannot mitigate or prevent price manipulation attacks timely. From the perspective of attackers, they usually need to deploy attack contracts in the pre-attack stage. Thus, if we can identify these attack contracts in a proactive manner, we can raise alarms and mitigate the threats. With the core idea in mind, in this work, we shift our attention from the victims to the attackers. Specifically, we propose SMARTCAT, a novel approach for identifying price manipulation attacks in the pre-attack stage proactively. For generality, it conducts analysis on bytecode and does not require any source code and transaction data. For accuracy, it depicts the control- and data-flow dependency relationships among function calls into a token flow graph. For scalability, it filters out those suspicious paths, in which it conducts inter-contract analysis as necessary. To this end, SMARTCAT can pinpoint attacks in real time once they have been deployed on a chain. The evaluation results illustrate that SMARTCAT significantly outperforms existing baselines with 91.6% recall and ~100% precision. Moreover, SMARTCAT also uncovers 616 attack contracts in-the-wild, accounting for \$9.25M financial losses, with only 19 cases publicly reported. By applying SMARTCAT as a real-time detector in Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain, it has raised 14 alarms 99 seconds after the corresponding deployment on average. These attacks have already led to $641K financial losses, and seven of them are still waiting for their ripe time.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear on the Usenix Security 2025</p></details> |
| **[Semantic Entanglement-Based Ransomware Detection via Probabilistic Latent Encryption Mapping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02730v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Encryption-based attacks have introduced significant challenges for detection mechanisms that rely on predefined signatures, heuristic indicators, or static rule-based classifications. Probabilistic Latent Encryption Mapping presents an alternative detection framework that models ransomware-induced encryption behaviors through statistical representations of entropy deviations and probabilistic dependencies in execution traces. Unlike conventional approaches that depend on explicit bytecode analysis or predefined cryptographic function call monitoring, probabilistic inference techniques classify encryption anomalies based on their underlying statistical characteristics, ensuring greater adaptability to polymorphic attack strategies. Evaluations demonstrate that entropy-driven classification reduces false positive rates while maintaining high detection accuracy across diverse ransomware families and encryption methodologies. Experimental results further highlight the framework's ability to differentiate between benign encryption workflows and adversarial cryptographic manipulations, ensuring that classification performance remains effective across cloud-based and localized execution environments. Benchmark comparisons illustrate that probabilistic modeling exhibits advantages over heuristic and machine learning-based detection approaches, particularly in handling previously unseen encryption techniques and adversarial obfuscation strategies. Computational efficiency analysis confirms that detection latency remains within operational feasibility constraints, reinforcing the viability of probabilistic encryption classification for real-time security infrastructures. The ability to systematically infer encryption-induced deviations without requiring static attack signatures strengthens detection robustness against adversarial evasion techniques.</p></details> |  |
| **[Approximating Competitive Equilibrium by Nash Welfare](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09994v2)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We explore the relationship between two popular concepts in the allocation of divisible items: competitive equilibrium (CE) and allocations with maximum Nash welfare, i.e., allocations where the weighted geometric mean of the utilities is maximal. When agents have homogeneous concave utility functions, these two concepts coincide: the classical Eisenberg-Gale convex program that maximizes Nash welfare over feasible allocations yields a competitive equilibrium. However, these two concepts diverge for non-homogeneous utilities. From a computational perspective, maximizing Nash welfare amounts to solving a convex program for any concave utility functions, computing CE becomes PPAD-hard already for separable piecewise linear concave (SPLC) utilities. We introduce the concept of Gale-substitute utility functions, which is an analogue of the weak gross substitutes (WGS) property for the so-called Gale demand system. For Gale-substitutes utilities, we show that any allocation maximizing Nash welfare provides an approximate-CE with surprisingly strong guarantees, where every agent gets at least half the maximum utility they can get at any CE, and is approximately envy-free. Gale-substitutes include utility functions where computing CE is PPAD hard, such as all separable concave utilities and the previously studied non-separable class of Leontief-free utilities. We introduce a broad new class of utility functions called generalized network utilities based on the generalized flow model. This class includes SPLC and Leontief-free utilities, and we show that all such utilities are Gale-substitutes. Conversely, although some agents may get much higher utility at a Nash welfare maximizing allocation than at a CE, we show a price of anarchy type result: for general concave utilities, every CE achieves at least $(1/e)^{1/e} > 0.69$ fraction of the maximum Nash welfare, and this factor is tight.</p></details> |  |
| **[ACEBench: Who Wins the Match Point in Tool Learning?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12851v2)** | 2025-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in decision-making and reasoning, especially when combined with various tools to effectively solve complex problems. However, existing evaluation systems for assessing LLM function calling capabilities have several limitations: (1) limited evaluation scenarios, lacking assessments in real multi-turn dialogue contexts; (2) narrow evaluation dimensions, lacking detailed assessments for fine-grained function calls; (3) relying on LLMs or real API executions for result evaluation, which introduces significant overhead. To address these issues, we propose a comprehensive evaluation system named ACEBench. This system is meticulously designed to encompass a wide spectrum of function calling scenarios. Moreover, it categorizes these scenarios into three primary types according to the evaluation methodology: Normal, Special, and Agent. Normal evaluates function calls in basic scenarios; Special evaluates function calls in scenarios with vague or incomplete instructions; Agent introduces multi-agent interactions to simulate function calling evaluation in real-world multi-turn interactions. We conducted extensive experiments on ACEBench, analyzing various LLMs in-depth and performing a more granular analysis of error causes across different data types.</p></details> |  |
| **[CoCoNUT: Structural Code Understanding does not fall out of a tree](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16456v2)** | 2025-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance across a wide array of tasks involving both structured and unstructured textual data. Recent results on various benchmarks for code generation, repair, or completion suggest that certain models have programming abilities comparable to or even surpass humans. In this work, we demonstrate that high performance on such benchmarks does not correlate to humans' innate ability to understand structural control flow in code. To this end, we extract solutions from the HumanEval benchmark, which the relevant models perform strongly on, and trace their execution path using function calls sampled from the respective test set. Using this dataset, we investigate the ability of seven state-of-the-art LLMs to match the execution trace and find that, despite their ability to generate semantically identical code, they possess limited ability to trace execution paths, especially for longer traces and specific control structures. We find that even the top-performing model, Gemini, can fully and correctly generate only 47% of HumanEval task traces. Additionally, we introduce a subset for three key structures not contained in HumanEval: Recursion, Parallel Processing, and Object-Oriented Programming, including concepts like Inheritance and Polymorphism. Besides OOP, we show that none of the investigated models achieve an accuracy over 5% on the relevant traces. Aggregating these specialized parts with HumanEval tasks, we present CoCoNUT: Code Control Flow for Navigation Understanding and Testing, which measures a model's ability to trace execution of code upon relevant calls, including advanced structural components. We conclude that current LLMs need significant improvement to enhance code reasoning abilities. We hope our dataset helps researchers bridge this gap.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 2025 IEEE/ACM International Workshop on Large Language Models for Code (LLM4Code)</p></details> |

While LLMs have been effective for code generation, recent work has shown that PBE is challenging but improvable by fine-tuning, especially with training data drawn from the same distribution as evaluation data. In this paper, we create a conceptual framework of what constitutes a "similar distribution" for SLI and propose four kinds of synthetic data generation methods with varying amounts of inductive bias to investigate what leads to the best performance. Based on the results we create a SOTA open-source model for SLI as PBE (+6% pass rate with a third of the parameters of the second-best LLM) and also highlight exciting future directions for PBE research.</p></details> |  |

We analyze the mathematical properties of both real-valued and complex-valued Lehmer activation units and demonstrate their applications in modeling nonlinear interactions. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our proposed neural network achieves competitive accuracy on benchmark datasets with significantly improved computational efficiency. A single layer of real-valued or complex-valued Lehmer activation units is shown to deliver state-of-the-art performance, balancing efficiency with interpretability.</p></details> |  |

Querying databases is among the most effective of these integrations, enabling LLMs to access private or continually updating data. While Function Calling is the most common method for interfacing external tools to LLMs, its application to database querying as a tool has been underexplored. We propose a tool definition for database querying that unifies accessing data with search queries, filters, or a combination both, as well as transforming results with aggregation and groupby operators. To evaluate its effectiveness, we conduct a study with 8 LLMs spanning 5 model families. We present a novel pipeline adapting the Gorilla LLM framework to create synthetic database schemas and queries. We primarily evaluate the models with the Exact Match of predicted and ground truth query APIs. Among the models tested, Claude 3.5 Sonnet achieves the highest performance with an Exact Match score of 74.3%, followed by GPT-4o mini at 73.7%, and GPT-4o at 71.8%. We further breakdown these results per API component utilized and across synthetic use cases. We find that LLMs are highly effective at utilizing operators on boolean properties, but struggle with text property filters. Across use cases we find robust results with the higher performing models such as GPT-4o, but significant performance variance across use cases from lower performing models. We additionally conduct ablation studies exploring the impact of parallel tool calling, adding a rationale as an argument of the tool call, using a separate tool per database collection, and tool calling with structured outputs. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of enabling LLMs to query databases with Function Calling.

At the core of these agents, an LLM must plan, execute, and respond using external tools, APIs, and custom functions. Research on tool calling has gathered momentum, but evaluation benchmarks and datasets representing the complexity of the tasks have lagged behind. In this work, we focus on one such complexity, nested sequencing, with the goal of extending existing benchmarks and evaluation. Specifically, we present NESTFUL, a benchmark to evaluate LLMs on nested sequences of API calls, i.e., sequences where the output of one API call is passed as input to a subsequent call. NESTFUL contains 1800+ nested sequences where all the function calls are executable. Experimental results on multiple models and settings show that the best-performing model on the dataset has a full sequence match accuracy of 25% and win-rate of 34% necessitating a large scope for improvement in the nested sequencing aspect of function calling. Our analysis of these results provides possible future research directions for the community, in addition to a benchmark to track progress. We have released the NESTFUL dataset under the Apache 2.0 license at https://github.com/IBM/NESTFUL.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bypassing Array Canaries via Autonomous Function Call Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13256v1)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We observed the Array Canary, a novel JavaScript anti-analysis technique currently exploited in-the-wild by the Phishing-as-a-Service framework Darcula. The Array Canary appears to be an advanced form of the array shuffling techniques employed by the Emotet JavaScript downloader. In practice, a series of Array Canaries are set within a string array and if modified will cause the program to endlessly loop. In this paper, we demonstrate how an Array Canary works and discuss Autonomous Function Call Resolution (AFCR), which is a method we created to bypass Array Canaries. We also introduce Arphsy, a proof-of-concept for AFCR designed to guide Large Language Models and security researchers in the deobfuscation of "canaried" JavaScript code. We accomplish this by (i) Finding and extracting all Immediately Invoked Function Expressions from a canaried file, (ii) parsing the file's Abstract Syntax Tree for any function that does not implement imported function calls, (iii) identifying the most reassigned variable and its corresponding function body, (iv) calculating the length of the largest string array and uses it to determine the offset values within the canaried file, (v) aggregating all the previously identified functions into a single file, and (vi) appending driver code into the verified file and using it to deobfuscate the canaried file.</p></details> |  |
| **[Divide-Then-Aggregate: An Efficient Tool Learning Method via Parallel Tool Invocation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12432v1)** | 2025-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although current Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit impressive capabilities, performing complex real-world tasks still requires tool learning. Mainstream methods, such as CoT/ReAct, rely on step-by-step tool invocation to interact with external environments, but they are limited in perceptual scope and lack adequate task-planning capability. To address these limitations, other studies introduce the first Search-based Decision Tree (DFSDT), which still suffers from the high computational cost. In this paper, we introduce a novel parallel tool invocation paradigm, DTA-Llama (Divide-Then-Aggregate Llama). First, we transform traditional tree-based tool search paths into Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structure, generating a high-quality parallel tool invocation dataset. The DTA-Llama is then trained on the dataset to learn to iteratively divide the current task into several parallel tool invocation sub-tasks and aggregate the invocation results to decide the next actions. Furthermore, we introduce an efficient inference framework inspired by the Process/Threads mechanism when applying the DTA-Llama to practical tasks. Experimental results show that our approach substantially enhances task performance while reducing token consumption and inference time. Llama2-7B, using our method, is comparable to the official parallel function calling method of GPT-3.5. The relevant code, dataset, and model weights are available at https://corn0205.github.io/</p></details> |  |

Current approaches to enable tool usage often rely on model-specific prompting or fine-tuning a model for function-calling instructions. Both approaches have notable limitations, including reduced adaptability to unseen tools and high resource requirements. This paper introduces FREYR, a streamlined framework that modularizes the tool usage process into separate steps. Through this decomposition, we show that FREYR achieves superior performance compared to conventional tool usage methods. We evaluate FREYR on a set of real-world test cases specific for video game design and compare it against traditional tool usage as provided by the Ollama API.</p></details> | 15 pages |

We rank the optimisers with respect to metrics such as final energy achieved and function calls needed to get within a certain tolerance level, and find that the best performing optimisers are variants of gradient descent such as Momentum and ADAM (using finite difference), SPSA, CMAES, and BayesMGD. We also perform gradient analysis and observe that the step size for finite difference has a very significant impact. We also consider using simultaneous perturbation (inspired by SPSA) as a gradient subroutine: here finite difference can lead to a more precise estimate of the ground state but uses more calls, whereas simultaneous perturbation can converge quicker but may be less precise in the later stages. Finally, we also study the quantum natural gradient algorithm: we implement this method for 1-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard systems, and find that whilst it can reach a lower energy with fewer iterations, this improvement is typically lost when taking total function calls into account. Our method involves performing careful hyperparameter sweeping on 4 instances. We present a variety of analysis and figures, detailed optimiser notes, and discuss future directions.</p></details> | <details><summary>43 pa...</summary><p>43 pages, 30 figures.

However, evaluating the function calling abilities of LLMs in real-world scenarios remains under-explored due to the complexity of data collection and evaluation. In this work, we introduce ComplexFuncBench, a benchmark for complex function calling across five real-world scenarios. Compared to existing benchmarks, ComplexFuncBench encompasses multi-step and constrained function calling, which requires long-parameter filing, parameter value reasoning, and 128k long context. Additionally, we propose an automatic framework, ComplexEval, for quantitatively evaluating complex function calling tasks. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate the deficiencies of state-of-the-art LLMs in function calling and suggest future directions for optimizing these capabilities.

| **[A General Framework for Inference-time Scaling and Steering of Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06848v3)** | 2025-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models produce impressive results in modalities ranging from images and video to protein design and text. However, generating samples with user-specified properties remains a challenge. Recent research proposes fine-tuning models to maximize rewards that capture desired properties, but these methods require expensive training and are prone to mode collapse. In this work, we propose Feynman Kac (FK) steering, an inference-time framework for steering diffusion models with reward functions. FK steering works by sampling a system of multiple interacting diffusion processes, called particles, and resampling particles at intermediate steps based on scores computed using functions called potentials. Potentials are defined using rewards for intermediate states and are selected such that a high value indicates that the particle will yield a high-reward sample. We explore various choices of potentials, intermediate rewards, and samplers. We evaluate FK steering on text-to-image and text diffusion models. For steering text-to-image models with a human preference reward, we find that FK steering a 0.8B parameter model outperforms a 2.6B parameter fine-tuned model on prompt fidelity, with faster sampling and no training. For steering text diffusion models with rewards for text quality and specific text attributes, we find that FK steering generates lower perplexity, more linguistically acceptable outputs and enables gradient-free control of attributes like toxicity. Our results demonstrate that inference-time scaling and steering of diffusion models, even with off-the-shelf rewards, can provide significant sample quality gains and controllability benefits. Code is available at https://github.com/zacharyhorvitz/Fk-Diffusion-Steering .</p></details> |  |
| **[OptiChat: Bridging Optimization Models and Practitioners with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08406v1)** | 2025-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optimization models have been applied to solve a wide variety of decision-making problems. These models are usually developed by optimization experts but are used by practitioners without optimization expertise in various application domains. As a result, practitioners often struggle to interact with and draw useful conclusions from optimization models independently. To fill this gap, we introduce OptiChat, a natural language dialogue system designed to help practitioners interpret model formulation, diagnose infeasibility, analyze sensitivity, retrieve information, evaluate modifications, and provide counterfactual explanations. By augmenting large language models (LLMs) with functional calls and code generation tailored for optimization models, we enable seamless interaction and minimize the risk of hallucinations in OptiChat. We develop a new dataset to evaluate OptiChat's performance in explaining optimization models. Experiments demonstrate that OptiChat effectively bridges the gap between optimization models and practitioners, delivering autonomous, accurate, and instant responses.</p></details> |  |

The approach is based on an embedding of the system into a higher-dimensional feature space in which the dynamics become quadratic. Just like SINDy (Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics), our method requires trajectory data, time derivatives for the training data points, which can also be estimated using finite difference approximations, and a set of preselected basis functions, called dictionary. We illustrate the efficacy and accuracy of QENDy with the aid of various benchmark problems and compare its performance with SINDy and a deep learning method for identifying quadratic embeddings. Furthermore, we analyze the convergence of QENDy and SINDy in the infinite data limit, highlight their similarities and main differences, and compare the quadratic embedding with linearization techniques based on the Koopman operator.</p></details> |  |
| **[CallNavi: A Study and Challenge on Function Calling Routing and Invocation in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05255v1)** | 2025-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Interacting with a software system via a chatbot can be challenging, especially when the chatbot needs to generate API calls, in the right order and with the right parameters, to communicate with the system. API calling in chatbot systems poses significant challenges, particularly in complex, multi-step tasks requiring accurate API selection and execution. We contribute to this domain in three ways: first, by introducing a novel dataset designed to assess models on API function selection, parameter generation, and nested API calls; second, by benchmarking state-of-the-art language models across varying levels of complexity to evaluate their performance in API function generation and parameter accuracy; and third, by proposing an enhanced API routing method that combines general-purpose large language models for API selection with fine-tuned models for parameter generation and some prompt engineering approach. These approaches lead to substantial improvements in handling complex API tasks, offering practical advancements for real-world API-driven chatbot systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[ToolHop: A Query-Driven Benchmark for Evaluating Large Language Models in Multi-Hop Tool Use](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02506v2)** | 2025-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective evaluation of multi-hop tool use is critical for analyzing the understanding, reasoning, and function-calling capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, progress has been hindered by a lack of reliable evaluation datasets. To address this, we present ToolHop, a dataset comprising 995 user queries and 3,912 associated tools, specifically designed for rigorous evaluation of multi-hop tool use. ToolHop ensures diverse queries, meaningful interdependencies, locally executable tools, detailed feedback, and verifiable answers through a novel query-driven data construction approach that includes tool creation, document refinement, and code generation. We evaluate 14 LLMs across five model families (i.e., LLaMA3.1, Qwen2.5, Gemini1.5, Claude3.5, and GPT), uncovering significant challenges in handling multi-hop tool-use scenarios. The leading model, GPT-4o, achieves an accuracy of 49.04%, underscoring substantial room for improvement. Further analysis reveals variations in tool-use strategies for various families, offering actionable insights to guide the development of more effective approaches. Code and data can be found in https://huggingface.co/datasets/bytedance-research/ToolHop.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimizing Small Language Models for In-Vehicle Function-Calling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02342v1)** | 2025-01-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a holistic approach for deploying Small Language Models (SLMs) as function-calling agents within vehicles as edge devices, offering a more flexible and robust alternative to traditional rule-based systems. By leveraging SLMs, we simplify vehicle control mechanisms and enhance the user experience. Given the in-vehicle hardware constraints, we apply state-of-the-art model compression techniques, including structured pruning, healing, and quantization, ensuring that the model fits within the resource limitations while maintaining acceptable performance. Our work focuses on optimizing a representative SLM, Microsoft's Phi-3 mini, and outlines best practices for enabling embedded models, including compression, task-specific fine-tuning, and vehicle integration. We demonstrate that, despite significant reduction in model size which removes up to 2 billion parameters from the original model, our approach preserves the model's ability to handle complex in-vehicle tasks accurately and efficiently. Furthermore, by executing the model in a lightweight runtime environment, we achieve a generation speed of 11 tokens per second, making real-time, on-device inference feasible without hardware acceleration. Our results demonstrate the potential of SLMs to transform vehicle control systems, enabling more intuitive interactions between users and their vehicles for an enhanced driving experience.</p></details> |  |
| **[SR-Reward: Taking The Path More Traveled](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02330v1)** | 2025-01-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose a novel method for learning reward functions directly from offline demonstrations. Unlike traditional inverse reinforcement learning (IRL), our approach decouples the reward function from the learner's policy, eliminating the adversarial interaction typically required between the two. This results in a more stable and efficient training process. Our reward function, called \textit{SR-Reward}, leverages successor representation (SR) to encode a state based on expected future states' visitation under the demonstration policy and transition dynamics. By utilizing the Bellman equation, SR-Reward can be learned concurrently with most reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms without altering the existing training pipeline. We also introduce a negative sampling strategy to mitigate overestimation errors by reducing rewards for out-of-distribution data, thereby enhancing robustness. This strategy inherently introduces a conservative bias into RL algorithms that employ the learned reward. We evaluate our method on the D4RL benchmark, achieving competitive results compared to offline RL algorithms with access to true rewards and imitation learning (IL) techniques like behavioral cloning. Moreover, our ablation studies on data size and quality reveal the advantages and limitations of SR-Reward as a proxy for true rewards.</p></details> |  |

To tackle these challenges, this paper introduces ADC, an innovative approach that enhances LLMs' ability to follow function formats and match complex parameters. ADC utilizes a high-quality code fine-tuning dataset with line-level execution feedback, providing granular process supervision that fosters strong logical reasoning and adherence to function formats. It also employs an adversarial dataset generation process to improve parameter matching. The staged training methodology capitalizes on both enriched code datasets and refined adversarial datasets, leading to marked improvements in function calling capabilities on the Berkeley Function-Calling Leaderboard (BFCL) Benchmark. The innovation of ADC lies in its strategic combination of process supervision, adversarial refinement, and incremental learning, setting a new standard for LLM proficiency in complex function calling.</p></details> |  |

They are programs to determine cryptocurrency transactions, and are irreversible once deployed, making it crucial for cryptocurrency investors to understand the cryptocurrency transaction behaviors of smart contracts comprehensively. However, it is a challenging (if not impossible) task for investors, as they do not necessarily have a programming background to check the complex source code. Even for investors with certain programming skills, inferring all the potential behaviors from the code alone is still difficult, since the actual behaviors can be different when different investors are involved. To address this challenge, we propose PrettiSmart, a novel visualization approach via execution simulation to achieve intuitive and reliable visual interpretation of smart contracts. Specifically, we develop a simulator to comprehensively capture most of the possible real-world smart contract behaviors, involving multiple investors and various smart contract functions. Then, we present PrettiSmart to intuitively visualize the simulation results of a smart contract, which consists of two modules: The Simulation Overview Module is a barcode-based design, providing a visual summary for each simulation, and the Simulation Detail Module is an augmented sequential design to display the cryptocurrency transaction details in each simulation, such as function call sequences, cryptocurrency flows, and state variable changes. It can allow investors to intuitively inspect and understand how a smart contract will work. We evaluate PrettiSmart through two case studies and in-depth user interviews with 12 investors. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and usability of PrettiSmart in facilitating an easy interpretation of smart contracts.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Dark Side of Function Calling: Pathways to Jailbreaking Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17915v4)** | 2024-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, but their power comes with significant security considerations. While extensive research has been conducted on the safety of LLMs in chat mode, the security implications of their function calling feature have been largely overlooked. This paper uncovers a critical vulnerability in the function calling process of LLMs, introducing a novel "jailbreak function" attack method that exploits alignment discrepancies, user coercion, and the absence of rigorous safety filters. Our empirical study, conducted on six state-of-the-art LLMs including GPT-4o, Claude-3.5-Sonnet, and Gemini-1.5-pro, reveals an alarming average success rate of over 90\% for this attack. We provide a comprehensive analysis of why function calls are susceptible to such attacks and propose defensive strategies, including the use of defensive prompts. Our findings highlight the urgent need for enhanced security measures in the function calling capabilities of LLMs, contributing to the field of AI safety by identifying a previously unexplored risk, designing an effective attack method, and suggesting practical defensive measures.

Further improving the performance and robustness of community detection has attracted significant attention. This paper considers edge noise, which causes edges in the network to be added or removed. Existing methods achieve graph denoising through link prediction or robustness in low eigenvectors. However, they are either limited in application scenarios or not determined for effectiveness. We find that the noisy pixel in the adjacency matrix has a certain proportion in the loss function, which makes the optimization of the community detection model seriously deviate from the correct direction. Thus, we design an flexible framework to silence the contribution of noisy pixels to loss function, called Silencer. We take the nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) and deep NMF methods as examples since they are the prime models for community detection. We first prove the convergence of Silencer in NMF. Compared with existing methods, Silencer show top performance in six real-world networks with random noise, adversarial perturbation, and mixed noise. Moreover, Silencer works on random (ER), scale-free (BA), and small-world (WS) networks, and the improvement of Silencer is gradually insignificant in the order ER, BA, and WS networks.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces HammerBench, a novel benchmarking framework designed to assess the function-calling ability of LLMs more effectively in such interactions. We model a wide range of real-world user scenarios on mobile devices, encompassing imperfect instructions, diverse question-answer trajectories, intent/argument shifts, and the use of external individual information through pronouns. To construct the corresponding datasets, we propose a comprehensive pipeline that involves LLM-generated data and multiple rounds of human validation, ensuring high data quality. Additionally, we decompose the conversations into function-calling snapshots, enabling a fine-grained evaluation of each turn. We evaluate several popular LLMs using HammerBench and highlight different performance aspects. Our empirical findings reveal that errors in parameter naming constitute the primary factor behind conversation failures across different data types.</p></details> |  |

By leveraging these APIs as functional tools, enterprises can design diverse, scenario-specific agent applications, driven by on-premise function-calling models as the core engine. However, generic models often fail to meet enterprise requirements in terms of computational efficiency, output accuracy, and stability, necessitating scenario-specific adaptation. In this paper, we propose a training pipeline for function-calling capabilities tailored to real-world business scenarios. This pipeline includes the synthesis and augmentation of scenario-specific function-calling data, model fine-tuning, and performance evaluation and analysis. Using this pipeline, we generated 1,260 fully AI-generated samples and 1,035 augmented manually-labeled samples in digital HR agent scenario. The Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct model was employed as the base model and fine-tuned using the LoRA method on four GPUs with 24GB VRAM. Our fine-tuned model demonstrated outstanding performance in evaluations and practical applications, surpassing GPT-4 and GPT-4o in accuracy on the test set. These results validate the reliability of the proposed pipeline for training scenario-specific function-calling models.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 6 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

In this case, developers rely on stack traces, i.e., series of function calls that led to the error. Since there can be tens and hundreds of thousands of them describing the same issue from different users, automatic deduplication into categories is necessary to allow for processing. Recent works have proposed powerful deep learning-based approaches for this, but they are evaluated and compared in isolation from real-life workflows, and it is not clear whether they will actually work well at scale. To overcome this gap, this work presents three main contributions: a novel model, an industry-based dataset, and a multi-faceted evaluation. Our model consists of two parts - (1) an embedding model with byte-pair encoding and approximate nearest neighbor search to quickly find the most relevant stack traces to the incoming one, and (2) a reranker that re-ranks the most fitting stack traces, taking into account the repeated frames between them. To complement the existing datasets collected from open-source projects, we share with the community SlowOps - a dataset of stack traces from IntelliJ-based products developed by JetBrains, which has an order of magnitude more stack traces per category. Finally, we carry out an evaluation that strives to be realistic: measuring not only the accuracy of categorization, but also the operation time and the ability to create new categories. The evaluation shows that our model strikes a good balance - it outperforms other models on both open-source datasets and SlowOps, while also being faster on time than most. We release all of our code and data, and hope that our work can pave the way to further practice-oriented research in the area.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at SANER'25. 11 pages, 2 figures</p></details> |
| **[Unlock the Correlation between Supervised Fine-Tuning and Reinforcement Learning in Training Code Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10305v2)** | 2024-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatic code generation has been a longstanding research topic. With the advancement of general-purpose large language models (LLMs), the ability to code stands out as one important measure to the model's reasoning performance. Usually, a two-stage training paradigm is implemented to obtain a Code LLM, namely the pretraining and the fine-tuning. Within the fine-tuning, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and reinforcement learning (RL) are often used to improve the model's zero-shot ability. A large number of work has been conducted to improve the model's performance on code-related benchmarks with either modifications to the algorithm or refinement of the dataset. However, we still lack a deep insight into the correlation between SFT and RL. For instance, what kind of dataset should be used to ensure generalization, or what if we abandon the SFT phase in fine-tuning. In this work, we make an attempt to understand the correlation between SFT and RL. To facilitate our research, we manually craft 100 basis python functions, called atomic functions, and then a synthesizing pipeline is deployed to create a large number of synthetic functions on top of the atomic ones. In this manner, we ensure that the train and test sets remain distinct, preventing data contamination. Through comprehensive ablation study, we find: (1) Both atomic and synthetic functions are indispensable for SFT's generalization, and only a handful of synthetic functions are adequate; (2) Through RL, the SFT's generalization to target domain can be greatly enhanced, even with the same training prompts; (3) Training RL from scratch can alleviate the over-fitting issue introduced in the SFT phase.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tube Loss: A Novel Approach for Prediction Interval Estimation and probabilistic forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06853v2)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a novel loss function, called 'Tube Loss', for simultaneous estimation of bounds of a Prediction Interval (PI) in the regression setup, and also for generating probabilistic forecasts from time series data solving a single optimization problem. The PIs obtained by minimizing the empirical risk based on the Tube Loss are shown to be of better quality than the PIs obtained by the existing methods in the following sense. First, it yields intervals that attain the prespecified confidence level $t \in(0,1)$ asymptotically. A theoretical proof of this fact is given. Secondly, the user is allowed to move the interval up or down by controlling the value of a parameter. This helps the user to choose a PI capturing denser regions of the probability distribution of the response variable inside the interval, and thus, sharpening its width. This is shown to be especially useful when the conditional distribution of the response variable is skewed. Further, the Tube Loss based PI estimation method can trade-off between the coverage and the average width by solving a single optimization problem. It enables further reduction of the average width of PI through re-calibration. Also, unlike a few existing PI estimation methods the gradient descent (GD) method can be used for minimization of empirical risk. Finally, through extensive experimentation, we have shown the efficacy of the Tube Loss based PI estimation in kernel machines, neural networks and deep networks and also for probabilistic forecasting tasks. The codes of the experiments are available at https://github.com/ltpritamanand/Tube_loss</p></details> |  |

By analyzing compile-time information, such as function call graphs' features, loop information, and memory operations, FuzzDistill identifies high-priority areas of the codebase that are more probable to contain vulnerabilities. I demonstrate the efficacy of my approach through experiments conducted on real-world software, demonstrating substantial reductions in testing time.</p></details> |  |
| **[Asynchronous LLM Function Calling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07017v1)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) use function calls to interface with external tools and data source. However, the current approach to LLM function calling is inherently synchronous, where each call blocks LLM inference, limiting LLM operation and concurrent function execution. In this work, we propose AsyncLM, a system for asynchronous LLM function calling. AsyncLM improves LLM's operational efficiency by enabling LLMs to generate and execute function calls concurrently. Instead of waiting for each call's completion, AsyncLM introduces an interrupt mechanism to asynchronously notify the LLM in-flight when function calls return. We design an in-context protocol for function calls and interrupts, provide fine-tuning strategy to adapt LLMs to the interrupt semantics, and implement these mechanisms efficiently on LLM inference process. We demonstrate that AsyncLM can reduce end-to-end task completion latency from 1.6x-5.4x compared to synchronous function calling on a set of benchmark tasks in the Berkeley function calling leaderboard (BFCL). Furthermore, we discuss how interrupt mechanisms can be extended to enable novel human-LLM or LLM-LLM interactions.</p></details> |  |

Unfortunately, modern applications codebases exhibit highly variant behavior across different inputs, creating challenges for conventional profiling approaches that rely on a single execution instance. In this paper, we propose \textbf{Phaedrus}, a new \textit{compiler-assisted deep learning framework} designed to predict dynamic program behaviors across varied execution scenarios, specifically focusing on dynamic function call prediction. Traditional profile-guided optimization methods struggle with the input-dependent variability of modern applications, where profiling on different inputs yields divergent application behaviors. To address this, Phaedrus proposes two new approaches: \textit{Application Profile Generalization}, which uses generative models trained on compressed and augmented \textit{Whole Program Path} (WPP) profiles to predict application behavior under unseen inputs, and \textit{Application Behavior Synthesis}, a profile-less approach where Large Language Models (LLMs) directly infer dynamic functions based on source code \& static compiler analysis, bypassing the need for traditional profiling. Our experiments show that \textit{Phaedrus} can achieve upto $10^7X$ reduction in WPP profile sizes, can predict dynamic hot functions that cover upto 85-99\% of the execution time, along with an average of \textbf{13.46\%} (upto \textbf{65\%}) reduction in application binary size reduction, without profiles.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning from Snapshots of Discrete and Continuous Data Streams](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06079v1)** | 2024-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Imagine a smart camera trap selectively clicking pictures to understand animal movement patterns within a particular habitat. These "snapshots", or pieces of data captured from a data stream at adaptively chosen times, provide a glimpse of different animal movements unfolding through time. Learning a continuous-time process through snapshots, such as smart camera traps, is a central theme governing a wide array of online learning situations. In this paper, we adopt a learning-theoretic perspective in understanding the fundamental nature of learning different classes of functions from both discrete data streams and continuous data streams. In our first framework, the \textit{update-and-deploy} setting, a learning algorithm discretely queries from a process to update a predictor designed to make predictions given as input the data stream. We construct a uniform sampling algorithm that can learn with bounded error any concept class with finite Littlestone dimension. Our second framework, known as the \emph{blind-prediction} setting, consists of a learning algorithm generating predictions independently of observing the process, only engaging with the process when it chooses to make queries. Interestingly, we show a stark contrast in learnability where non-trivial concept classes are unlearnable. However, we show that adaptive learning algorithms are necessary to learn sets of time-dependent and data-dependent functions, called pattern classes, in either framework. Finally, we develop a theory of pattern classes under discrete data streams for the blind-prediction setting.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Machine Learning-Based Approach For Detecting Malicious PyPI Packages](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05259v1)** | 2024-12-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background. In modern software development, the use of external libraries and packages is increasingly prevalent, streamlining the software development process and enabling developers to deploy feature-rich systems with little coding. While this reliance on reusing code offers substantial benefits, it also introduces serious risks for deployed software in the form of malicious packages - harmful and vulnerable code disguised as useful libraries. Aims. Popular ecosystems, such PyPI, receive thousands of new package contributions every week, and distinguishing safe contributions from harmful ones presents a significant challenge. There is a dire need for reliable methods to detect and address the presence of malicious packages in these environments. Method. To address these challenges, we propose a data-driven approach that uses machine learning and static analysis to examine the package's metadata, code, files, and textual characteristics to identify malicious packages. Results. In evaluations conducted within the PyPI ecosystem, we achieved an F1-measure of 0.94 for identifying malicious packages using a stacking ensemble classifier. Conclusions. This tool can be seamlessly integrated into package vetting pipelines and has the capability to flag entire packages, not just malicious function calls. This enhancement strengthens security measures and reduces the manual workload for developers and registry maintainers, thereby contributing to the overall integrity of the ecosystem.</p></details> |  |

Research indicates that over 40% of potential energy savings can be achieved during the early design stage. Therefore, decision-making in green building design (DGBD), which is based on modeling and performance simulation, is crucial for reducing building energy costs. However, the field of green building encompasses a broad range of specialized knowledge, which involves significant learning costs and results in low decision-making efficiency. Many studies have already applied artificial intelligence (AI) methods to this field. Based on previous research, this study innovatively integrates large language models with DGBD, creating GreenQA, a question answering framework for multimodal data reasoning. Utilizing Retrieval Augmented Generation, Chain of Thought, and Function Call methods, GreenQA enables multimodal question answering, including weather data analysis and visualization, retrieval of green building cases, and knowledge query. Additionally, this study conducted a user survey using the GreenQA web platform. The results showed that 96% of users believed the platform helped improve design efficiency. This study not only effectively supports DGBD but also provides inspiration for AI-assisted design.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at Association for Computer Aided Design in Architecture (ACADIA) 2024</p></details> |
| **[Explainable Malware Detection through Integrated Graph Reduction and Learning Techniques](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03634v1)** | 2024-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Control Flow Graphs and Function Call Graphs have become pivotal in providing a detailed understanding of program execution and effectively characterizing the behavior of malware. These graph-based representations, when combined with Graph Neural Networks (GNN), have shown promise in developing high-performance malware detectors. However, challenges remain due to the large size of these graphs and the inherent opacity in the decision-making process of GNNs. This paper addresses these issues by developing several graph reduction techniques to reduce graph size and applying the state-of-the-art GNNExplainer to enhance the interpretability of GNN outputs. The analysis demonstrates that integrating our proposed graph reduction technique along with GNNExplainer in the malware detection framework significantly reduces graph size while preserving high performance, providing an effective balance between efficiency and transparency in malware detection.</p></details> |  |

This research delves into enhancing the function-calling capabilities of LLMs by exploring different approaches, including prompt formats for integrating function descriptions, blending function-calling and instruction-following data, introducing a novel Decision Token for conditional prompts, leveraging chain-of-thought reasoning, and overcoming multilingual challenges with a translation pipeline. Our key findings and contributions are as follows: (1) Instruction-following data improves both function-calling accuracy and relevance detection. (2) The use of the newly proposed Decision Token, combined with synthetic non-function-call data, enhances relevance detection. (3) A tailored translation pipeline effectively overcomes multilingual limitations, demonstrating significant improvements in Traditional Chinese. These insights highlight the potential for improved function-calling capabilities and multilingual applications in LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Kolmogorov Superposition Theorem can Break the Curse of Dimensionality When Approximating High Dimensional Functions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.09963v5)** | 2024-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We explain how to use Kolmogorov Superposition Theorem (KST) to break the curse of dimensionality when approximating a dense class of multivariate continuous functions. We first show that there is a class of functions called Kolmogorov-Lipschitz (KL) continuous in $C([0,1]^d)$ which can be approximated by a special ReLU neural network of two hidden layers with a dimension independent approximation rate $O(1/n)$ with approximation constant increasing quadratically in $d$. The number of parameters used in such neural network approximation equals to $(6d+2)n$. Next we introduce KB-splines by using linear B-splines to replace the outer function and smooth the KB-splines to have the so-called LKB-splines as the basis for approximation. Our numerical evidence shows that the curse of dimensionality is broken in the following sense: When using the standard discrete least squares (DLS) method to approximate a continuous function, there exists a pivotal set of points in $[0,1]^d$ with size at most $O(nd)$ such that the rooted mean squares error (RMSE) from the DLS based on the pivotal set is similar to the RMSE of the DLS based on the original set with size $O(n^d)$. The pivotal point set is chosen by using matrix cross approximation technique and the number of LKB-splines used for approximation is the same as the size of the pivotal data set. Therefore, we do not need too many basis functions as well as too many function values to approximate a high dimensional continuous function $f$.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Simple Introduction to the SiMPL Method for Density-Based Topology Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19421v2)** | 2024-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a novel method for solving density-based topology optimization problems: Sigmoidal Mirror descent with a Projected Latent variable (SiMPL). The SiMPL method (pronounced as "the simple method") optimizes a design using only first-order derivative information of the objective function. The bound constraints on the density field are enforced with the help of the (negative) Fermi--Dirac entropy, which is also used to define a non-symmetric distance function called a Bregman divergence on the set of admissible designs. This Bregman divergence leads to a simple update rule that is further simplified with the help of a so-called latent variable. Because the SiMPL method involves discretizing the latent variable, it produces a sequence of pointwise-feasible iterates, even when high-order finite elements are used in the discretization. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the method outperforms other popular first-order optimization algorithms. To outline the general applicability of the technique, we include examples with (self-load) compliance minimization and compliant mechanism optimization problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[XGrammar: Flexible and Efficient Structured Generation Engine for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15100v2)** | 2024-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The applications of LLM Agents are becoming increasingly complex and diverse, leading to a high demand for structured outputs that can be parsed into code, structured function calls, and embodied agent commands. These developments bring significant demands for structured generation in LLM inference. Context-free grammar is a flexible approach to enable structured generation via constrained decoding. However, executing context-free grammar requires going through several stack states over all tokens in vocabulary during runtime, bringing non-negligible overhead for structured generation. In this paper, we propose XGrammar, a flexible and efficient structure generation engine for large language models. XGrammar accelerates context-free grammar execution by dividing the vocabulary into context-independent tokens that can be prechecked and context-dependent tokens that need to be interpreted during runtime. We further build transformations to expand the grammar context and reduce the number of context-independent tokens. Additionally, we build an efficient persistent stack to accelerate the context-dependent token checks. Finally, we co-design the grammar engine with LLM inference engine to overlap grammar computation with GPU executions. Evaluation results show that XGrammar can achieve up to 100x speedup over existing solutions. Combined with an LLM inference engine, it can generate near-zero overhead structure generation in end-to-end low-LLM serving.</p></details> |  |

A deeper understanding of brain functionality will lead to the development of novel deep neural networks. In this work, we introduce a novel framework named Brainformer, a straightforward yet effective Transformer-based framework, to analyze Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) patterns in the human perception system from a machine-learning perspective. Specifically, we present the Multi-scale fMRI Transformer to explore brain activity patterns through fMRI signals. This architecture includes a simple yet efficient module for high-dimensional fMRI signal encoding and incorporates a novel embedding technique called 3D Voxels Embedding. Secondly, drawing inspiration from the functionality of the brain's Region of Interest, we introduce a novel loss function called Brain fMRI Guidance Loss. This loss function mimics brain activity patterns from these regions in the deep neural network using fMRI data. This work introduces a prospective approach to transferring knowledge from human perception to neural networks. Our experiments demonstrate that leveraging fMRI information allows the machine vision model to achieve results comparable to State-of-the-Art methods in various image recognition tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tracing Optimization for Performance Modeling and Regression Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17548v1)** | 2024-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software performance modeling plays a crucial role in developing and maintaining software systems. A performance model analytically describes the relationship between the performance of a system and its runtime activities. This process typically examines various aspects of a system's runtime behavior, such as the execution frequency of functions or methods, to forecast performance metrics like program execution time. By using performance models, developers can predict expected performance and thereby effectively identify and address unexpected performance regressions when actual performance deviates from the model's predictions. One common and precise method for capturing performance behavior is software tracing, which involves instrumenting the execution of a program, either at the kernel level (e.g., system calls) or application level (e.g., function calls). However, due to the nature of tracing, it can be highly resource-intensive, making it impractical for production environments where resources are limited. In this work, we propose statistical approaches to reduce tracing overhead by identifying and excluding performance-insensitive code regions, particularly application-level functions, from tracing while still building accurate performance models that can capture performance degradations. By selecting an optimal set of functions to be traced, we can construct optimized performance models that achieve an R-2 score of up to 99% and, sometimes, outperform full tracing models (models using non-optimized tracing data), while significantly reducing the tracing overhead by more than 80% in most cases. Our optimized performance models can also capture performance regressions in our studied programs effectively, demonstrating their usefulness in real-world scenarios. Our approach is fully automated, making it ready to be used in production environments with minimal human effort.</p></details> |  |
| **[An In-depth Investigation of Sparse Rate Reduction in Transformer-like Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17182v1)** | 2024-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks have long been criticized for being black-box. To unveil the inner workings of modern neural architectures, a recent work \cite{yu2024white} proposed an information-theoretic objective function called Sparse Rate Reduction (SRR) and interpreted its unrolled optimization as a Transformer-like model called Coding Rate Reduction Transformer (CRATE). However, the focus of the study was primarily on the basic implementation, and whether this objective is optimized in practice and its causal relationship to generalization remain elusive. Going beyond this study, we derive different implementations by analyzing layer-wise behaviors of CRATE, both theoretically and empirically. To reveal the predictive power of SRR on generalization, we collect a set of model variants induced by varied implementations and hyperparameters and evaluate SRR as a complexity measure based on its correlation with generalization. Surprisingly, we find out that SRR has a positive correlation coefficient and outperforms other baseline measures, such as path-norm and sharpness-based ones. Furthermore, we show that generalization can be improved using SRR as regularization on benchmark image classification datasets. We hope this paper can shed light on leveraging SRR to design principled models and study their generalization ability.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2024 |

Currently, existing models are typically based on either internal code semantics or a combination of function call graphs (CG) and internal code semantics. However, these models have limitations. Internal code semantic models only consider the semantics within the function, ignoring the inter-function semantics, making it difficult to handle situations such as function inlining. The combination of CG and internal code semantics is insufficient for addressing complex real-world scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose BinEnhance, a novel framework designed to leverage the inter-function semantics to enhance the expression of internal code semantics for binary code search. Specifically, BinEnhance constructs an External Environment Semantic Graph (EESG), which establishes a stable and analogous external environment for homologous functions by using different inter-function semantic relations (e.g., call, location, data-co-use). After the construction of EESG, we utilize the embeddings generated by existing internal code semantic models to initialize nodes of EESG. Finally, we design a Semantic Enhancement Model (SEM) that uses Relational Graph Convolutional Networks (RGCNs) and a residual block to learn valuable external semantics on the EESG for generating the enhanced semantics embedding. In addition, BinEnhance utilizes data feature similarity to refine the cosine similarity of semantic embeddings. We conduct experiments under six different tasks (e.g., under function inlining scenario) and the results illustrate the performance and robustness of BinEnhance. The application of BinEnhance to HermesSim, Asm2vec, TREX, Gemini, and Asteria on two public datasets results in an improvement of Mean Average Precision (MAP) from 53.6% to 69.7%. Moreover, the efficiency increases fourfold.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Network and Distributed System Security (NDSS) Symposium 2025 fall cycle</p></details> |
| **[Solving Multi-Group Neutron Diffusion Eigenvalue Problem with Decoupling Residual Loss Function](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15693v1)** | 2024-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the midst of the neural network's success in solving partial differential equations, tackling eigenvalue problems using neural networks remains a challenging task. However, the Physics Constrained-General Inverse Power Method Neural Network (PC-GIPMNN) approach was proposed and successfully applied to solve the single-group critical problems in reactor physics. This paper aims to solve critical problems in multi-group scenarios and in more complex geometries. Hence, inspired by the merits of traditional source iterative method, which can overcome the ill-condition of the right side of the equations effectively and solve the multi-group problem effectively, we propose two residual loss function called Decoupling Residual loss function and Direct Iterative loss function. Our loss function can deal with multi-group eigenvalue problem, and also single-group eigenvalue problem. Using the new residual loss functions, our study solves one-dimensional, two-dimensional, and three-dimensional multi-group problems in nuclear reactor physics without prior data. In numerical experiments, our approach demonstrates superior generalization capabilities compared to previous work.</p></details> |  |
| **[Less is More: Optimizing Function Calling for LLM Execution on Edge Devices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15399v1)** | 2024-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advanced function-calling capabilities of foundation models open up new possibilities for deploying agents to perform complex API tasks. However, managing large amounts of data and interacting with numerous APIs makes function calling hardware-intensive and costly, especially on edge devices. Current Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with function calling at the edge because they cannot handle complex inputs or manage multiple tools effectively. This results in low task-completion accuracy, increased delays, and higher power consumption. In this work, we introduce Less-is-More, a novel fine-tuning-free function-calling scheme for dynamic tool selection. Our approach is based on the key insight that selectively reducing the number of tools available to LLMs significantly improves their function-calling performance, execution time, and power efficiency on edge devices. Experimental results with state-of-the-art LLMs on edge hardware show agentic success rate improvements, with execution time reduced by up to 70% and power consumption by up to 40%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at DATE 2025</p></details> |

We categorize the models' outputs in tool-use dialogs into four distinct types: Tool Call, Answer Completion, Slot Question, and Relevance Detection, which serve as aspects for evaluation. We introduce FunctionChat-Bench, comprising 700 evaluation items and automated assessment programs. Using this benchmark, we evaluate several language models that support function calling. Our findings indicate that while language models may exhibit high accuracy in single-turn Tool Call scenarios, this does not necessarily translate to superior generative performance in multi-turn environments. We argue that the capabilities required for function calling extend beyond generating tool call messages; they must also effectively generate conversational messages that engage the user.</p></details> | 8 pages |

Timely and precise diagnoses are crucial since delays might significantly impact patient health outcomes. This research presents a novel deep-learning architecture that aims to diagnose heart abnormalities quickly and accurately. We devised a new activation function called aSoftMax, designed to improve the visibility of ECG deflections. The proposed activation function is used with Convolutional Neural Network architecture to includes kernel weight sharing across the ECG's various leads. This innovative method thoroughly generalizes the global 12-lead ECG features and minimizes the model's complexity by decreasing the trainable parameters. aSoftMax, combined with enhanced CNN architecture yielded AmpliNetECG12, we obtain exceptional accuracy of 84% in diagnosing cardiac disorders. AmpliNetECG12 shows outstanding prediction ability when used with the CPSC2018 dataset for arrhythmia classification. The model attains an F1-score of 80.71% and a ROC-AUC score of 96.00%, with 280,000 trainable parameters which signifies the lightweight yet efficient nature of AmpliNetECG12. The stochastic characteristics of aSoftMax, a fundamental element of AmpliNetECG12, improve prediction accuracy and also increasse the model's interpretability. This feature enhances comprehension of important ECG segments in different forms of arrhythmias, establishing a new standard of explainable architecture for cardiac disorder classification.</p></details> |  |
| **[FlexFL: Flexible and Effective Fault Localization with Open-Source Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10714v1)** | 2024-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the impressive code comprehension ability of Large Language Models (LLMs), a few studies have proposed to leverage LLMs to locate bugs, i.e., LLM-based FL, and demonstrated promising performance. However, first, these methods are limited in flexibility. They rely on bug-triggering test cases to perform FL and cannot make use of other available bug-related information, e.g., bug reports. Second, they are built upon proprietary LLMs, which are, although powerful, confronted with risks in data privacy. To address these limitations, we propose a novel LLM-based FL framework named FlexFL, which can flexibly leverage different types of bug-related information and effectively work with open-source LLMs. FlexFL is composed of two stages. In the first stage, FlexFL reduces the search space of buggy code using state-of-the-art FL techniques of different families and provides a candidate list of bug-related methods. In the second stage, FlexFL leverages LLMs to delve deeper to double-check the code snippets of methods suggested by the first stage and refine fault localization results. In each stage, FlexFL constructs agents based on open-source LLMs, which share the same pipeline that does not postulate any type of bug-related information and can interact with function calls without the out-of-the-box capability. Extensive experimental results on Defects4J demonstrate that FlexFL outperforms the baselines and can work with different open-source LLMs. Specifically, FlexFL with a lightweight open-source LLM Llama3-8B can locate 42 and 63 more bugs than two state-of-the-art LLM-based FL approaches AutoFL and AgentFL that both use GPT-3.5.</p></details> | 14 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Prompting and Fine-tuning Large Language Models for Automated Code Review Comment Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10129v1)** | 2024-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating accurate code review comments remains a significant challenge due to the inherently diverse and non-unique nature of the task output. Large language models pretrained on both programming and natural language data tend to perform well in code-oriented tasks. However, large-scale pretraining is not always feasible due to its environmental impact and project-specific generalizability issues. In this work, first we fine-tune open-source Large language models (LLM) in parameter-efficient, quantized low-rank (QLoRA) fashion on consumer-grade hardware to improve review comment generation. Recent studies demonstrate the efficacy of augmenting semantic metadata information into prompts to boost performance in other code-related tasks. To explore this in code review activities, we also prompt proprietary, closed-source LLMs augmenting the input code patch with function call graphs and code summaries. Both of our strategies improve the review comment generation performance, with function call graph augmented few-shot prompting on the GPT-3.5 model surpassing the pretrained baseline by around 90% BLEU-4 score on the CodeReviewer dataset. Moreover, few-shot prompted Gemini-1.0 Pro, QLoRA fine-tuned Code Llama and Llama 3.1 models achieve competitive results (ranging from 25% to 83% performance improvement) on this task. An additional human evaluation study further validates our experimental findings, reflecting real-world developers' perceptions of LLM-generated code review comments based on relevant qualitative metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[LeapFrog: The Rowhammer Instruction Skip Attack](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07878v2)** | 2024-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Since its inception, Rowhammer exploits have rapidly evolved into increasingly sophisticated threats compromising data integrity and the control flow integrity of victim processes. Nevertheless, it remains a challenge for an attacker to identify vulnerable targets (i.e., Rowhammer gadgets), understand the outcome of the attempted fault, and formulate an attack that yields useful results. In this paper, we present a new type of Rowhammer gadget, called a LeapFrog gadget, which, when present in the victim code, allows an adversary to subvert code execution to bypass a critical piece of code (e.g., authentication check logic, encryption rounds, padding in security protocols). The LeapFrog gadget manifests when the victim code stores the Program Counter (PC) value in the user or kernel stack (e.g., a return address during a function call) which, when tampered with, repositions the return address to a location that bypasses a security-critical code pattern. This research also presents a systematic process to identify LeapFrog gadgets. This methodology enables the automated detection of susceptible targets and the determination of optimal attack parameters. We first show the attack on a decision tree algorithm to show the potential implications. Secondly, we employ the attack on OpenSSL to bypass the encryption and reveal the plaintext. We then use our tools to scan the Open Quantum Safe library and report on the number of LeapFrog gadgets in the code. Lastly, we demonstrate this new attack vector through a practical demonstration in a client/server TLS handshake scenario, successfully inducing an instruction skip in a client application. Our findings extend the impact of Rowhammer attacks on control flow and contribute to developing more robust defenses against these increasingly sophisticated threats.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Hardware.io 2024</p></details> |

However, challenges such as data scarcity, ineffective question formatting, and catastrophic forgetting hinder the development of on-device LLM agents. To tackle these issues, we propose Alopex, a framework that enables precise on-device function calls using the Fox LLM. Alopex introduces a logic-based method for generating high-quality training data and a novel ``description-question-output'' format for fine-tuning, reducing risks of function information leakage. Additionally, a data mixing strategy is used to mitigate catastrophic forgetting, combining function call data with textbook datasets to enhance performance in various tasks. Experimental results show that Alopex improves function call accuracy and significantly reduces catastrophic forgetting, providing a robust solution for integrating function call capabilities into LLMs without manual intervention.</p></details> |  |

Traditional approaches to metric learning, whether based on distance or margin metrics, primarily emphasize class separation, often overlooking the intra-class distribution essential for multi-modal feature learning. In this context, we propose a novel loss function called Density-Aware Adaptive Margin Loss(DAAL), which preserves the density distribution of embeddings while encouraging the formation of adaptive sub-clusters within each class. By employing an adaptive line strategy, DAAL not only enhances intra-class variance but also ensures robust inter-class separation, facilitating effective multi-modal representation. Comprehensive experiments on benchmark fine-grained datasets demonstrate the superior performance of DAAL, underscoring its potential in advancing retrieval applications and multi-modal deep metric learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 4 fugues, 2 tables</p></details> |

This function that supervises learning is a frequently unrecognized hyperparameter that determines how incorrect outputs are penalized and can be tuned to improve performance. This paper shows that training speed and final accuracy of neural networks can significantly depend on the loss function used to train neural networks. In particular derivative values can be significantly different with different loss functions leading to significantly different performance after gradient descent based Backpropagation (BP) training. This paper explores the effect on performance of using new loss functions that are also convex but penalize errors differently compared to the popular Cross-entropy loss. Two new classification loss functions that significantly improve performance on a wide variety of benchmark tasks are proposed. A new loss function call smooth absolute error that outperforms the Squared error, Huber and Log-Cosh losses on datasets with significantly many outliers is proposed. This smooth absolute error loss function is infinitely differentiable and more closely approximates the absolute error loss compared to the Huber and Log-Cosh losses used for robust regression.</p></details> |  |
| **[CRMArena: Understanding the Capacity of LLM Agents to Perform Professional CRM Tasks in Realistic Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02305v1)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems are vital for modern enterprises, providing a foundation for managing customer interactions and data. Integrating AI agents into CRM systems can automate routine processes and enhance personalized service. However, deploying and evaluating these agents is challenging due to the lack of realistic benchmarks that reflect the complexity of real-world CRM tasks. To address this issue, we introduce CRMArena, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate AI agents on realistic tasks grounded in professional work environments. Following guidance from CRM experts and industry best practices, we designed CRMArena with nine customer service tasks distributed across three personas: service agent, analyst, and manager. The benchmark includes 16 commonly used industrial objects (e.g., account, order, knowledge article, case) with high interconnectivity, along with latent variables (e.g., complaint habits, policy violations) to simulate realistic data distributions. Experimental results reveal that state-of-the-art LLM agents succeed in less than 40% of the tasks with ReAct prompting, and less than 55% even with function-calling abilities. Our findings highlight the need for enhanced agent capabilities in function-calling and rule-following to be deployed in real-world work environments. CRMArena is an open challenge to the community: systems that can reliably complete tasks showcase direct business value in a popular work environment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to Reason via Program Generation, Emulation, and Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16337v3)** | 2024-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Program synthesis with language models (LMs) has unlocked a large set of reasoning abilities; code-tuned LMs have proven adept at generating programs that solve a wide variety of algorithmic symbolic manipulation tasks (e.g. word concatenation). However, not all reasoning tasks are easily expressible as code, e.g. tasks involving commonsense reasoning, moral decision-making, and sarcasm understanding. Our goal is to extend an LM's program synthesis skills to such tasks and evaluate the results via pseudo-programs, namely Python programs where some leaf function calls are left undefined. To that end, we propose, Code Generation and Emulated EXecution (CoGEX). CoGEX works by (1) training LMs to generate pseudo-programs, (2) teaching them to emulate their generated program's execution, including those leaf functions, allowing the LM's knowledge to fill in the execution gaps; and (3) using them to search over many programs to find an optimal one. To adapt the CoGEX model to a new task, we introduce a method for performing program search to find a single program whose pseudo-execution yields optimal performance when applied to all the instances of a given dataset. We show that our approach yields large improvements compared to standard in-context learning approaches on a battery of tasks, both algorithmic and soft reasoning. This result thus demonstrates that code synthesis can be applied to a much broader class of problems than previously considered. Our released dataset, fine-tuned models, and implementation can be found at \url{https://github.com/nweir127/CoGEX}.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024 camera ready</p></details> |

However, existing approaches have limitations in handling conditional logic, integrating knowledge sources, and consistently following instructions. Researchers and industry professionals often employ ad hoc pipelines to construct conversational agents. These pipelines aim to maintain context, address failure cases, and minimize hallucinations, yet frequently fail to achieve these objectives. To this end, we present Genie - a programmable framework for creating task-oriented conversational agents that are designed to handle complex user interactions and knowledge queries. Unlike LLMs, Genie provides reliable grounded responses, with controllable agent policies through its expressive specification, Genie Worksheet. In contrast to dialog trees, it is resilient to diverse user queries, helpful with knowledge sources, and offers ease of programming policies through its declarative paradigm. The agents built using Genie outperforms the state-of-the-art method on complex logic domains in STARV2 dataset by up to 20.5%. Additionally, through a real-user study involving 62 participants, we show that Genie beats the GPT-4 with function calling baseline by 21.1%, 20.1%, and 61% on execution accuracy, dialogue act accuracy, and goal completion rate, respectively, on three diverse real-world domains</p></details> | preprint |
| **[Proto-Quipper with Reversing and Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22261v1)** | 2024-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The quantum programming language Quipper supports circuit operations such as reversing and control, which allows programmers to control and reverse certain quantum circuits. In addition to these two operations, Quipper provides a function called with-computed, which can be used to program circuits of the form $g; f; g^{\dagger}$. The latter is a common pattern in quantum circuit design. One benefit of using with-computed, as opposed to constructing the circuit $g ; f; g^{\dagger}$ directly from $g$, $f$, and $g^{\dagger}$, is that it facilitates an important optimization. Namely, if the resulting circuit is later controlled, only the circuit $f$ in the middle needs to be controlled; the circuits $g$ and $g^{\dagger}$ need not even be controllable. In this paper, we formalize a semantics for reversible and controllable circuits, using a dagger symmetric monoidal category $\mathbf{R}$ to interpret reversible circuits, and a new notion we call a controllable category $\mathbf{N}$ to interpret controllable circuits. The controllable category $\mathbf{N}$ encompasses the control and with-computed operations in Quipper. We extend the language Proto-Quipper with reversing, control and the with-computed operation. Since not all circuits are reversible and/or controllable, we use a type system with modalities to track reversibility and controllability. This generalizes the modality of Fu-Kishida-Ross-Selinger 2023. We give an abstract categorical semantics for reversing, control and with-computed, and show that the type system and operational semantics are sound with respect to this semantics. Lastly, we construct a concrete model using a generalization of biset enrichment from Fu-Kishida-Ross-Selinger 2022.</p></details> |  |

Showcasing the application of our methodology, we introduce the Minecraft Persona-driven Dialogue dataset (MCPDial). Starting with a small seed of expert-written conversations, we employ our method to generate hundreds of additional conversations. Each conversation in the dataset includes rich character descriptions of the player and NPC. The conversations are long, allowing for in-depth and extensive interactions between the player and NPC. MCPDial extends beyond basic conversations by incorporating canonical function calls (e.g. "Call find a resource on iron ore") between the utterances. Finally, we conduct a qualitative analysis of the dataset to assess its quality and characteristics.</p></details> |  |

However, their capability to perform inference based on user-specified structured data and knowledge in corpus-rare concepts, such as causal decision-making is still limited. In this work, we explore the possibility of fine-tuning an open-sourced LLM into LLM4Causal, which can identify the causal task, execute a corresponding function, and interpret its numerical results based on users' queries and the provided dataset. Meanwhile, we propose a data generation process for more controllable GPT prompting and present two instruction-tuning datasets: (1) Causal-Retrieval-Bench for causal problem identification and input parameter extraction for causal function calling and (2) Causal-Interpret-Bench for in-context causal interpretation. By conducting end-to-end evaluations and two ablation studies, we showed that LLM4Causal can deliver end-to-end solutions for causal problems and provide easy-to-understand answers, which significantly outperforms the baselines.</p></details> | Accepted by COLM2024 |
| **[An LLM Agent for Automatic Geospatial Data Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18792v2)** | 2024-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are being used in data science code generation tasks, but they often struggle with complex sequential tasks, leading to logical errors. Their application to geospatial data processing is particularly challenging due to difficulties in incorporating complex data structures and spatial constraints, effectively utilizing diverse function calls, and the tendency to hallucinate less-used geospatial libraries. To tackle these problems, we introduce GeoAgent, a new interactive framework designed to help LLMs handle geospatial data processing more effectively. GeoAgent pioneers the integration of a code interpreter, static analysis, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques within a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm, offering a novel approach to geospatial data processing. In addition, we contribute a new benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the LLM-based approach in geospatial tasks. This benchmark leverages a variety of Python libraries and includes both single-turn and multi-turn tasks such as data acquisition, data analysis, and visualization. By offering a comprehensive evaluation among diverse geospatial contexts, this benchmark sets a new standard for developing LLM-based approaches in geospatial data analysis tasks. Our findings suggest that relying solely on knowledge of LLM is insufficient for accurate geospatial task programming, which requires coherent multi-step processes and multiple function calls. Compared to the baseline LLMs, the proposed GeoAgent has demonstrated superior performance, yielding notable improvements in function calls and task completion. In addition, these results offer valuable insights for the future development of LLM agents in automatic geospatial data analysis task programming.</p></details> |  |
| **[TinyAgent: Function Calling at the Edge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00608v3)** | 2024-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent large language models (LLMs) have enabled the development of advanced agentic systems that can integrate various tools and APIs to fulfill user queries through function calling. However, the deployment of these LLMs on the edge has not been explored since they typically require cloud-based infrastructure due to their substantial model size and computational demands. To this end, we present TinyAgent, an end-to-end framework for training and deploying task-specific small language model agents capable of function calling for driving agentic systems at the edge. We first show how to enable accurate function calling for open-source models via the LLMCompiler framework. We then systematically curate a high-quality dataset for function calling, which we use to fine-tune two small language models, TinyAgent-1.1B and 7B. For efficient inference, we introduce a novel tool retrieval method to reduce the input prompt length and utilize quantization to further accelerate the inference speed. As a driving application, we demonstrate a local Siri-like system for Apple's MacBook that can execute user commands through text or voice input. Our results show that our models can achieve, and even surpass, the function-calling capabilities of larger models like GPT-4-Turbo, while being fully deployed at the edge. We open-source our dataset, models, and installable package and provide a demo video for our MacBook assistant agent.</p></details> | EMNLP 2024 Demo |
| **[Improving Small-Scale Large Language Models Function Calling for Reasoning Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18890v1)** | 2024-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in natural language understanding and generation. While these models excel in general complex reasoning tasks, they still face challenges in mathematical problem-solving and logical reasoning. To address these limitations, researchers have explored function calling abilities, allowing LLMs to execute provided functions and utilize their outputs for task completion. However, concentrating on specific tasks can be very inefficient for large-scale LLMs to be used, because of the expensive cost of training and inference stages they need in terms of computational resources. This study introduces a novel framework for training smaller language models in function calling, focusing on specific logical and mathematical reasoning tasks. The approach aims to improve performances of small-scale models for these tasks using function calling, ensuring a high level of accuracy. Our framework employs an agent that, given a problem and a set of callable functions, queries the LLM by injecting a description and examples of the usable functions into the prompt and managing their calls in a step-by-step reasoning chain. This process is used to create a dataset of correct and incorrect reasoning chain chat completions from a large-scale LLM. This dataset is used to train a smaller LLM using Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), specifically employing the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) technique. Experimental results demonstrate how the proposed approach balances the trade-off between model size and performance, improving the ability of function calling for reasoning tasks, in smaller models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Calibrating Deep Neural Network using Euclidean Distance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18321v1)** | 2024-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Uncertainty is a fundamental aspect of real-world scenarios, where perfect information is rarely available. Humans naturally develop complex internal models to navigate incomplete data and effectively respond to unforeseen or partially observed events. In machine learning, Focal Loss is commonly used to reduce misclassification rates by emphasizing hard-to-classify samples. However, it does not guarantee well-calibrated predicted probabilities and may result in models that are overconfident or underconfident. High calibration error indicates a misalignment between predicted probabilities and actual outcomes, affecting model reliability. This research introduces a novel loss function called Focal Calibration Loss (FCL), designed to improve probability calibration while retaining the advantages of Focal Loss in handling difficult samples. By minimizing the Euclidean norm through a strictly proper loss, FCL penalizes the instance-wise calibration error and constrains bounds. We provide theoretical validation for proposed method and apply it to calibrate CheXNet for potential deployment in web-based health-care systems. Extensive evaluations on various models and datasets demonstrate that our method achieves SOTA performance in both calibration and accuracy metrics.</p></details> |  |

Shapefile, the most widely used vector data format, has become the industry standard supported by all major geographic information systems. However, processing this data typically requires specialized GIS knowledge and skills, creating a barrier for researchers from other fields and impeding interdisciplinary research in spatial data analysis. Moreover, while large language models (LLMs) have made significant advancements in natural language processing and task automation, they still face challenges in handling the complex spatial and topological relationships inherent in GIS vector data. To address these challenges, we propose ShapefileGPT, an innovative framework powered by LLMs, specifically designed to automate Shapefile tasks. ShapefileGPT utilizes a multi-agent architecture, in which the planner agent is responsible for task decomposition and supervision, while the worker agent executes the tasks. We developed a specialized function library for handling Shapefiles and provided comprehensive API documentation, enabling the worker agent to operate Shapefiles efficiently through function calling. For evaluation, we developed a benchmark dataset based on authoritative textbooks, encompassing tasks in categories such as geometric operations and spatial queries. ShapefileGPT achieved a task success rate of 95.24%, outperforming the GPT series models. In comparison to traditional LLMs, ShapefileGPT effectively handles complex vector data analysis tasks, overcoming the limitations of traditional LLMs in spatial analysis. This breakthrough opens new pathways for advancing automation and intelligence in the GIS field, with significant potential in interdisciplinary data analysis and application contexts.</p></details> |  |

A classic result on these functions, called the Leftover Hash Lemma, gives an estimate of the distance from uniformity based on the assumptions about the min-entropy of the source. We prove several results concerning extensions of this lemma to a class of functions that are $k^\ast$-universal, i.e., $l$-universal for all $2\le l\le k$. As a common distinctive feature, our results provide estimates of closeness to uniformity in terms of the $\alpha$-R\'enyi divergence for all $\alpha\in (1,\infty]$. For $1\le \alpha\le k$ we show that it is possible to convert all the randomness of the source measured in $\alpha$-R\'enyi entropy into approximately uniform bits with nearly the same amount of randomness. For large enough $k$ we show that it is possible to distill random bits that are nearly uniform, as measured by min-entropy. We also extend these results to hashing with side information.</p></details> | 24 pages |

Techniques such as data and model parallelism, gradient checkpointing, and offloading strategies address this issue but are often infeasible due to hardware constraints. To mitigate memory usage, alternative methods like Parameter-Efficient-Fine-Tuning (PEFT) and GaLore approximate weights or optimizer states. PEFT methods, such as LoRA, have gained popularity for fine-tuning LLMs, though they require a full-rank warm start. In contrast, GaLore allows full-parameter learning while being more memory-efficient. This work introduces Natural GaLore, a simple drop in replacement for AdamW, which efficiently applies the inverse Empirical Fisher Information Matrix to low-rank gradients using Woodbury's Identity. We demonstrate that incorporating second-order information speeds up optimization significantly, especially when the iteration budget is limited. Empirical pretraining on 60M, 130M, 350M, and 1.1B parameter Llama models on C4 data demonstrate significantly lower perplexity over GaLore without additional memory overhead. By fine-tuning RoBERTa on the GLUE benchmark using Natural GaLore, we demonstrate significant reduction in gap 86.05% vs 86.28% for full-finetuning. Furthermore, fine-tuning the TinyLlama 1.1B model for function calling using the TinyAgent framework shows that Natural GaLore achieving 83.09% accuracy on the TinyAgent dataset, significantly outperforms 16-bit LoRA at 80.06% and even surpasses GPT4-Turbo by 4%, all while using 30% less memory.

However, in certain situations, developers need to bypass these guarantees by using a set of unsafe features. If they are used incorrectly, these features can reintroduce the types of safety issues that Rust was designed to prevent. We seek to understand how current development tools can be improved to better assist developers who find it necessary to interact with unsafe code. To that end, we study how developers reason about foreign function calls, the limitations of the tools that they currently use, their motivations for using unsafe code, and how they reason about encapsulating it. We conducted a mixed-methods investigation consisting of semi-structured interviews with 19 developers, followed by a survey that reached an additional 160 developers. Our participants were motivated to use unsafe code when they perceived that there was no alternative, and most avoided using it. However, limited tooling support for foreign function calls made participants uncertain about their design choices, and certain foreign aliasing and concurrency patterns were difficult to encapsulate. To overcome these challenges, Rust developers need verification tools that can provide guarantees of soundness within multi-language applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>33 pa...</summary><p>33 pages with references, preprint</p></details> |

CELI addresses limitations of existing prompt engineering and workflow optimization techniques by embedding control logic directly within the operational context of language models, enabling dynamic adaptation to evolving task requirements. Our framework transfers control from the traditional programming execution environment to the LMs, allowing them to autonomously manage computational workflows while maintaining seamless interaction with external systems and functions. CELI supports arbitrary function calls with variable arguments, bridging the gap between LMs' adaptive reasoning capabilities and conventional software paradigms' structured control mechanisms. To evaluate CELI's versatility and effectiveness, we conducted case studies in two distinct domains: code generation (HumanEval benchmark) and multi-stage content generation (Wikipedia-style articles). The results demonstrate notable performance improvements across a range of domains. CELI achieved a 4.9 percentage point improvement over the best reported score of the baseline GPT-4 model on the HumanEval code generation benchmark. In multi-stage content generation, 94.4% of CELI-produced Wikipedia-style articles met or exceeded first draft quality when optimally configured, with 44.4% achieving high quality. These outcomes underscore CELI's potential for optimizing AI-driven workflows across diverse computational domains.</p></details> | 26 pages, 2 figures |

While current research on function calling by LLMs primarily focuses on single-turn interactions, this paper addresses the overlooked necessity for LLMs to engage in multi-turn function calling--critical for handling compositional, real-world queries that require planning with functions but not only use functions. To facilitate this, we introduce an approach, BUTTON, which generates synthetic compositional instruction tuning data via bottom-up instruction construction and top-down trajectory generation. In the bottom-up phase, we generate simple atomic tasks based on real-world scenarios and build compositional tasks using heuristic strategies based on atomic tasks. Corresponding functions are then developed for these compositional tasks. The top-down phase features a multi-agent environment where interactions among simulated humans, assistants, and tools are utilized to gather multi-turn function calling trajectories. This approach ensures task compositionality and allows for effective function and trajectory generation by examining atomic tasks within compositional tasks. We produce a dataset BUTTONInstruct comprising 8k data points and demonstrate its effectiveness through extensive experiments across various LLMs.</p></details> |  |

There are many DDI types (hundreds), and they are not evenly distributed with equal chance to occur. Some of the rarely occurred DDI types are often high risk and could be life-critical if overlooked, exemplifying the long-tailed distribution problem. Existing models falter against this distribution challenge and overlook the multi-faceted nature of drugs in DDI prediction. In this paper, a novel multi-modal deep learning-based framework, namely TFDM, is introduced to leverage multiple properties of a drug to achieve DDI classification. The proposed framework fuses multimodal features of drugs, including graph-based, molecular structure, Target and Enzyme, for DDI identification. To tackle the challenge posed by the distribution skewness across categories, a novel loss function called Tailed Focal Loss is introduced, aimed at further enhancing the model performance and address gradient vanishing problem of focal loss in extremely long-tailed dataset. Intensive experiments over 4 challenging long-tailed dataset demonstrate that the TFMD outperforms the most recent SOTA methods in long-tailed DDI classification tasks.

The most significant challenge is in recursive function calls, which may need to account for new cases in a combined type. We introduce bounded algebras, Mendler-style descriptions of recursive functions in which recursive calls can happen at larger types, and show that they provide expressive recursion over extensible data types.

In particular, designing molecules satisfying multi-parameter optimization objectives, while simultaneously being synthesizable and enforcing the presence of specific commercial building blocks in the synthesis. This is practically important for molecule re-purposing, sustainability, and efficiency. In this work, we propose a novel reward function called TANimoto Group Overlap (TANGO), which uses chemistry principles to transform a sparse reward function into a dense and learnable reward function -- crucial for reinforcement learning. TANGO can augment general-purpose molecular generative models to directly optimize for constrained synthesizability while simultaneously optimizing for other properties relevant to drug discovery using reinforcement learning. Our framework is general and addresses starting-material, intermediate, and divergent synthesis constraints. Contrary to most existing works in the field, we show that incentivizing a general-purpose (without any inductive biases) model is a productive approach to navigating challenging optimization scenarios. We demonstrate this by showing that the trained models explicitly learn a desirable distribution. Our framework is the first generative approach to tackle constrained synthesizability.</p></details> |  |

We introduce CAMPHOR, an innovative on-device SLM multi-agent framework designed to handle multiple user inputs and reason over personal context locally, ensuring privacy is maintained. CAMPHOR employs a hierarchical architecture where a high-order reasoning agent decomposes complex tasks and coordinates expert agents responsible for personal context retrieval, tool interaction, and dynamic plan generation. By implementing parameter sharing across agents and leveraging prompt compression, we significantly reduce model size, latency, and memory usage. To validate our approach, we present a novel dataset capturing multi-agent task trajectories centered on personalized mobile assistant use-cases. Our experiments reveal that fine-tuned SLM agents not only surpass closed-source LLMs in task completion F1 by~35\% but also eliminate the need for server-device communication, all while enhancing privacy.</p></details> |  |

| **[Elephants Never Forget: Memorization and Learning of Tabular Data in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06209v3)** | 2024-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While many have shown how Large Language Models (LLMs) can be applied to a diverse set of tasks, the critical issues of data contamination and memorization are often glossed over. In this work, we address this concern for tabular data. Specifically, we introduce a variety of different techniques to assess whether a language model has seen a tabular dataset during training. This investigation reveals that LLMs have memorized many popular tabular datasets verbatim. We then compare the few-shot learning performance of LLMs on datasets that were seen during training to the performance on datasets released after training. We find that LLMs perform better on datasets seen during training, indicating that memorization leads to overfitting. At the same time, LLMs show non-trivial performance on novel datasets and are surprisingly robust to data transformations. We then investigate the in-context statistical learning abilities of LLMs. While LLMs are significantly better than random at solving statistical classification problems, the sample efficiency of few-shot learning lags behind traditional statistical learning algorithms, especially as the dimension of the problem increases. This suggests that much of the observed few-shot performance on novel real-world datasets is due to the LLM's world knowledge. Overall, our results highlight the importance of testing whether an LLM has seen an evaluation dataset during pre-training. We release the https://github.com/interpretml/LLM-Tabular-Memorization-Checker Python package to test LLMs for memorization of tabular datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>COLM ...</summary><p>COLM camera ready, fix typo</p></details> |

Since it is impossible to generalize to a completely new and unknown domain, we study models that are easy to adapt to the target domain even with few labeled examples. We focus on building more informative representations of tabular data that can mitigate $Y|X$-shifts, and propose to leverage the prior world knowledge in LLMs by serializing (write down) the tabular data to encode it. We find LLM embeddings alone provide inconsistent improvements in robustness, but models trained on them can be well adapted/finetuned to the target domain even using 32 labeled observations. Our finding is based on a comprehensive and systematic study consisting of 7650 source-target pairs and benchmark against 261,000 model configurations trained by 22 algorithms. Our observation holds when ablating the size of accessible target data and different adaptation strategies.

| **[Elephants Never Forget: Testing Language Models for Memorization of Tabular Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06644v1)** | 2024-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While many have shown how Large Language Models (LLMs) can be applied to a diverse set of tasks, the critical issues of data contamination and memorization are often glossed over. In this work, we address this concern for tabular data. Starting with simple qualitative tests for whether an LLM knows the names and values of features, we introduce a variety of different techniques to assess the degrees of contamination, including statistical tests for conditional distribution modeling and four tests that identify memorization. Our investigation reveals that LLMs are pre-trained on many popular tabular datasets. This exposure can lead to invalid performance evaluation on downstream tasks because the LLMs have, in effect, been fit to the test set. Interestingly, we also identify a regime where the language model reproduces important statistics of the data, but fails to reproduce the dataset verbatim. On these datasets, although seen during training, good performance on downstream tasks might not be due to overfitting. Our findings underscore the need for ensuring data integrity in machine learning tasks with LLMs. To facilitate future research, we release an open-source tool that can perform various tests for memorization \url{https://github.com/interpretml/LLM-Tabular-Memorization-Checker}.</p></details> | <details><summary>Table...</summary><p>Table Representation Learning Workshop at NeurIPS 2023</p></details> |
