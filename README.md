| **[RAG Security and Privacy: Formalizing the Threat Model and Attack Surface](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20324v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an emerging approach in natural language processing that combines large language models (LLMs) with external document retrieval to produce more accurate and grounded responses. While RAG has shown strong potential in reducing hallucinations and improving factual consistency, it also introduces new privacy and security challenges that differ from those faced by traditional LLMs. Existing research has demonstrated that LLMs can leak sensitive information through training data memorization or adversarial prompts, and RAG systems inherit many of these vulnerabilities. At the same time, reliance of RAG on an external knowledge base opens new attack surfaces, including the potential for leaking information about the presence or content of retrieved documents, or for injecting malicious content to manipulate model behavior. Despite these risks, there is currently no formal framework that defines the threat landscape for RAG systems. In this paper, we address a critical gap in the literature by proposing, to the best of our knowledge, the first formal threat model for retrieval-RAG systems. We introduce a structured taxonomy of adversary types based on their access to model components and data, and we formally define key threat vectors such as document-level membership inference and data poisoning, which pose serious privacy and integrity risks in real-world deployments. By establishing formal definitions and attack models, our work lays the foundation for a more rigorous and principled understanding of privacy and security in RAG systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 5th ICDM Workshop on September 20, 2025</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing RAG Efficiency with Adaptive Context Compression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22931v3)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge but incurs significant inference costs due to lengthy retrieved contexts. While context compression mitigates this issue, existing methods apply fixed compression rates, over-compressing simple queries or under-compressing complex ones. We propose Adaptive Context Compression for RAG (ACC-RAG), a framework that dynamically adjusts compression rates based on input complexity, optimizing inference efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. ACC-RAG combines a hierarchical compressor (for multi-granular embeddings) with a context selector to retain minimal sufficient information, akin to human skimming. Evaluated on Wikipedia and five QA datasets, ACC-RAG outperforms fixed-rate methods and matches/unlocks over 4 times faster inference versus standard RAG while maintaining or improving accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Engineering RAG Systems for Real-World Applications: Design, Development, and Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20869v3)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems are emerging as a key approach for grounding Large Language Models (LLMs) in external knowledge, addressing limitations in factual accuracy and contextual relevance. However, there is a lack of empirical studies that report on the development of RAG-based implementations grounded in real-world use cases, evaluated through general user involvement, and accompanied by systematic documentation of lessons learned. This paper presents five domain-specific RAG applications developed for real-world scenarios across governance, cybersecurity, agriculture, industrial research, and medical diagnostics. Each system incorporates multilingual OCR, semantic retrieval via vector embeddings, and domain-adapted LLMs, deployed through local servers or cloud APIs to meet distinct user needs. A web-based evaluation involving a total of 100 participants assessed the systems across six dimensions: (i) Ease of Use, (ii) Relevance, (iii) Transparency, (iv) Responsiveness, (v) Accuracy, and (vi) Likelihood of Recommendation. Based on user feedback and our development experience, we documented twelve key lessons learned, highlighting technical, operational, and ethical challenges affecting the reliability and usability of RAG systems in practice.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the Proceedings of the 51st Euromicro Conference on Software Engineering and Advanced Applications, SEAA 2025.

| **[HawkBench: Investigating Resilience of RAG Methods on Stratified Information-Seeking Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13465v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In real-world information-seeking scenarios, users have dynamic and diverse needs, requiring RAG systems to demonstrate adaptable resilience. To comprehensively evaluate the resilience of current RAG methods, we introduce HawkBench, a human-labeled, multi-domain benchmark designed to rigorously assess RAG performance across categorized task types. By stratifying tasks based on information-seeking behaviors, HawkBench provides a systematic evaluation of how well RAG systems adapt to diverse user needs. Unlike existing benchmarks, which focus primarily on specific task types (mostly factoid queries) and rely on varying knowledge bases, HawkBench offers: (1) systematic task stratification to cover a broad range of query types, including both factoid and rationale queries, (2) integration of multi-domain corpora across all task types to mitigate corpus bias, and (3) rigorous annotation for high-quality evaluation. HawkBench includes 1,600 high-quality test samples, evenly distributed across domains and task types. Using this benchmark, we evaluate representative RAG methods, analyzing their performance in terms of answer quality and response latency. Our findings highlight the need for dynamic task strategies that integrate decision-making, query interpretation, and global knowledge understanding to improve RAG generalizability. We believe HawkBench serves as a pivotal benchmark for advancing the resilience of RAG methods and their ability to achieve general-purpose information seeking.</p></details> | <details><summary>Neuri...</summary><p>Neurips 25 DB Track, Spotlight</p></details> |
| **[On The Reproducibility Limitations of RAG Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18869v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is increasingly employed in generative AI-driven scientific workflows to integrate rapidly evolving scientific knowledge bases, yet its reliability is frequently compromised by non-determinism in their retrieval components. This paper introduces ReproRAG, a comprehensive benchmarking framework designed to systematically measure and quantify the reproducibility of vector-based retrieval systems. ReproRAG investigates sources of uncertainty across the entire pipeline, including different embedding models, precision, retrieval algorithms, hardware configurations, and distributed execution environments. Utilizing a suite of metrics, such as Exact Match Rate, Jaccard Similarity, and Kendall's Tau, the proposed framework effectively characterizes the trade-offs between reproducibility and performance. Our large-scale empirical study reveals critical insights; for instance, we observe that different embedding models have remarkable impact on RAG reproducibility. The open-sourced ReproRAG framework provides researchers and engineers productive tools to validate deployments, benchmark reproducibility, and make informed design decisions, thereby fostering more trustworthy AI for science.</p></details> |  |
| **[Speaking at the Right Level: Literacy-Controlled Counterspeech Generation with RAG-RL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01058v3)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Health misinformation spreading online poses a significant threat to public health. Researchers have explored methods for automatically generating counterspeech to health misinformation as a mitigation strategy. Existing approaches often produce uniform responses, ignoring that the health literacy level of the audience could affect the accessibility and effectiveness of counterspeech. We propose a Controlled-Literacy framework using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with reinforcement learning (RL) to generate tailored counterspeech adapted to different health literacy levels. In particular, we retrieve knowledge aligned with specific health literacy levels, enabling accessible and factual information to support generation. We design a reward function incorporating subjective user preferences and objective readability-based rewards to optimize counterspeech to the target health literacy level. Experiment results show that Controlled-Literacy outperforms baselines by generating more accessible and user-preferred counterspeech. This research contributes to more equitable and impactful public health communication by improving the accessibility and comprehension of counterspeech to health misinformation</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Findings of EMNLP 2025</p></details> |
| **[Turk-LettuceDetect: A Hallucination Detection Models for Turkish RAG Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17671v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) has been hindered by their tendency to hallucinate, generating plausible but factually incorrect information. While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems attempt to address this issue by grounding responses in external knowledge, hallucination remains a persistent challenge, particularly for morphologically complex, low-resource languages like Turkish. This paper introduces Turk-LettuceDetect, the first suite of hallucination detection models specifically designed for Turkish RAG applications. Building on the LettuceDetect framework, we formulate hallucination detection as a token-level classification task and fine-tune three distinct encoder architectures: a Turkish-specific ModernBERT, TurkEmbed4STS, and multilingual EuroBERT. These models were trained on a machine-translated version of the RAGTruth benchmark dataset containing 17,790 instances across question answering, data-to-text generation, and summarization tasks. Our experimental results show that the ModernBERT-based model achieves an F1-score of 0.7266 on the complete test set, with particularly strong performance on structured tasks. The models maintain computational efficiency while supporting long contexts up to 8,192 tokens, making them suitable for real-time deployment. Comparative analysis reveals that while state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate high recall, they suffer from low precision due to over-generation of hallucinated content, underscoring the necessity of specialized detection mechanisms. By releasing our models and translated dataset, this work addresses a critical gap in multilingual NLP and establishes a foundation for developing more reliable and trustworthy AI applications for Turkish and other languages.</p></details> |  |
| **[UR$^2$: Unify RAG and Reasoning through Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06165v3)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities through two complementary paradigms: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which enhances knowledge grounding, and Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), which optimizes complex reasoning abilities. However, these two capabilities are often developed in isolation, and existing efforts to unify them remain narrow in scope -- typically limited to open-domain QA with fixed retrieval settings and task-specific constraints. This lack of integration constrains generalization and limits the applicability of RAG-RL methods to broader domains. To bridge this gap, we propose UR2 (Unified RAG and Reasoning), a general framework that unifies retrieval and reasoning through reinforcement learning. UR2 introduces two key contributions: a difficulty-aware curriculum training that selectively invokes retrieval only for challenging problems, and a hybrid knowledge access strategy combining domain-specific offline corpora with LLM-generated summaries. These components are designed to enable dynamic coordination between retrieval and reasoning, improving adaptability across a diverse range of tasks. Experiments across open-domain QA, MMLU-Pro, medical, and mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrate that UR$^2$ (built on Qwen-2.5-3/7B and LLaMA-3.1-8B) significantly outperforms existing RAG and RL methods, achieving comparable performance to GPT-4o-mini and GPT-4.1-mini on several benchmarks. We have released all code, models, and data at https://github.com/Tsinghua-dhy/UR2.</p></details> |  |
| **[EviNote-RAG: Enhancing RAG Models via Answer-Supportive Evidence Notes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00877v2)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has advanced open-domain question answering by incorporating external information into model reasoning. However, effectively leveraging external information to enhance reasoning presents the following challenges: (1) low signal-to-noise ratio, where answer-supportive external information is diluted by irrelevant material, and (2) error accumulation, which arises in multi-hop reasoning when incomplete or misleading information is incorporated. To address these challenges, we introduce EviNote-RAG, a framework that follows a retrieve-note-answer workflow. Instead of reasoning directly over raw external information, the model first produces Supportive-Evidence Notes (SENs), which concisely preserve answer-critical information and explicitly mark key and uncertainty information to improve accuracy. We further design an entailment-based Evidence Quality Reward (EQR) to ensure that SENs are logically sufficient to derive the final answer, thereby enhancing SENs' quality. Experiments on both in-domain and out-of-domain QA benchmarks show that EviNote-RAG achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving answer accuracy, training stability, robustness, and efficiency. In particular, it yields relative F1 gains of 20% on HotpotQA (+0.093), 40% on Bamboogle (+0.151), and 91% on 2Wiki (+0.256), benefiting from improvements in the reasoning process.</p></details> |  |
| **[Agentic AI with Orchestrator-Agent Trust: A Modular Visual Classification Framework with Trust-Aware Orchestration and RAG-Based Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10571v3)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern Artificial Intelligence (AI) increasingly relies on multi-agent architectures that blend visual and language understanding. Yet, a pressing challenge remains: How can we trust these agents especially in zero-shot settings with no fine-tuning? We introduce a novel modular Agentic AI visual classification framework that integrates generalist multimodal agents with a non-visual reasoning orchestrator and a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) module. Applied to apple leaf disease diagnosis, we benchmark three configurations: (I) zero-shot with confidence-based orchestration, (II) fine-tuned agents with improved performance, and (III) trust-calibrated orchestration enhanced by CLIP-based image retrieval and re-evaluation loops. Using confidence calibration metrics (ECE, OCR, CCC), the orchestrator modulates trust across agents. Our results demonstrate a 77.94\% accuracy improvement in the zero-shot setting using trust-aware orchestration and RAG, achieving 85.63\% overall. GPT-4o showed better calibration, while Qwen-2.5-VL displayed overconfidence. Furthermore, image-RAG grounded predictions with visually similar cases, enabling correction of agent overconfidence via iterative re-evaluation. The proposed system separates perception (vision agents) from meta-reasoning (orchestrator), enabling scalable and interpretable multi-agent AI. This blueprint illustrates how Agentic AI can deliver trustworthy, modular, and transparent reasoning, and is extensible to diagnostics, biology, and other trust-critical domains. In doing so, we highlight Agentic AI not just as an architecture but as a paradigm for building reliable multi-agent intelligence. agentic ai, orchestrator agent trust, trust orchestration, visual classification, retrieval augmented reasoning</p></details> |  |
| **[Comparing RAG and GraphRAG for Page-Level Retrieval Question Answering on Math Textbook](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16780v1)** | 2025-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Technology-enhanced learning environments often help students retrieve relevant learning content for questions arising during self-paced study. Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as novel aids for information retrieval during learning. While LLMs are effective for general-purpose question-answering, they typically lack alignment with the domain knowledge of specific course materials such as textbooks and slides. We investigate Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and GraphRAG, a knowledge graph-enhanced RAG approach, for page-level question answering in an undergraduate mathematics textbook. While RAG has been effective for retrieving discrete, contextually relevant passages, GraphRAG may excel in modeling interconnected concepts and hierarchical knowledge structures. We curate a dataset of 477 question-answer pairs, each tied to a distinct textbook page. We then compare the standard embedding-based RAG methods to GraphRAG for evaluating both retrieval accuracy-whether the correct page is retrieved-and generated answer quality via F1 scores. Our findings show that embedding-based RAG achieves higher retrieval accuracy and better F1 scores compared to GraphRAG, which tends to retrieve excessive and sometimes irrelevant content due to its entity-based structure. We also explored re-ranking the retrieved pages with LLM and observed mixed results, including performance drop and hallucinations when dealing with larger context windows. Overall, this study highlights both the promises and challenges of page-level retrieval systems in educational contexts, emphasizing the need for more refined retrieval methods to build reliable AI tutoring solutions in providing reference page numbers.</p></details> |  |

A simple recency prior achieved an accuracy of 1.00 on freshness tasks. In contrast, a clustering heuristic for topic evolution failed (0.08 F1-score), showing trend detection requires methods beyond simple heuristics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Financial RAG with Agentic AI and Multi-HyDE: A Novel Approach to Knowledge Retrieval and Hallucination Reduction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16369v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate and reliable knowledge retrieval is vital for financial question-answering, where continually updated data sources and complex, high-stakes contexts demand precision. Traditional retrieval systems rely on a single database and retriever, but financial applications require more sophisticated approaches to handle intricate regulatory filings, market analyses, and extensive multi-year reports. We introduce a framework for financial Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) that leverages agentic AI and the Multi-HyDE system, an approach that generates multiple, nonequivalent queries to boost the effectiveness and coverage of retrieval from large, structured financial corpora. Our pipeline is optimized for token efficiency and multi-step financial reasoning, and we demonstrate that their combination improves accuracy by 11.2% and reduces hallucinations by 15%. Our method is evaluated on standard financial QA benchmarks, showing that integrating domain-specific retrieval mechanisms such as Multi-HyDE with robust toolsets, including keyword and table-based retrieval, significantly enhances both the accuracy and reliability of answers. This research not only delivers a modular, adaptable retrieval framework for finance but also highlights the importance of structured agent workflows and multi-perspective retrieval for trustworthy deployment of AI in high-stakes financial applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 Pa...</summary><p>14 Pages, 8 Tables, 2 Figures.

Answering the questions is an opportunity for authors to reflect on their work and make sure any shared scientific assets follow best practices. Ideally, considering a checklist before submission can favorably impact the writing of a research paper. However, previous research has shown that self-reported checklist responses don't always accurately represent papers. In this work, we introduce ConfReady, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) application that can be used to empower authors to reflect on their work and assist authors with conference checklists. To evaluate checklist assistants, we curate a dataset of 1,975 ACL checklist responses, analyze problems in human answers, and benchmark RAG and Large Language Model (LM) based systems on an evaluation subset. Our code is released under the AGPL-3.0 license on GitHub, with documentation covering the user interface and PyPI package.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP 2025 Demo</p></details> |
| **[Causal-Counterfactual RAG: The Integration of Causal-Counterfactual Reasoning into RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14435v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have transformed natural language processing (NLP), enabling diverse applications by integrating large-scale pre-trained knowledge. However, their static knowledge limits dynamic reasoning over external information, especially in knowledge-intensive domains. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this challenge by combining retrieval mechanisms with generative modeling to improve contextual understanding. Traditional RAG systems suffer from disrupted contextual integrity due to text chunking and over-reliance on semantic similarity for retrieval, often resulting in shallow and less accurate responses. We propose Causal-Counterfactual RAG, a novel framework that integrates explicit causal graphs representing cause-effect relationships into the retrieval process and incorporates counterfactual reasoning grounded on the causal structure. Unlike conventional methods, our framework evaluates not only direct causal evidence but also the counterfactuality of associated causes, combining results from both to generate more robust, accurate, and interpretable answers. By leveraging causal pathways and associated hypothetical scenarios, Causal-Counterfactual RAG preserves contextual coherence, reduces hallucination, and enhances reasoning fidelity.</p></details> |  |
| **[TAI Scan Tool: A RAG-Based Tool With Minimalistic Input for Trustworthy AI Self-Assessment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17514v2)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces the TAI Scan Tool, a RAG-based TAI self-assessment tool with minimalistic input. The current version of the tool supports the legal TAI assessment, with a particular emphasis on facilitating compliance with the AI Act. It involves a two-step approach with a pre-screening and an assessment phase. The assessment output of the system includes insight regarding the risk-level of the AI system according to the AI Act, while at the same time retrieving relevant articles to aid with compliance and notify on their obligations. Our qualitative evaluation using use-case scenarios yields promising results, correctly predicting risk levels while retrieving relevant articles across three distinct semantic groups. Furthermore, interpretation of results shows that the tool's reasoning relies on comparison with the setting of high-risk systems, a behaviour attributed to their deployment requiring careful consideration, and therefore frequently presented within the AI Act.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 1 figure, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[SIRAG: Towards Stable and Interpretable RAG with A Process-Supervised Multi-Agent Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18167v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enables large language models (LLMs) to access external knowledge sources, but the effectiveness of RAG relies on the coordination between the retriever and the generator. Since these components are developed independently, their interaction is often suboptimal: the retriever may return irrelevant or redundant documents, while the generator may fail to fully leverage retrieved evidence. In this work, we propose a process-supervised multi-agent framework to bridge the gap between retriever and generator. The framework introduces two lightweight agents: a Decision Maker, which determines when to continue retrieval or stop for answer generation, and a Knowledge Selector, which filters retrieved documents to retain only the most useful evidence. To provide fine-grained supervision, we employ an LLM-as-a-Judge that evaluates each intermediate action with process-level rewards, ensuring more accurate credit assignment than relying solely on final answer correctness. We further adopt a tree-structured rollout strategy to explore diverse reasoning paths, and train both agents with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) in an end-to-end manner. Experiments on single-hop and multi-hop question answering benchmarks show that our approach achieves higher accuracy, more stable convergence, and produces more interpretable reasoning trajectories compared with standard RAG baselines. Importantly, the proposed framework is modular and plug-and-play, requiring no modification to the retriever or generator, making it practical for real-world RAG applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages,2 figures, IRAC under review</p></details> |
| **[Clue-RAG: Towards Accurate and Cost-Efficient Graph-based RAG via Multi-Partite Graph and Query-Driven Iterative Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08445v3)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the remarkable progress of Large Language Models (LLMs), their performance in question answering (QA) remains limited by the lack of domain-specific and up-to-date knowledge. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this limitation by incorporating external information, often from graph-structured data. However, existing graph-based RAG methods suffer from poor graph quality due to incomplete extraction and insufficient utilization of query information during retrieval. To overcome these limitations, we propose Clue-RAG, a novel approach that introduces (1) a multi-partite graph index incorporates Chunk, knowledge unit, and entity to capture semantic content at multiple levels of granularity, coupled with a hybrid extraction strategy that reduces LLM token usage while still producing accurate and disambiguated knowledge units, and (2) Q-Iter, a query-driven iterative retrieval strategy that enhances relevance through semantic search and constrained graph traversal. Experiments on three QA benchmarks show that Clue-RAG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to 99.33% higher Accuracy and 113.51% higher F1 score while reducing indexing costs by 72.58%. Remarkably, Clue-RAG matches or outperforms baselines even without using an LLM for indexing. These results demonstrate the effectiveness and cost-efficiency of Clue-RAG in advancing graph-based RAG systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[RAGs to Riches: RAG-like Few-shot Learning for Large Language Model Role-playing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12168v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Role-playing Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-stakes domains such as healthcare, education, and governance, where failures can directly impact user trust and well-being. A cost effective paradigm for LLM role-playing is few-shot learning, but existing approaches often cause models to break character in unexpected and potentially harmful ways, especially when interacting with hostile users. Inspired by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), we reformulate LLM role-playing into a text retrieval problem and propose a new prompting framework called RAGs-to-Riches, which leverages curated reference demonstrations to condition LLM responses. We evaluate our framework with LLM-as-a-judge preference voting and introduce two novel token-level ROUGE metrics: Intersection over Output (IOO) to quantity how much an LLM improvises and Intersection over References (IOR) to measure few-shot demonstrations utilization rate during the evaluation tasks. When simulating interactions with a hostile user, our prompting strategy incorporates in its responses during inference an average of 35% more tokens from the reference demonstrations. As a result, across 453 role-playing interactions, our models are consistently judged as being more authentic, and remain in-character more often than zero-shot and in-context Learning (ICL) methods. Our method presents a scalable strategy for building robust, human-aligned LLM role-playing frameworks.</p></details> |  |

| **[First RAG, Second SEG: A Training-Free Paradigm for Camouflaged Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15313v2)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Camouflaged object detection (COD) poses a significant challenge in computer vision due to the high similarity between objects and their backgrounds. Existing approaches often rely on heavy training and large computational resources. While foundation models such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM) offer strong generalization, they still struggle to handle COD tasks without fine-tuning and require high-quality prompts to yield good performance. However, generating such prompts manually is costly and inefficient. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{First RAG, Second SEG (RAG-SEG)}, a training-free paradigm that decouples COD into two stages: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for generating coarse masks as prompts, followed by SAM-based segmentation (SEG) for refinement. RAG-SEG constructs a compact retrieval database via unsupervised clustering, enabling fast and effective feature retrieval. During inference, the retrieved features produce pseudo-labels that guide precise mask generation using SAM2. Our method eliminates the need for conventional training while maintaining competitive performance. Extensive experiments on benchmark COD datasets demonstrate that RAG-SEG performs on par with or surpasses state-of-the-art methods. Notably, all experiments are conducted on a \textbf{personal laptop}, highlighting the computational efficiency and practicality of our approach. We present further analysis in the Appendix, covering limitations, salient object detection extension, and possible improvements. \textcolor{blue} {Code: https://github.com/Lwt-diamond/RAG-SEG.}</p></details> |  |

Users can also create personalized knowledge bases by uploading their own publication lists, allowing GeoGPT to retrieve and respond using user-provided materials. To further improve retrieval quality and domain alignment, we fine-tuned both the embedding model and a ranking model that scores retrieved passages by relevance to the query. These enhancements optimize RAG for geoscience applications and significantly improve the system's ability to deliver precise and trustworthy outputs. GeoGPT reflects a strong commitment to open science through its emphasis on collaboration, transparency, and community driven development. As part of this commitment, we have open-sourced two core RAG components-GeoEmbedding and GeoReranker-to support geoscientists, researchers, and professionals worldwide with powerful, accessible AI tools.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 10 figures, 10 tables</p></details> |
| **[An Ontology-Driven Graph RAG for Legal Norms: A Structural, Temporal, and Deterministic Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00039v5)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems in the legal domain face a critical challenge: standard, flat-text retrieval is blind to the hierarchical, diachronic, and causal structure of law, leading to anachronistic and unreliable answers. This paper introduces the Structure-Aware Temporal Graph RAG (SAT-Graph RAG), an ontology-driven framework designed to overcome these limitations by explicitly modeling the formal structure and diachronic nature of legal norms. We ground our knowledge graph in a formal, LRMoo-inspired model that distinguishes abstract legal Works from their versioned Expressions. We model temporal states as efficient aggregations that reuse the versioned expressions (CTVs) of unchanged components, and we reify legislative events as first-class Action nodes to make causality explicit and queryable. This structured backbone enables a unified, planner-guided query strategy that applies explicit policies to deterministically resolve complex requests for (i) point-in-time retrieval, (ii) hierarchical impact analysis, and (iii) auditable provenance reconstruction. Through a case study on the Brazilian Constitution, we demonstrate how this approach provides a verifiable, temporally-correct substrate for LLMs, enabling higher-order analytical capabilities while drastically reducing the risk of factual errors. The result is a practical framework for building more trustworthy and explainable legal AI systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Major...</summary><p>Major revision for clarity and academic precision.

| **[MetaRAG: Metamorphic Testing for Hallucination Detection in RAG Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09360v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in enterprise applications, yet their reliability remains limited by hallucinations, i.e., confident but factually incorrect information. Existing detection approaches, such as SelfCheckGPT and MetaQA, primarily target standalone LLMs and do not address the unique challenges of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, where responses must be consistent with retrieved evidence. We therefore present MetaRAG, a metamorphic testing framework for hallucination detection in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. MetaRAG operates in a real-time, unsupervised, black-box setting, requiring neither ground-truth references nor access to model internals, making it suitable for proprietary and high-stakes domains. The framework proceeds in four stages: (1) decompose answers into atomic factoids, (2) generate controlled mutations of each factoid using synonym and antonym substitutions, (3) verify each variant against the retrieved context (synonyms are expected to be entailed and antonyms contradicted), and (4) aggregate penalties for inconsistencies into a response-level hallucination score. Crucially for identity-aware AI, MetaRAG localizes unsupported claims at the factoid span where they occur (e.g., pregnancy-specific precautions, LGBTQ+ refugee rights, or labor eligibility), allowing users to see flagged spans and enabling system designers to configure thresholds and guardrails for identity-sensitive queries. Experiments on a proprietary enterprise dataset illustrate the effectiveness of MetaRAG for detecting hallucinations and enabling trustworthy deployment of RAG-based conversational agents. We also outline a topic-based deployment design that translates MetaRAG's span-level scores into identity-aware safeguards; this design is discussed but not evaluated in our experiments.</p></details> | under review |
| **[Automated Evidence Extraction and Scoring for Corporate Climate Policy Engagement: A Multilingual RAG Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08907v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>InfluenceMap's LobbyMap Platform monitors the climate policy engagement of over 500 companies and 250 industry associations, assessing each entity's support or opposition to science-based policy pathways for achieving the Paris Agreement's goal of limiting global warming to 1.5{\deg}C. Although InfluenceMap has made progress with automating key elements of the analytical workflow, a significant portion of the assessment remains manual, making it time- and labor-intensive and susceptible to human error. We propose an AI-assisted framework to accelerate the monitoring of corporate climate policy engagement by leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation to automate the most time-intensive extraction of relevant evidence from large-scale textual data. Our evaluation shows that a combination of layout-aware parsing, the Nomic embedding model, and few-shot prompting strategies yields the best performance in extracting and classifying evidence from multilingual corporate documents. We conclude that while the automated RAG system effectively accelerates evidence extraction, the nuanced nature of the analysis necessitates a human-in-the-loop approach where the technology augments, rather than replaces, expert judgment to ensure accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM Ensemble for RAG: Role of Context Length in Zero-Shot Question Answering for BioASQ Challenge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08596v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Biomedical question answering (QA) poses significant challenges due to the need for precise interpretation of specialized knowledge drawn from a vast, complex, and rapidly evolving corpus. In this work, we explore how large language models (LLMs) can be used for information retrieval (IR), and an ensemble of zero-shot models can accomplish state-of-the-art performance on a domain-specific Yes/No QA task. Evaluating our approach on the BioASQ challenge tasks, we show that ensembles can outperform individual LLMs and in some cases rival or surpass domain-tuned systems - all while preserving generalizability and avoiding the need for costly fine-tuning or labeled data. Our method aggregates outputs from multiple LLM variants, including models from Anthropic and Google, to synthesize more accurate and robust answers. Moreover, our investigation highlights a relationship between context length and performance: while expanded contexts are meant to provide valuable evidence, they simultaneously risk information dilution and model disorientation. These findings emphasize IR as a critical foundation in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approaches for biomedical QA systems. Precise, focused retrieval remains essential for ensuring LLMs operate within relevant information boundaries when generating answers from retrieved documents. Our results establish that ensemble-based zero-shot approaches, when paired with effective RAG pipelines, constitute a practical and scalable alternative to domain-tuned systems for biomedical question answering.</p></details> | CEUR-WS, CLEF2025 |

This capability is especially critical in the legal domain. In this work, we introduce a novel end-to-end RAG pipeline that improves upon previous baselines using three targeted enhancements: (i) a context-aware query translator that disentangles document references from natural-language questions and adapts retrieval depth and response style based on expertise and specificity, (ii) open-source retrieval strategies using SBERT and GTE embeddings that achieve substantial performance gains while remaining cost-efficient, and (iii) a comprehensive evaluation and generation framework that combines RAGAS, BERTScore-F1, and ROUGE-Recall to assess semantic alignment and faithfulness across models and prompt designs. Our results show that carefully designed open-source pipelines can rival proprietary approaches in retrieval quality, while a custom legal-grounded prompt consistently produces more faithful and contextually relevant answers than baseline prompting. Taken together, these contributions demonstrate the potential of task-aware, component-level tuning to deliver legally grounded, reproducible, and cost-effective RAG systems for legal research assistance.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to NLLP 2025 Workshop</p></details> |
| **[TextlessRAG: End-to-End Visual Document RAG by Speech Without Text](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07538v2)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Document images encapsulate a wealth of knowledge, while the portability of spoken queries enables broader and flexible application scenarios. Yet, no prior work has explored knowledge base question answering over visual document images with queries provided directly in speech. We propose TextlessRAG, the first end-to-end framework for speech-based question answering over large-scale document images. Unlike prior methods, TextlessRAG eliminates ASR, TTS and OCR, directly interpreting speech, retrieving relevant visual knowledge, and generating answers in a fully textless pipeline. To further boost performance, we integrate a layout-aware reranking mechanism to refine retrieval. Experiments demonstrate substantial improvements in both efficiency and accuracy. To advance research in this direction, we also release the first bilingual speech--document RAG dataset, featuring Chinese and English voice queries paired with multimodal document content. Both the dataset and our pipeline will be made available at repository:https://github.com/xiepeijinhit-hue/textlessrag</p></details> | 5 pages, 4 figures, |
| **[CyberRAG: An Agentic RAG cyber attack classification and reporting tool](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02424v2)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS) in large enterprises can generate hundreds of thousands of alerts per hour, overwhelming analysts with logs requiring rapidly evolving expertise. Conventional machine-learning detectors reduce alert volume but still yield many false positives, while standard Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines often retrieve irrelevant context and fail to justify predictions. We present CyberRAG, a modular agent-based RAG framework that delivers real-time classification, explanation, and structured reporting for cyber-attacks. A central LLM agent orchestrates: (i) fine-tuned classifiers specialized by attack family; (ii) tool adapters for enrichment and alerting; and (iii) an iterative retrieval-and-reason loop that queries a domain-specific knowledge base until evidence is relevant and self-consistent. Unlike traditional RAG, CyberRAG adopts an agentic design that enables dynamic control flow and adaptive reasoning. This architecture autonomously refines threat labels and natural-language justifications, reducing false positives and enhancing interpretability. It is also extensible: new attack types can be supported by adding classifiers without retraining the core agent. CyberRAG was evaluated on SQL Injection, XSS, and SSTI, achieving over 94\% accuracy per class and a final classification accuracy of 94.92\% through semantic orchestration. Generated explanations reached 0.94 in BERTScore and 4.9/5 in GPT-4-based expert evaluation, with robustness preserved against adversarial and unseen payloads. These results show that agentic, specialist-oriented RAG can combine high detection accuracy with trustworthy, SOC-ready prose, offering a flexible path toward partially automated cyber-defense workflows.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Iterative LLM Framework for SIBT utilizing RAG-based Adaptive Weight Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08407v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Seed implant brachytherapy (SIBT) is an effective cancer treatment modality; however, clinical planning often relies on manual adjustment of objective function weights, leading to inefficiencies and suboptimal results. This study proposes an adaptive weight optimization framework for SIBT planning, driven by large language models (LLMs). A locally deployed DeepSeek-R1 LLM is integrated with an automatic planning algorithm in an iterative loop. Starting with fixed weights, the LLM evaluates plan quality and recommends new weights in the next iteration. This process continues until convergence criteria are met, after which the LLM conducts a comprehensive evaluation to identify the optimal plan. A clinical knowledge base, constructed and queried via retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), enhances the model's domain-specific reasoning. The proposed method was validated on 23 patient cases, showing that the LLM-assisted approach produces plans that are comparable to or exceeding clinically approved and fixed-weight plans, in terms of dose homogeneity for the clinical target volume (CTV) and sparing of organs at risk (OARs). The study demonstrates the potential use of LLMs in SIBT planning automation.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Multimodal RAG Framework for Housing Damage Assessment: Collaborative Optimization of Image Encoding and Policy Vector Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09721v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>After natural disasters, accurate evaluations of damage to housing are important for insurance claims response and planning of resources. In this work, we introduce a novel multimodal retrieval-augmented generation (MM-RAG) framework. On top of classical RAG architecture, we further the framework to devise a two-branch multimodal encoder structure that the image branch employs a visual encoder composed of ResNet and Transformer to extract the characteristic of building damage after disaster, and the text branch harnesses a BERT retriever for the text vectorization of posts as well as insurance policies and for the construction of a retrievable restoration index. To impose cross-modal semantic alignment, the model integrates a cross-modal interaction module to bridge the semantic representation between image and text via multi-head attention. Meanwhile, in the generation module, the introduced modal attention gating mechanism dynamically controls the role of visual evidence and text prior information during generation. The entire framework takes end-to-end training, and combines the comparison loss, the retrieval loss and the generation loss to form multi-task optimization objectives, and achieves image understanding and policy matching in collaborative learning. The results demonstrate superior performance in retrieval accuracy and classification index on damage severity, where the Top-1 retrieval accuracy has been improved by 9.6%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Aligning LLMs for the Classroom with Knowledge-Based Retrieval -- A Comparative RAG Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07846v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models like ChatGPT are increasingly used in classrooms, but they often provide outdated or fabricated information that can mislead students. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) improves reliability of LLMs by grounding responses in external resources. We investigate two accessible RAG paradigms, vector-based retrieval and graph-based retrieval to identify best practices for classroom question answering (QA). Existing comparative studies fail to account for pedagogical factors such as educational disciplines, question types, and practical deployment costs. Using a novel dataset, EduScopeQA, of 3,176 questions across academic subjects, we measure performance on various educational query types, from specific facts to broad thematic discussions. We also evaluate system alignment with a dataset of systematically altered textbooks that contradict the LLM's latent knowledge. We find that OpenAI Vector Search RAG (representing vector-based RAG) performs well as a low-cost generalist, especially for quick fact retrieval. On the other hand, GraphRAG Global excels at providing pedagogically rich answers to thematic queries, and GraphRAG Local achieves the highest accuracy with the dense, altered textbooks when corpus integrity is critical. Accounting for the 10-20x higher resource usage of GraphRAG (representing graph-based RAG), we show that a dynamic branching framework that routes queries to the optimal retrieval method boosts fidelity and efficiency. These insights provide actionable guidelines for educators and system designers to integrate RAG-augmented LLMs into learning environments effectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

However, most existing RAG research in finance focuses predominantly on textual data, overlooking the rich visual content in financial documents, resulting in the loss of key analytical insights. To bridge this gap, we present FinRAGBench-V, a comprehensive visual RAG benchmark tailored for finance which effectively integrates multimodal data and provides visual citation to ensure traceability. It includes a bilingual retrieval corpus with 60,780 Chinese and 51,219 English pages, along with a high-quality, human-annotated question-answering (QA) dataset spanning heterogeneous data types and seven question categories. Moreover, we introduce RGenCite, an RAG baseline that seamlessly integrates visual citation with generation. Furthermore, we propose an automatic citation evaluation method to systematically assess the visual citation capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Extensive experiments on RGenCite underscore the challenging nature of FinRAGBench-V, providing valuable insights for the development of multimodal RAG systems in finance.</p></details> |  |

Existing coarse-ranking optimization approaches often struggle to balance domain-specific knowledge learning with query enhencement, resulting in suboptimal retrieval performance. To address this challenge, we propose MoLER, a domain-aware RAG method that uses MoL-Enhanced Reinforcement Learning to optimize retrieval. MoLER has a two-stage pipeline: a continual pre-training (CPT) phase using a Mixture of Losses (MoL) to balance domain-specific knowledge with general language capabilities, and a reinforcement learning (RL) phase leveraging Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to optimize query and passage generation for maximizing document recall. A key innovation is our Multi-query Single-passage Late Fusion (MSLF) strategy, which reduces computational overhead during RL training while maintaining scalable inference via Multi-query Multi-passage Late Fusion (MMLF). Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that MoLER achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming baseline methods. MoLER bridges the knowledge gap in RAG systems, enabling robust and scalable retrieval in specialized domains.</p></details> |  |

However, LLMs often fail to faithfully integrate retrieved evidence into their generated responses, leading to factual inconsistencies. To quantify this gap, we introduce Entity-Context Divergence (ECD), a metric that measures the extent to which retrieved information is accurately reflected in model outputs. We systematically evaluate contemporary LLMs on their ability to preserve factual consistency in retrieval-augmented settings, a capability we define as RAG-ability. Our empirical analysis reveals that RAG-ability remains low across most LLMs, highlighting significant challenges in entity retention and context fidelity. This paper introduces Radiant (Retrieval AugmenteD entIty-context AligNmenT), a novel framework that merges RAG with alignment designed to optimize the interplay between retrieved evidence and generated content. Radiant extends Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to teach LLMs how to integrate provided additional information into subsequent generations. As a behavior correction mechanism, Radiant boosts RAG performance across varied retrieval scenarios, such as noisy web contexts, knowledge conflicts, and hallucination reduction. This enables more reliable, contextually grounded, and factually coherent content generation.</p></details> |  |

Addressing the shortcomings of conventional health search engines and the lag in public access to biomedical research, the system integrates diverse sources, including PubMed articles, curated Q&A datasets, and medical encyclopedias ,to retrieve relevant information and generate concise, context-aware responses.

| **[Graph RAG as Human Choice Model: Building a Data-Driven Mobility Agent with Preference Chain](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16172v2)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding human behavior in urban environments is a crucial field within city sciences. However, collecting accurate behavioral data, particularly in newly developed areas, poses significant challenges. Recent advances in generative agents, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), have shown promise in simulating human behaviors without relying on extensive datasets. Nevertheless, these methods often struggle with generating consistent, context-sensitive, and realistic behavioral outputs. To address these limitations, this paper introduces the Preference Chain, a novel method that integrates Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with LLMs to enhance context-aware simulation of human behavior in transportation systems. Experiments conducted on the Replica dataset demonstrate that the Preference Chain outperforms standard LLM in aligning with real-world transportation mode choices. The development of the Mobility Agent highlights potential applications of proposed method in urban mobility modeling for emerging cities, personalized travel behavior analysis, and dynamic traffic forecasting. Despite limitations such as slow inference and the risk of hallucination, the method offers a promising framework for simulating complex human behavior in data-scarce environments, where traditional data-driven models struggle due to limited data availability.</p></details> |  |

Distillation-Guided Policy Optimization for Preserving Agentic RAG Capabilities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20324v2)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning has emerged as a post-training approach to elicit agentic RAG behaviors such as search and planning from language models. However, compact language models (e.g., 0.5B parameters) struggle due to poor reasoning ability, resulting in sparse rewards and unstable training. To overcome these difficulties, we propose Distillation-Guided Policy Optimization (DGPO), which addresses the challenges through cold-start initialization from teacher demonstrations and continuous teacher guidance during policy optimization. To systematically evaluate our approach, we introduce Agentic RAG Capabilities (ARC), a fine-grained metric analyzing reasoning, search coordination, and response synthesis. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that DGPO enables compact models to achieve sophisticated agentic search behaviors, even outperforming the larger teacher model in some cases. DGPO makes agentic RAG feasible in computing resource-constrained environments.</p></details> |  |

Our approach addresses the challenges of understanding and retrieving complex technical content by leveraging the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). First, we enhance user queries by generating expanded representations that better capture user intent and improve dataset diversity, thereby enriching the fine-tuning process for embedding models. Second, we apply summary extraction techniques to encode essential contextual information, refining the representation of technical documents. To further enhance retrieval performance, we fine-tune a bi-encoder BERT model using soft prompting, incorporating separate learning parameters for queries and document context to capture fine-grained semantic nuances. We evaluate our approach on two public datasets, RAG-EDA and Rust-Docs-QA, demonstrating that Technical-Embeddings significantly outperforms baseline models in both precision and recall. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of integrating query expansion and contextual summarization to enhance information access and comprehension in technical domains. This work advances the state of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, offering new avenues for efficient and accurate technical document retrieval in engineering and product development workflows.</p></details> |  |

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) improves accuracy by grounding outputs in external knowledge, especially in domains like healthcare, where precision is vital. However, RAG remains opaque and essentially a black box, heavily dependent on data quality. We developed a method-agnostic, perturbation-based framework that provides token and component-level interoperability for Graph RAG using SMILE and named it as Knowledge-Graph (KG)-SMILE. By applying controlled perturbations, computing similarities, and training weighted linear surrogates, KG-SMILE identifies the graph entities and relations most influential to generated outputs, thereby making RAG more transparent. We evaluate KG-SMILE using comprehensive attribution metrics, including fidelity, faithfulness, consistency, stability, and accuracy. Our findings show that KG-SMILE produces stable, human-aligned explanations, demonstrating its capacity to balance model effectiveness with interpretability and thereby fostering greater transparency and trust in machine learning technologies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal Iterative RAG for Knowledge Visual Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00798v2)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly advanced multimodal understanding, their performance remains limited on knowledge-intensive visual questions that require external knowledge beyond the image. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a promising solution for providing models with external knowledge, its conventional single-pass framework often fails to gather sufficient knowledge. To overcome this limitation, we propose MI-RAG, a Multimodal Iterative RAG framework that leverages reasoning to enhance retrieval and update reasoning over newly retrieved knowledge across modalities. At each iteration, MI-RAG leverages an accumulated reasoning record to dynamically formulate a multi-query. These queries then drive a joint search across heterogeneous knowledge bases containing both visually-grounded and textual knowledge. The newly acquired knowledge is synthesized into the reasoning record, progressively refining understanding across iterations. Experiments on challenging benchmarks, including Encyclopedic VQA, InfoSeek, and OK-VQA, show that MI-RAG significantly improves both retrieval recall and answer accuracy, establishing a scalable approach for compositional reasoning in knowledge-intensive VQA.</p></details> |  |

However, effectively combining evidence from these heterogeneous sources is challenging as the respective similarity scores are not inter-comparable. Additionally, aggregating beliefs from the outputs of multiple rankers can improve the effectiveness of RAG. Our proposed method first aggregates the top-documents from a number of IR models using a standard rank fusion technique for each source (labeled and unlabeled). Next, we standardize the retrieval score distributions within each source by applying z-score transformation before merging the top-retrieved documents from the two sources. We evaluate our approach on the fact verification task, demonstrating that it consistently improves over the best-performing individual ranker or source and also shows better out-of-domain generalization.</p></details> |  |
| **[VaccineRAG: Boosting Multimodal Large Language Models' Immunity to Harmful RAG Samples](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04502v1)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval Augmented Generation enhances the response accuracy of Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating retrieval and generation modules with external knowledge, demonstrating particular strength in real-time queries and Visual Question Answering tasks. However, the effectiveness of RAG is frequently hindered by the precision of the retriever: many retrieved samples fed into the generation phase are irrelevant or misleading, posing a critical bottleneck to LLMs' performance. To address this challenge, we introduce VaccineRAG, a novel Chain-of-Thought-based retrieval-augmented generation dataset. On one hand, VaccineRAG employs a benchmark to evaluate models using data with varying positive/negative sample ratios, systematically exposing inherent weaknesses in current LLMs. On the other hand, it enhances models' sample-discrimination capabilities by prompting LLMs to generate explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) analysis for each sample before producing final answers. Furthermore, to enhance the model's ability to learn long-sequence complex CoT content, we propose Partial-GRPO. By modeling the outputs of LLMs as multiple components rather than a single whole, our model can make more informed preference selections for complex sequences, thereby enhancing its capacity to learn complex CoT. Comprehensive evaluations and ablation studies on VaccineRAG validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. The code and dataset will be publicly released soon.</p></details> |  |

In the financial field, the stringent demands for professional accuracy and real-time data processing often necessitate the use of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques. However, the development of financial RAG benchmarks has been constrained by data confidentiality issues and the lack of dynamic data integration. To address this issue, we introduce FinS-Pilot, a novel benchmark for evaluating RAG systems in online financial applications. Constructed from real-world financial assistant interactions, our benchmark incorporates both real-time API data and text data, organized through an intent classification framework covering critical financial domains. The benchmark enables comprehensive evaluation of financial assistants' capabilities in handling both static knowledge and time-sensitive market information.Through systematic experiments with multiple Chinese leading LLMs, we demonstrate FinS-Pilot's effectiveness in identifying models suitable for financial applications while addressing the current gap in specialized evaluation tools for the financial domain. Our work contributes both a practical evaluation framework and a curated dataset to advance research in financial NLP systems. The code and dataset are accessible on GitHub.</p></details> |  |
| **[REFRAG: Rethinking RAG based Decoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01092v1)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in leveraging extensive external knowledge to enhance responses in multi-turn and agentic applications, such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). However, processing long-context inputs introduces significant system latency and demands substantial memory for the key-value cache, resulting in reduced throughput and a fundamental trade-off between knowledge enrichment and system efficiency. While minimizing latency for long-context inputs is a primary objective for LLMs, we contend that RAG require specialized consideration. In RAG, much of the LLM context consists of concatenated passages from retrieval, with only a small subset directly relevant to the query. These passages often exhibit low semantic similarity due to diversity or deduplication during re-ranking, leading to block-diagonal attention patterns that differ from those in standard LLM generation tasks. Based on this observation, we argue that most computations over the RAG context during decoding are unnecessary and can be eliminated with minimal impact on performance. To this end, we propose REFRAG, an efficient decoding framework that compresses, senses, and expands to improve latency in RAG applications. By exploiting the sparsity structure, we demonstrate a 30.85 the time-to-first-token acceleration (3.75 improvement to previous work) without loss in perplexity. In addition, our optimization framework for large context enables REFRAG to extend the context size of LLMs by 16. We provide rigorous validation of REFRAG across diverse long-context tasks, including RAG, multi-turn conversations, and long document summarization, spanning a wide range of datasets. Experimental results confirm that REFRAG delivers substantial speedup with no loss in accuracy compared to LLaMA models and other state-of-the-art baselines across various context sizes.</p></details> |  |
| **[OCR Hinders RAG: Evaluating the Cascading Impact of OCR on Retrieval-Augmented Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02592v4)** | 2025-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating external knowledge to reduce hallucinations and incorporate up-to-date information without retraining. As an essential part of RAG, external knowledge bases are commonly built by extracting structured data from unstructured PDF documents using Optical Character Recognition (OCR). However, given the imperfect prediction of OCR and the inherent non-uniform representation of structured data, knowledge bases inevitably contain various OCR noises. In this paper, we introduce OHRBench, the first benchmark for understanding the cascading impact of OCR on RAG systems. OHRBench includes 8,561 carefully selected unstructured document images from seven real-world RAG application domains, along with 8,498 Q&A pairs derived from multimodal elements in documents, challenging existing OCR solutions used for RAG. To better understand OCR's impact on RAG systems, we identify two primary types of OCR noise: Semantic Noise and Formatting Noise and apply perturbation to generate a set of structured data with varying degrees of each OCR noise. Using OHRBench, we first conduct a comprehensive evaluation of current OCR solutions and reveal that none is competent for constructing high-quality knowledge bases for RAG systems. We then systematically evaluate the impact of these two noise types and demonstrate the trend relationship between the degree of OCR noise and RAG performance. Our OHRBench, including PDF documents, Q&As, and the ground truth structured data are released at: https://github.com/opendatalab/OHR-Bench</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |

Empirical Insights into Reasoning under Incomplete Knowledge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08344v2)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (KG-RAG) is an increasingly explored approach for combining the reasoning capabilities of large language models with the structured evidence of knowledge graphs. However, current evaluation practices fall short: existing benchmarks often include questions that can be directly answered using existing triples in KG, making it unclear whether models perform reasoning or simply retrieve answers directly. Moreover, inconsistent evaluation metrics and lenient answer matching criteria further obscure meaningful comparisons. In this work, we introduce a general method for constructing benchmarks, together with an evaluation protocol, to systematically assess KG-RAG methods under knowledge incompleteness. Our empirical results show that current KG-RAG methods have limited reasoning ability under missing knowledge, often rely on internal memorization, and exhibit varying degrees of generalization depending on their design.</p></details> |  |

We present MODE (Mixture of Document Experts), a lightweight alternative that replaces fine-grained nearest-neighbor search with cluster-and-route retrieval. Documents are embedded, grouped into semantically coherent clusters, and represented by cached centroids. At query time, we route to the top centroid(s) and retrieve context only within those clusters, eliminating external vector-database infrastructure and reranking while keeping latency low. On HotpotQA and SQuAD corpora with 100-500 chunks, MODE matches or exceeds a dense-retrieval baseline in answer quality while reducing end-to-end retrieval time. Ablations show that cluster granularity and multi-cluster routing control the recall/precision trade-off, and that tighter clusters improve downstream accuracy. MODE offers a practical recipe for small and medium corpora where simplicity, speed, and topical focus matter.</p></details> |  |

In response, we developed a mental health support chatbot designed to augment professional healthcare, with a strong emphasis on safe and meaningful application. Our approach involved rigorous evaluation, covering accuracy, empathy, trustworthiness, privacy, and bias. We employed a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework, integrated prompt engineering, and fine-tuned a pre-trained model on novel datasets. The resulting system, Mentalic Net Conversational AI, achieved a BERT Score of 0.898, with other evaluation metrics falling within satisfactory ranges.

However, the effectiveness and trustworthiness of these systems critically depends on how they are evaluated, particularly on whether the evaluation process captures real-world constraints like protecting sensitive information. While current evaluation efforts for RAG systems have primarily focused on the development of performance metrics, far less attention has been given to the design and quality of the underlying evaluation datasets, despite their pivotal role in enabling meaningful, reliable assessments. In this work, we introduce a novel multi-agent framework for generating synthetic QA datasets for RAG evaluation that prioritize semantic diversity and privacy preservation. Our approach involves: (1) a Diversity agent leveraging clustering techniques to maximize topical coverage and semantic variability, (2) a Privacy Agent that detects and mask sensitive information across multiple domains and (3) a QA curation agent that synthesizes private and diverse QA pairs suitable as ground truth for RAG evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our evaluation sets outperform baseline methods in diversity and achieve robust privacy masking on domain-specific datasets. This work offers a practical and ethically aligned pathway toward safer, more comprehensive RAG system evaluation, laying the foundation for future enhancements aligned with evolving AI regulations and compliance standards.</p></details> | <details><summary>ECAI ...</summary><p>ECAI 2025 TRUST AI workshop</p></details> |

Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) indexing methods aim to address this challenge by selectively retrieving only necessary document segments. However, narrative texts possess unique characteristics that limit the effectiveness of these existing approaches. Specifically, understanding narrative texts requires more than isolated segments, as the broader context and sequential relationships between segments are crucial for comprehension. To address these limitations, we propose ChronoRAG, a novel RAG framework specialized for narrative texts. This approach focuses on two essential aspects: refining dispersed document information into coherent and structured passages, and preserving narrative flow by explicitly capturing and maintaining the temporal order among retrieved passages. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of ChronoRAG through experiments on the NarrativeQA dataset, showing substantial improvements in tasks requiring both factual identification and comprehension of complex sequential relationships, underscoring that reasoning over temporal order is crucial in resolving narrative QA.</p></details> | 7 pages, 3 figures |

However, co-locating the vector retriever and the LLM on shared GPU infrastructure introduces significant challenges: vector search is memory and I/O intensive, while LLM inference demands high throughput and low latency. Naive resource sharing often leads to severe performance degradation, particularly under high request load or large index sizes. We present VectorLiteRAG, a deployment-friendly RAG system that achieves latency-compliant inference without requiring additional hardware resources. VectorLiteRAG introduces a fine-grained GPU resource allocation mechanism based on detailed performance modeling and access pattern analysis. By estimating search latency and query hit rate distributions, it identifies an optimal index partitioning point across CPU and GPU tiers to minimize contention and maximize throughput. Our evaluations show that VectorLiteRAG consistently expands the SLO compliant request rate range across all tested configurations, including both small and large LLMs, and small and large vector databases compared to naive baselines and state of the art alternatives. In the best case, VectorLiteRAG improves the attainable SLO throughput by up to 1.5 times without compromising generation quality or requiring additional compute resources.</p></details> |  |

Our benchmark is built on a user manual for an agricultural machine, available in English, French, and German. It simulates a cross-lingual information retrieval scenario where questions are posed in English against all three language versions of the manual. The evaluation focuses on realistic "needle-in-a-haystack" challenges and includes unanswerable questions to test for hallucinations. We compare nine long-context LLMs using direct prompting against three Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) strategies (keyword, semantic, hybrid), with an LLM-as-a-judge for evaluation. Our findings for this specific manual show that Hybrid RAG consistently outperforms direct long-context prompting. Models like Gemini 2.5 Flash and the smaller Qwen 2.5 7B achieve high accuracy (over 85%) across all languages with RAG. This paper contributes a detailed analysis of LLM performance in a specialized industrial domain and an open framework for similar evaluations, highlighting practical trade-offs and challenges.</p></details> |  |

On the first level of analytics, the fine-tuned model generates graph and text summaries with sentiment scores as well as JSON representations of summaries. Higher levels perform hierarchical stacking that consolidates sets of graph-based and text-based summaries as well as summaries of summaries into comprehensive reports. The combination of graph and text summaries provides complementary views of cryptocurrency news. The model is fine-tuned with 4-bit quantization using the PEFT/LoRA approach. The representation of cryptocurrency news as knowledge graph can essentially eliminate problems with large language model hallucinations. The obtained results demonstrate that the use of fine-tuned Mistral 7B LLM models for multilevel cryptocurrency news analysis can conduct informative qualitative and quantitative analytics, providing important insights.</p></details> |  |

Learned query optimizers (LQOs) can improve performance over time by incorporating feedback; however, they suffer from cold-start issues and often require retraining when workloads shift or schemas change. Recent LLM-based query optimizers leverage pre-trained and fine-tuned LLMs to mitigate these challenges. Nevertheless, they neglect LLMs' in-context learning and execution records as feedback for continuous evolution. In this paper, we present SEFRQO, a Self-Evolving Fine-tuned RAG-based Query Optimizer. SEFRQO mitigates the cold-start problem of LQOs by continuously learning from execution feedback via a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework. We employ both supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement fine-tuning to prepare the LLM to produce syntactically correct and performance-efficient query hints. Moreover, SEFRQO leverages the LLM's in-context learning capabilities by dynamically constructing prompts with references to similar queries and the historical execution record of the same query. This self-evolving paradigm iteratively optimizes the prompt to minimize query execution latency. Evaluations show that SEFRQO outperforms state-of-the-art LQOs, achieving up to 65.05% and 93.57% reductions in query latency on the CEB and Stack workloads, respectively, compared to PostgreSQL.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at SIGMOD 2026 (https://2026.sigmod.org/)</p></details> |

Despite its widespread use, most RAG pipelines continue to treat retrieval and reasoning as isolated components, retrieving documents once and then generating answers without further interaction. This static design often limits performance on complex tasks that require iterative evidence gathering or high-precision retrieval. Recent work in both the information retrieval (IR) and NLP communities has begun to close this gap by introducing adaptive retrieval and ranking methods that incorporate feedback. In this survey, we present a structured overview of advanced retrieval and ranking mechanisms that integrate such feedback. We categorize feedback signals based on their source and role in improving the query, retrieved context, or document pool. By consolidating these developments, we aim to bridge IR and NLP perspectives and highlight retrieval as a dynamic, learnable component of end-to-end RAG systems.</p></details> | 18 pages, 1 figure |

Simulating Vulnerabilities, and Threats in Multimodal Medical RAG System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17215v1)** | 2025-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) augmented with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) are increasingly employed in medical AI to enhance factual grounding through external clinical image-text retrieval. However, this reliance creates a significant attack surface. We propose MedThreatRAG, a novel multimodal poisoning framework that systematically probes vulnerabilities in medical RAG systems by injecting adversarial image-text pairs. A key innovation of our approach is the construction of a simulated semi-open attack environment, mimicking real-world medical systems that permit periodic knowledge base updates via user or pipeline contributions. Within this setting, we introduce and emphasize Cross-Modal Conflict Injection (CMCI), which embeds subtle semantic contradictions between medical images and their paired reports. These mismatches degrade retrieval and generation by disrupting cross-modal alignment while remaining sufficiently plausible to evade conventional filters. While basic textual and visual attacks are included for completeness, CMCI demonstrates the most severe degradation. Evaluations on IU-Xray and MIMIC-CXR QA tasks show that MedThreatRAG reduces answer F1 scores by up to 27.66% and lowers LLaVA-Med-1.5 F1 rates to as low as 51.36%. Our findings expose fundamental security gaps in clinical RAG systems and highlight the urgent need for threat-aware design and robust multimodal consistency checks. Finally, we conclude with a concise set of guidelines to inform the safe development of future multimodal medical RAG systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Sumbi...</summary><p>Sumbitted to 2025 AAAI main track</p></details> |

Large Language Models (LLMs) offer unprecedented analytical opportunities however, their knowledge base is constrained to the models' last training date, rendering these capabilities unusable for organizations whose mission impacts rely on emerging and timely information. This research proposes an innovative approach to supply chain analysis by integrating emerging Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) preprocessing and retrieval techniques with advanced web-scraping technologies. Our method aims to reduce latency in incorporating new information into an augmented-LLM, enabling timely analysis of supply chain disruptors. Through experimentation, this study evaluates the combinatorial effects of these techniques towards timeliness and quality trade-offs. Our results suggest that in applying RAG systems to supply chain analysis, fine-tuning the embedding retrieval model consistently provides the most significant performance gains, underscoring the critical importance of retrieval quality. Adaptive iterative retrieval, which dynamically adjusts retrieval depth based on context, further enhances performance, especially on complex supply chain queries. Conversely, fine-tuning the LLM yields limited improvements and higher resource costs, while techniques such as downward query abstraction significantly outperforms upward abstraction in practice.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 5 figures, 1 table.

While RDF/OWL reasoners enable graph-based reasoning, they are limited to fragments of first-order logic, preventing deeper temporal and semantic analysis. This paper addresses both challenges by developing automatic historical event extraction models using multiple LLMs (GPT-4, Claude, Llama 3.2) with three enhancement strategies: pure base generation, knowledge graph enhancement, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). We conducted comprehensive evaluations using historical texts from Thucydides. Our findings reveal that enhancement strategies optimize different performance dimensions rather than providing universal improvements. For coverage and historical breadth, base generation achieves optimal performance with Claude and GPT-4 extracting comprehensive events. However, for precision, RAG enhancement improves coordinate accuracy and metadata completeness. Model architecture fundamentally determines enhancement sensitivity: larger models demonstrate robust baseline performance with incremental RAG improvements, while Llama 3.2 shows extreme variance from competitive performance to complete failure. We then developed an automated translation pipeline converting extracted RDF representations into Coq proof assistant specifications, enabling higher-order reasoning beyond RDF capabilities including multi-step causal verification, temporal arithmetic with BC dates, and formal proofs about historical causation. The Coq formalization validates that RAG-discovered event types represent legitimate domain-specific semantic structures rather than ontological violations.</p></details> |  |

These benchmarks overlook key factors such as the interaction between retrieval difficulty and reasoning depth. To address this gap, we propose \textsc{GRADE}, a novel evaluation framework that models task difficulty along two orthogonal dimensions: (1) reasoning depth, defined by the number of inference steps (hops), and (2) semantic distance between the query and its supporting evidence. We construct a synthetic multi-hop QA dataset from factual news articles by extracting knowledge graphs and augmenting them through semantic clustering to recover missing links, allowing us to generate diverse and difficulty-controlled queries. Central to our framework is a 2D difficulty matrix that combines generator-side and retriever-side difficulty. Experiments across multiple domains and models show that error rates strongly correlate with our difficulty measures, validating their diagnostic utility. \textsc{GRADE} enables fine-grained analysis of RAG performance and provides a scalable foundation for evaluating and improving multi-hop reasoning in real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP 2025 findings</p></details> |

Retrieval and tool-augmented methods help, but their impact is limited by weak use of external knowledge and poor feedback-reasoning traceability. To address these challenges, We introduce Deep-DxSearch, an agentic RAG system trained end-to-end with reinforcement learning (RL) that enables steer tracebale retrieval-augmented reasoning for medical diagnosis. In Deep-DxSearch, we first construct a large-scale medical retrieval corpus comprising patient records and reliable medical knowledge sources to support retrieval-aware reasoning across diagnostic scenarios. More crutially, we frame the LLM as the core agent and the retrieval corpus as its environment, using tailored rewards on format, retrieval, reasoning structure, and diagnostic accuracy, thereby evolving the agentic RAG policy from large-scale data through RL. Experiments demonstrate that our end-to-end agentic RL training framework consistently outperforms prompt-engineering and training-free RAG approaches across multiple data centers. After training, Deep-DxSearch achieves substantial gains in diagnostic accuracy, surpassing strong diagnostic baselines such as GPT-4o, DeepSeek-R1, and other medical-specific frameworks for both common and rare disease diagnosis under in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings. Moreover, ablation studies on reward design and retrieval corpus components confirm their critical roles, underscoring the uniqueness and effectiveness of our approach compared with traditional implementations. Finally, case studies and interpretability analyses highlight improvements in Deep-DxSearch's diagnostic policy, providing deeper insight into its performance gains and supporting clinicians in delivering more reliable and precise preliminary diagnoses.

Within the ORAN architecture, Large Language Models (LLMs) can be specialized to generate xApps and rApps by leveraging specifications and API definitions from the RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC) platform. However, fine-tuning base LLMs for telecom-specific tasks remains expensive and resource-intensive. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers a practical alternative through in-context learning, enabling domain adaptation without full retraining. While traditional RAG systems rely on vector-based retrieval, emerging variants such as GraphRAG and Hybrid GraphRAG incorporate knowledge graphs or dual retrieval strategies to support multi-hop reasoning and improve factual grounding. Despite their promise, these methods lack systematic, metric-driven evaluations, particularly in high-stakes domains such as ORAN. In this study, we conduct a comparative evaluation of Vector RAG, GraphRAG, and Hybrid GraphRAG using ORAN specifications. We assess performance across varying question complexities using established generation metrics: faithfulness, answer relevance, context relevance, and factual correctness. Results show that both GraphRAG and Hybrid GraphRAG outperform traditional RAG. Hybrid GraphRAG improves factual correctness by 8%, while GraphRAG improves context relevance by 11%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Each to Their Own: Exploring the Optimal Embedding in RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17442v2)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, as Large Language Models (LLMs) have fundamentally impacted various fields, the methods for incorporating up-to-date information into LLMs or adding external knowledge to construct domain-specific models have garnered wide attention. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), serving as an inference-time scaling method, is notable for its low cost and minimal effort for parameter tuning. However, due to heterogeneous training data and model architecture, the variant embedding models used in RAG exhibit different benefits across various areas, often leading to different similarity calculation results and, consequently, varying response quality from LLMs. To address this problem, we propose and examine two approaches to enhance RAG by combining the benefits of multiple embedding models, named Mixture-Embedding RAG and Confident RAG. Mixture-Embedding RAG simply sorts and selects retrievals from multiple embedding models based on standardized similarity; however, it does not outperform vanilla RAG. In contrast, Confident RAG generates responses multiple times using different embedding models and then selects the responses with the highest confidence level, demonstrating average improvements of approximately 10% and 5% over vanilla LLMs and RAG, respectively. The consistent results across different LLMs and embedding models indicate that Confident RAG is an efficient plug-and-play approach for various domains. We will release our code upon publication.</p></details> |  |

Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) offers a practical and privacy-preserving way to enhance LLMs with external medical knowledge. However, most existing approaches rely on surface-level semantic retrieval and lack the structured reasoning needed for clinical decision support. We introduce MedCoT-RAG, a domain-specific framework that combines causal-aware document retrieval with structured chain-of-thought prompting tailored to medical workflows. This design enables models to retrieve evidence aligned with diagnostic logic and generate step-by-step causal reasoning reflective of real-world clinical practice. Experiments on three diverse medical QA benchmarks show that MedCoT-RAG outperforms strong baselines by up to 10.3% over vanilla RAG and 6.4% over advanced domain-adapted methods, improving accuracy, interpretability, and consistency in complex medical tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, despite the emergence of various RAG frameworks, a single RAG framework still cannot adapt well to a broad range of downstream tasks. Therefore, how to leverage the advantages of multiple RAG systems has become an area worth exploring. To address this issue, we have conducted a comprehensive and systematic investigation into ensemble methods based on RAG systems. Specifically, we have analyzed the RAG ensemble framework from both theoretical and mechanistic analysis perspectives. From the theoretical analysis, we provide the first explanation of the RAG ensemble framework from the perspective of information entropy. In terms of mechanism analysis, we have explored the RAG ensemble framework from both the pipeline and module levels. We carefully select four different pipelines (Branching, Iterative, Loop, and Agentic) and three different modules (Generator, Retriever, and Reranker) to solve seven different research questions. The experiments show that aggregating multiple RAG systems is both generalizable and robust, whether at the pipeline level or the module level. Our work lays the foundation for similar research on the multi-RAG system ensemble.</p></details> |  |

Grid codes, the regulations governing grid operations, are complex and often lack automated interpretation solutions, which hinders industry expansion and undermines profitability for electricity companies. We introduce GridCodex, an end to end framework for grid code reasoning and compliance that leverages large language models and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Our framework advances conventional RAG workflows through multi stage query refinement and enhanced retrieval with RAPTOR. We validate the effectiveness of GridCodex with comprehensive benchmarks, including automated answer assessment across multiple dimensions and regulatory agencies. Experimental results showcase a 26.4% improvement in answer quality and more than a 10 fold increase in recall rate. An ablation study further examines the impact of base model selection.</p></details> |  |

We assess the reliability of synthetic benchmarks across two experiments: one varying retriever parameters while keeping the generator fixed, and another varying the generator with fixed retriever parameters. Across four datasets, of which two open-domain and two proprietary, we find that synthetic benchmarks reliably rank the RAGs varying in terms of retriever configuration, aligning well with human-labeled benchmark baselines. However, they fail to produce consistent RAG rankings when comparing generator architectures. The breakdown possibly arises from a combination of task mismatch between the synthetic and human benchmarks, and stylistic bias favoring certain generators.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for the SynDAiTE workshop at the European Conference on Machine Learning and Principles and Practice of Knowledge Discovery in Databases (ECML-PKDD 2025), September 15, 2025 - Porto, Portugal</p></details> |
| **[RAG for Geoscience: What We Expect, Gaps and Opportunities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11246v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances language models by combining retrieval with generation. However, its current workflow remains largely text-centric, limiting its applicability in geoscience. Many geoscientific tasks are inherently evidence-hungry. Typical examples involve imputing missing observations using analog scenes, retrieving equations and parameters to calibrate models, geolocating field photos based on visual cues, or surfacing historical case studies to support policy analyses. A simple ``retrieve-then-generate'' pipeline is insufficient for these needs. We envision Geo-RAG, a next-generation paradigm that reimagines RAG as a modular retrieve $\rightarrow$ reason $\rightarrow$ generate $\rightarrow$ verify loop. Geo-RAG supports four core capabilities: (i) retrieval of multi-modal Earth data; (ii) reasoning under physical and domain constraints; (iii) generation of science-grade artifacts; and (iv) verification of generated hypotheses against numerical models, ground measurements, and expert assessments. This shift opens new opportunities for more trustworthy and transparent geoscience workflows.</p></details> |  |

| **[ComoRAG: A Cognitive-Inspired Memory-Organized RAG for Stateful Long Narrative Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10419v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Narrative comprehension on long stories and novels has been a challenging domain attributed to their intricate plotlines and entangled, often evolving relations among characters and entities. Given the LLM's diminished reasoning over extended context and high computational cost, retrieval-based approaches remain a pivotal role in practice. However, traditional RAG methods can fall short due to their stateless, single-step retrieval process, which often overlooks the dynamic nature of capturing interconnected relations within long-range context. In this work, we propose ComoRAG, holding the principle that narrative reasoning is not a one-shot process, but a dynamic, evolving interplay between new evidence acquisition and past knowledge consolidation, analogous to human cognition when reasoning with memory-related signals in the brain. Specifically, when encountering a reasoning impasse, ComoRAG undergoes iterative reasoning cycles while interacting with a dynamic memory workspace. In each cycle, it generates probing queries to devise new exploratory paths, then integrates the retrieved evidence of new aspects into a global memory pool, thereby supporting the emergence of a coherent context for the query resolution. Across four challenging long-context narrative benchmarks (200K+ tokens), ComoRAG outperforms strong RAG baselines with consistent relative gains up to 11% compared to the strongest baseline. Further analysis reveals that ComoRAG is particularly advantageous for complex queries requiring global comprehension, offering a principled, cognitively motivated paradigm for retrieval-based long context comprehension towards stateful reasoning.

Within financial sectors, modern enterprises increasingly rely on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems to address complex compliance requirements in financial document workflows. However, existing solutions struggle to account for the inherent heterogeneity of data (e.g., text, tables, diagrams) and evolving nature of regulatory standards used in financial filings, leading to compromised accuracy in critical information extraction. We propose the FinSage framework as a solution, utilizing a multi-aspect RAG framework tailored for regulatory compliance analysis in multi-modal financial documents. FinSage introduces three innovative components: (1) a multi-modal pre-processing pipeline that unifies diverse data formats and generates chunk-level metadata summaries, (2) a multi-path sparse-dense retrieval system augmented with query expansion (HyDE) and metadata-aware semantic search, and (3) a domain-specialized re-ranking module fine-tuned via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to prioritize compliance-critical content. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FinSage achieves an impressive recall of 92.51% on 75 expert-curated questions derived from surpasses the best baseline method on the FinanceBench question answering datasets by 24.06% in accuracy. Moreover, FinSage has been successfully deployed as financial question-answering agent in online meetings, where it has already served more than 1,200 people.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 34th ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM2025)</p></details> |

Auditing Membership Leakage in Semi-Black-box RAG Controlling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09105v2)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and its Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MRAG) significantly improve the knowledge coverage and contextual understanding of Large Language Models (LLMs) by introducing external knowledge sources. However, retrieval and multimodal fusion obscure content provenance, rendering existing membership inference methods unable to reliably attribute generated outputs to pre-training, external retrieval, or user input, thus undermining privacy leakage accountability To address these challenges, we propose the first Source-aware Membership Audit (SMA) that enables fine-grained source attribution of generated content in a semi-black-box setting with retrieval control capabilities. To address the environmental constraints of semi-black-box auditing, we further design an attribution estimation mechanism based on zero-order optimization, which robustly approximates the true influence of input tokens on the output through large-scale perturbation sampling and ridge regression modeling. In addition, SMA introduces a cross-modal attribution technique that projects image inputs into textual descriptions via MLLMs, enabling token-level attribution in the text modality, which for the first time facilitates membership inference on image retrieval traces in MRAG systems. This work shifts the focus of membership inference from 'whether the data has been memorized' to 'where the content is sourced from', offering a novel perspective for auditing data provenance in complex generative systems.</p></details> |  |

Data augmentation can potentially alleviate the data shortage, but augmenting vulnerable code is challenging and requires a generative solution that maintains vulnerability. Previous works have only focused on generating samples that contain single statements or specific types of vulnerabilities. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been used to solve various code generation and comprehension tasks with inspiring results, especially when fused with retrieval augmented generation (RAG). Therefore, we propose VulScribeR, a novel LLM-based solution that leverages carefully curated prompt templates to augment vulnerable datasets. More specifically, we explore three strategies to augment both single and multi-statement vulnerabilities, with LLMs, namely Mutation, Injection, and Extension. Our extensive evaluation across four vulnerability datasets and DLVD models, using three LLMs, show that our approach beats two SOTA methods Vulgen and VGX, and Random Oversampling (ROS) by 27.48%, 27.93%, and 15.41% in f1-score with 5K generated vulnerable samples on average, and 53.84%, 54.10%, 69.90%, and 40.93% with 15K generated vulnerable samples. Our approach demonstrates its feasibility for large-scale data augmentation by generating 1K samples at as cheap as US$ 1.88.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by TOSEM; 26 pages, 6 figures, 8 tables, 3 prompt templates, 1 algorithm</p></details> |

These systems face challenges in understanding and generating authentic Cantonese colloquial expressions due to limited annotated data and linguistic variability. The review evaluates the integration of LoRA within RAG frameworks, benchmarks PEFT methods for retrieval and generation accuracy, identify domain adaptation strategies under limited data, and compares fine-tuning techniques aimed at improving semantic fidelity under data-scarce conditions. A systematic analysis of recent studies employing diverse LoRA variants, synthetic data generation, user feedback integration, and adaptive parameter allocation was conducted to assess their impact on computational efficiency, retrieval precision, linguistic authenticity, and scalability. Findings reveal that dynamic and ensemble LoRA adaptations significantly reduce trainable parameters without sacrificing retrieval accuracy and generation quality in dialectal contexts. However, limitations remain in fully preserving fine-grained linguistic nuances, especially for low-resource settings like Cantonese. The integration of real-time user feedback and domain-specific data remains underdeveloped, limiting model adaptability and personalization. While selective parameter freezing and nonlinear adaptation methods offer better trade-offs between efficiency and accuracy, their robustness at scale remains an open challenge. This review highlights the promise of PEFT-enhanced RAG systems for domain-specific language tasks and calls for future work targeting dialectal authenticity, dynamic adaptation, and scalable fine-tuning pipelines.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 1 figure, 8 tables</p></details> |

These limitations manifest as two key challenges: pervasive misinformation in the web environment, which introduces unreliable or misleading content that can degrade retrieval accuracy, and the underutilization of web tools, which, if effectively employed, could enhance query precision and help mitigate this noise, ultimately improving the retrieval results in RAG systems. To address these issues, we propose WebFilter, a novel RAG framework that generates source-restricted queries and filters out unreliable content. This approach combines a retrieval filtering mechanism with a behavior- and outcome-driven reward strategy, optimizing both query formulation and retrieval outcomes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that WebFilter improves answer quality and retrieval precision, outperforming existing RAG methods on both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

However, user understanding, practices and expectations regarding these memory systems are not yet well understood. This paper presents a thematic analysis of semi-structured interviews with 18 users to explore their mental models of LLM's Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)-based memory, current usage practices, perceived benefits and drawbacks, privacy concerns and expectations for future memory systems. Our findings reveal diverse and often incomplete mental models of how memory operates. While users appreciate the potential for enhanced personalization and efficiency, significant concerns exist regarding privacy, control and the accuracy of remembered information. Users express a desire for granular control over memory generation, management, usage and updating, including clear mechanisms for reviewing, editing, deleting and categorizing memories, as well as transparent insight into how memories and inferred information are used. We discuss design implications for creating more user-centric, transparent, and trustworthy LLM memory systems.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods primarily focus on improving retrieval and rely on large language models (LLMs) to implicitly integrate the retrieved context with the query. However, such models are often sensitive to retrieval quality and may generate responses that are misaligned with user preferences. To address this limitation, we propose PrLM, a reinforcement learning framework that trains LLMs to explicitly reason over retrieved user profiles. Guided by a contrastively trained personalization reward model, PrLM effectively learns from user responses without requiring annotated reasoning paths. Experiments on three personalized text generation datasets show that PrLM outperforms existing methods and remains robust across varying numbers of retrieved profiles and different retrievers.</p></details> |  |

We present classification using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which shifts traditional classification tasks from determining the correct category in accordance with pre-trained parameters to evaluating content in relation to contextual knowledge retrieved at inference. In hate speech detection, this transforms the task from "is this hate speech?" to "does this violate the hate speech policy?" Our Contextual Policy Engine (CPE) - an agentic RAG system - demonstrates this approach and offers three key advantages: (1) robust classification accuracy comparable to leading commercial systems, (2) inherent explainability via retrieved policy segments, and (3) dynamic policy updates without model retraining. Through three experiments, we demonstrate strong baseline performance and show that the system can apply fine-grained policy control by correctly adjusting protection for specific identity groups without requiring retraining or compromising overall performance. These findings establish that RAG can transform classification into a more flexible, transparent, and adaptable process for content moderation and wider classification problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[You Don't Need Pre-built Graphs for RAG: Retrieval Augmented Generation with Adaptive Reasoning Structures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06105v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) often suffer from hallucination, generating factually incorrect statements when handling questions beyond their knowledge and perception. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) addresses this by retrieving query-relevant contexts from knowledge bases to support LLM reasoning. Recent advances leverage pre-constructed graphs to capture the relational connections among distributed documents, showing remarkable performance in complex tasks. However, existing Graph-based RAG (GraphRAG) methods rely on a costly process to transform the corpus into a graph, introducing overwhelming token cost and update latency. Moreover, real-world queries vary in type and complexity, requiring different logic structures for accurate reasoning. The pre-built graph may not align with these required structures, resulting in ineffective knowledge retrieval. To this end, we propose a \textbf{\underline{Logic}}-aware \textbf{\underline{R}}etrieval-\textbf{\underline{A}}ugmented \textbf{\underline{G}}eneration framework (\textbf{LogicRAG}) that dynamically extracts reasoning structures at inference time to guide adaptive retrieval without any pre-built graph. LogicRAG begins by decomposing the input query into a set of subproblems and constructing a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to model the logical dependencies among them. To support coherent multi-step reasoning, LogicRAG then linearizes the graph using topological sort, so that subproblems can be addressed in a logically consistent order. Besides, LogicRAG applies graph pruning to reduce redundant retrieval and uses context pruning to filter irrelevant context, significantly reducing the overall token cost. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LogicRAG achieves both superior performance and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |

While GraphRAG has shown promise for multi-hop reasoning and structured retrieval, its adoption has been limited by the high computational cost of constructing knowledge graphs using large language models (LLMs) and the latency of graph-based retrieval. To address these challenges, we introduce two core innovations: (1) a dependency-based knowledge graph construction pipeline that leverages industrial-grade NLP libraries to extract entities and relations from unstructured text completely eliminating reliance on LLMs; and (2) a lightweight graph retrieval strategy that combines hybrid query node identification with efficient one-hop traversal for high-recall, low-latency subgraph extraction. We evaluate our framework on two SAP datasets focused on legacy code migration and demonstrate strong empirical performance. Our system achieves up to 15% and 4.35% improvements over traditional RAG baselines based on LLM-as-Judge and RAGAS metrics, respectively. Moreover, our dependency-based construction approach attains 94% of the performance of LLM-generated knowledge graphs (61.87% vs. 65.83%) while significantly reducing cost and improving scalability. These results validate the feasibility of deploying GraphRAG systems in real-world, large-scale enterprise applications without incurring prohibitive resource requirements paving the way for practical, explainable, and domain-adaptable retrieval-augmented reasoning.</p></details> |  |

We introduce RankArena, a unified platform for comparing and analysing the performance of retrieval pipelines, rerankers, and RAG systems using structured human and LLM-based feedback as well as for collecting such feedback. RankArena supports multiple evaluation modes: direct reranking visualisation, blind pairwise comparisons with human or LLM voting, supervised manual document annotation, and end-to-end RAG answer quality assessment. It captures fine-grained relevance feedback through both pairwise preferences and full-list annotations, along with auxiliary metadata such as movement metrics, annotation time, and quality ratings. The platform also integrates LLM-as-a-judge evaluation, enabling comparison between model-generated rankings and human ground truth annotations. All interactions are stored as structured evaluation datasets that can be used to train rerankers, reward models, judgment agents, or retrieval strategy selectors.

Despite impressive advancements, vanilla RAG-based VQA methods that rely on unstructured documents and overlook the structural relationships among knowledge elements frequently introduce irrelevant or misleading content, reducing answer accuracy and reliability. To overcome these challenges, a promising solution is to integrate multimodal knowledge graphs (KGs) into RAG-based VQA frameworks to enhance the generation by introducing structured multimodal knowledge. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel multimodal knowledge-augmented generation framework (mKG-RAG) based on multimodal KGs for knowledge-intensive VQA tasks. Specifically, our approach leverages MLLM-powered keyword extraction and vision-text matching to distill semantically consistent and modality-aligned entities/relationships from multimodal documents, constructing high-quality multimodal KGs as structured knowledge representations. In addition, a dual-stage retrieval strategy equipped with a question-aware multimodal retriever is introduced to improve retrieval efficiency while refining precision. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods, setting a new state-of-the-art for knowledge-based VQA.</p></details> |  |

However, existing RAG methods typically retrieve from either text or images in isolation, limiting their ability to address complex queries that require multi-hop reasoning or up-to-date factual knowledge. To address this limitation, we propose QA-Dragon, a Query-Aware Dynamic RAG System for Knowledge-Intensive VQA. Specifically, QA-Dragon introduces a domain router to identify the query's subject domain for domain-specific reasoning, along with a search router that dynamically selects optimal retrieval strategies. By orchestrating both text and image search agents in a hybrid setup, our system supports multimodal, multi-turn, and multi-hop reasoning, enabling it to tackle complex VQA tasks effectively. We evaluate our QA-Dragon on the Meta CRAG-MM Challenge at KDD Cup 2025, where it significantly enhances the reasoning performance of base models under challenging scenarios. Our framework achieves substantial improvements in both answer accuracy and knowledge overlap scores, outperforming baselines by 5.06% on the single-source task, 6.35% on the multi-source task, and 5.03% on the multi-turn task.</p></details> | <details><summary>The s...</summary><p>The source code for our system is released in https://github.com/jzzzzh/QA-Dragon</p></details> |

Despite efforts to address challenges such as scaling model size and data volume, the cost associated with pre-training and fine-tuning remains substantial. However, pre-trained large multimodal models (LMMs) encounter a modality gap, characterised by a misalignment between textual and visual representations within a common embedding space. Although fine-tuning can potentially mitigate this gap, it is typically expensive and impractical due to the requirement for extensive domain-driven data. To overcome this challenge, we propose a lightweight training-free approach utilising Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to extend across the modality using a linear mapping, which can be computed efficiently. During inference, this mapping is applied to images embedded by an LMM enabling retrieval of closest textual descriptions from the training set. These textual descriptions, in conjunction with an instruction, cater as an input prompt for the language model to generate new textual descriptions. In addition, we introduce an iterative technique for distilling the mapping by generating synthetic descriptions via the language model facilitating optimisation for standard utilised image description measures. Experimental results on two benchmark multimodal datasets demonstrate significant improvements.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM CIKM 2025. 5 pages, 2 figures</p></details> |
| **[PAIRS: Parametric-Verified Adaptive Information Retrieval and Selection for Efficient RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04057v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a cornerstone technique for enhancing large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge. However, current RAG systems face two critical limitations: (1) they inefficiently retrieve information for every query, including simple questions that could be resolved using the LLM's parametric knowledge alone, and (2) they risk retrieving irrelevant documents when queries contain sparse information signals. To address these gaps, we introduce Parametric-verified Adaptive Information Retrieval and Selection (PAIRS), a training-free framework that integrates parametric and retrieved knowledge to adaptively determine whether to retrieve and how to select external information. Specifically, PAIRS employs a dual-path generation mechanism: First, the LLM produces both a direct answer and a context-augmented answer using self-generated pseudo-context. When these outputs converge, PAIRS bypasses external retrieval entirely, dramatically improving the RAG system's efficiency. For divergent cases, PAIRS activates a dual-path retrieval (DPR) process guided by both the original query and self-generated contextual signals, followed by an Adaptive Information Selection (AIS) module that filters documents through weighted similarity to both sources. This simple yet effective approach can not only enhance efficiency by eliminating unnecessary retrievals but also improve accuracy through contextually guided retrieval and adaptive information selection. Experimental results on six question-answering (QA) benchmarks show that PAIRS reduces retrieval costs by around 25% (triggering for only 75% of queries) while still improving accuracy-achieving +1.1% EM and +1.0% F1 over prior baselines on average.</p></details> |  |

Semantic variability across domains like medicine, networking, or law hampers RAG's context precision, while fine-tuning solutions are costly, slow, and lack generalization as new data emerges. Achieving zero-shot precision with retrievers without fine-tuning still remains a key challenge. We introduce 'MetaGen Blended RAG', a novel enterprise search approach that enhances semantic retrievers through a metadata generation pipeline and hybrid query indexes using dense and sparse vectors. By leveraging key concepts, topics, and acronyms, our method creates metadata-enriched semantic indexes and boosted hybrid queries, delivering robust, scalable performance without fine-tuning. On the biomedical PubMedQA dataset, MetaGen Blended RAG achieves 82% retrieval accuracy and 77% RAG accuracy, surpassing all prior zero-shot RAG benchmarks and even rivaling fine-tuned models on that dataset, while also excelling on datasets like SQuAD and NQ. This approach redefines enterprise search using a new approach to building semantic retrievers with unmatched generalization across specialized domains.</p></details> |  |

To address these issues, the retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework enhances LLMs with access to external knowledge via a retriever, enabling more accurate and real-time outputs about the latest events. However, this integration brings new security vulnerabilities: the risk that malicious content in the external database can be retrieved and used to manipulate model outputs. Although prior work has explored attacks on RAG systems, existing approaches either rely heavily on access to the retriever or fail to jointly consider both retrieval and generation stages, limiting their effectiveness, particularly in black-box scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose Token-level Precise Attack on the RAG (TPARAG), a novel framework that targets both white-box and black-box RAG systems. TPARAG leverages a lightweight white-box LLM as an attacker to generate and iteratively optimize malicious passages at the token level, ensuring both retrievability and high attack success in generation. Extensive experiments on open-domain QA datasets demonstrate that TPARAG consistently outperforms previous approaches in retrieval-stage and end-to-end attack effectiveness. These results further reveal critical vulnerabilities in RAG pipelines and offer new insights into improving their robustness.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Multi-Round Diagnostic RAG Framework for Emulating Clinical Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07724v2)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, accurately and quickly deploying medical large language models (LLMs) has become a trend. Among these, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has garnered attention due to rapid deployment and privacy protection. However, the challenge hinder the practical deployment of RAG for medical diagnosis: the semantic gap between colloquial patient descriptions and the professional terminology within medical knowledge bases. We try to address the challenge from the data perspective and the method perspective. First, to address the semantic gap in existing knowledge bases, we construct DiagnosGraph, a generalist knowledge graph covering both modern medicine and Traditional Chinese Medicine. It contains 876 common diseases with the graph of 7,997 nodes and 37,201 triples. To bridge the gap between colloquial patient narratives and academic medical knowledge, DiagnosGraph also introduces $1,908$ medical record by formalizing the patient chief complaint and proposing a medical diagnosis. Second, we introduce the Multi-Round Diagnostic RAG (MRD-RAG) framework. It utilizes a multi-round dialogue to refine diagnostic possibilities, emulating the clinical reasoning of a physician. Experiments conducted on four medical benchmarks, with evaluations by human physicians, demonstrate that MRD-RAG enhances the diagnostic performance of LLMs, highlighting its potential to make automated diagnosis more accurate and human-aligned.</p></details> |  |
| **[Highlight & Summarize: RAG without the jailbreaks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02872v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Preventing jailbreaking and model hijacking of Large Language Models (LLMs) is an important yet challenging task. For example, when interacting with a chatbot, malicious users can input specially crafted prompts to cause the LLM to generate undesirable content or perform a completely different task from its intended purpose. Existing mitigations for such attacks typically rely on hardening the LLM's system prompt or using a content classifier trained to detect undesirable content or off-topic conversations. However, these probabilistic approaches are relatively easy to bypass due to the very large space of possible inputs and undesirable outputs. In this paper, we present and evaluate Highlight & Summarize (H&S), a new design pattern for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems that prevents these attacks by design. The core idea is to perform the same task as a standard RAG pipeline (i.e., to provide natural language answers to questions, based on relevant sources) without ever revealing the user's question to the generative LLM. This is achieved by splitting the pipeline into two components: a highlighter, which takes the user's question and extracts relevant passages ("highlights") from the retrieved documents, and a summarizer, which takes the highlighted passages and summarizes them into a cohesive answer. We describe several possible instantiations of H&S and evaluate their generated responses in terms of correctness, relevance, and response quality. Surprisingly, when using an LLM-based highlighter, the majority of H&S responses are judged to be better than those of a standard RAG pipeline.</p></details> |  |
| **[Meta-RAG on Large Codebases Using Code Summarization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02611v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM) systems have been at the forefront of applied Artificial Intelligence (AI) research in a multitude of domains. One such domain is software development, where researchers have pushed the automation of a number of code tasks through LLM agents. Software development is a complex ecosystem, that stretches far beyond code implementation and well into the realm of code maintenance. In this paper, we propose a multi-agent system to localize bugs in large pre-existing codebases using information retrieval and LLMs. Our system introduces a novel Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approach, Meta-RAG, where we utilize summaries to condense codebases by an average of 79.8\%, into a compact, structured, natural language representation. We then use an LLM agent to determine which parts of the codebase are critical for bug resolution, i.e. bug localization. We demonstrate the usefulness of Meta-RAG through evaluation with the SWE-bench Lite dataset. Meta-RAG scores 84.67 % and 53.0 % for file-level and function-level correct localization rates, respectively, achieving state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Simple Methods Defend RAG Systems Well Against Real-World Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02296v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring safety and in-domain responses for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems is paramount in safety-critical applications, yet remains a significant challenge. To address this, we evaluate four methodologies for Out-Of-Domain (OOD) query detection: GPT-4o, regression-based, Principal Component Analysis (PCA)-based, and Neural Collapse (NC), to ensure the RAG system only responds to queries confined to the system's knowledge base. Specifically, our evaluation explores two novel dimensionality reduction and feature separation strategies: \textit{PCA}, where top components are selected using explained variance or OOD separability, and an adaptation of \textit{Neural Collapse Feature Separation}. We validate our approach on standard datasets (StackExchange and MSMARCO) and real-world applications (Substance Use and COVID-19), including tests against LLM-simulated and actual attacks on a COVID-19 vaccine chatbot. Through human and LLM-based evaluations of response correctness and relevance, we confirm that an external OOD detector is crucial for maintaining response relevance.</p></details> |  |

| **[Adaptive Event-Triggered Policy Gradient for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20338v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conventional multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) methods rely on time-triggered execution, where agents sample and communicate actions at fixed intervals. This approach is often computationally expensive and communication-intensive. To address this limitation, we propose ET-MAPG (Event-Triggered Multi-Agent Policy Gradient reinforcement learning), a framework that jointly learns an agent's control policy and its event-triggering policy. Unlike prior work that decouples these mechanisms, ET-MAPG integrates them into a unified learning process, enabling agents to learn not only what action to take but also when to execute it. For scenarios with inter-agent communication, we introduce AET-MAPG, an attention-based variant that leverages a self-attention mechanism to learn selective communication patterns. AET-MAPG empowers agents to determine not only when to trigger an action but also with whom to communicate and what information to exchange, thereby optimizing coordination. Both methods can be integrated with any policy gradient MARL algorithm. Extensive experiments across diverse MARL benchmarks demonstrate that our approaches achieve performance comparable to state-of-the-art, time-triggered baselines while significantly reducing both computational load and communication overhead.</p></details> |  |
| **[A co-evolving agentic AI system for medical imaging analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20279v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agentic AI is rapidly advancing in healthcare and biomedical research. However, in medical image analysis, their performance and adoption remain limited due to the lack of a robust ecosystem, insufficient toolsets, and the absence of real-time interactive expert feedback. Here we present "TissueLab", a co-evolving agentic AI system that allows researchers to ask direct questions, automatically plan and generate explainable workflows, and conduct real-time analyses where experts can visualize intermediate results and refine them. TissueLab integrates tool factories across pathology, radiology, and spatial omics domains. By standardizing inputs, outputs, and capabilities of diverse tools, the system determines when and how to invoke them to address research and clinical questions. Across diverse tasks with clinically meaningful quantifications that inform staging, prognosis, and treatment planning, TissueLab achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with end-to-end vision-language models (VLMs) and other agentic AI systems such as GPT-5. Moreover, TissueLab continuously learns from clinicians, evolving toward improved classifiers and more effective decision strategies. With active learning, it delivers accurate results in unseen disease contexts within minutes, without requiring massive datasets or prolonged retraining. Released as a sustainable open-source ecosystem, TissueLab aims to accelerate computational research and translational adoption in medical imaging while establishing a foundation for the next generation of medical AI.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scan-do Attitude: Towards Autonomous CT Protocol Management using a Large Language Model Agent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20270v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Managing scan protocols in Computed Tomography (CT), which includes adjusting acquisition parameters or configuring reconstructions, as well as selecting postprocessing tools in a patient-specific manner, is time-consuming and requires clinical as well as technical expertise. At the same time, we observe an increasing shortage of skilled workforce in radiology. To address this issue, a Large Language Model (LLM)-based agent framework is proposed to assist with the interpretation and execution of protocol configuration requests given in natural language or a structured, device-independent format, aiming to improve the workflow efficiency and reduce technologists' workload. The agent combines in-context-learning, instruction-following, and structured toolcalling abilities to identify relevant protocol elements and apply accurate modifications. In a systematic evaluation, experimental results indicate that the agent can effectively retrieve protocol components, generate device compatible protocol definition files, and faithfully implement user requests. Despite demonstrating feasibility in principle, the approach faces limitations regarding syntactic and semantic validity due to lack of a unified device API, and challenges with ambiguous or complex requests. In summary, the findings show a clear path towards LLM-based agents for supporting scan protocol management in CT imaging.</p></details> |  |
| **[Minimum Time Consensus of Multi-agent System under Fuel Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19927v3)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work addresses the problem of finding minimum time consensus point in the state space for a set of $N$ identical double integrator agents with bounded inputs and fixed fuel budget constraint. To address the problem, characterization of the attainable set for each agent subject to bounded inputs and fixed fuel budget constraints is done. Such attainable set is shown to be a convex set. The minimum time to consensus is the least time when the attainable sets of all agents intersect and the corresponding consensus state is the point of intersection. Using Helly's theorem, it is shown that the intersection is not empty at the time when all triplets of agents exhibit a non-empty intersection. Thus, a closed-form expression for the minimum time to consensus for a triplet of agents is obtained. The calculation of minimum time consensus for each of the triplets is performed independently and is distributed evenly among $N$ agents. The overall minimum time to consensus of $N$ agents is then given by the triplet that has the greatest minimum time to consensus. In the process, the set of initial conditions for agents from which consensus is possible under these input and fuel budget constraints is also characterized.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches to synthetic tool-use data generation tend to be non-interactive, and/or non-compositional. We introduce RandomWorld, a pipeline for the procedural generation of interactive tools and compositional tool-use data. We show that models tuned via SFT and RL on synthetic RandomWorld data improve on a range of tool-use benchmarks, and set the new SoTA for two metrics on the NESTFUL dataset. Further experiments show that downstream performance scales with the amount of RandomWorld-generated training data, opening up the possibility of further improvement through the use of entirely synthetic data.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 3 figures; accepted at EMNLP 2025</p></details> |
| **[Automated Multi-Agent Workflows for RTL Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20182v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of agentic AI workflows unlocks novel opportunities for computer systems design and optimization. However, for specialized domains such as program synthesis, the relative scarcity of HDL and proprietary EDA resources online compared to more common programming tasks introduces challenges, often necessitating task-specific fine-tuning, high inference costs, and manually-crafted agent orchestration. In this work, we present VeriMaAS, a multi-agent framework designed to automatically compose agentic workflows for RTL code generation. Our key insight is to integrate formal verification feedback from HDL tools directly into workflow generation, reducing the cost of gradient-based updates or prolonged reasoning traces. Our method improves synthesis performance by 5-7% for pass@k over fine-tuned baselines, while requiring only a few hundred training examples, representing an order-of-magnitude reduction in supervision cost.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted: ML for Systems Workshop NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

FoA introduces Versioned Capability Vectors (VCVs): machine-readable profiles that make agent capabilities searchable through semantic embeddings, enabling agents to advertise their capabilities, cost, and limitations. Our aarchitecturecombines three key innovations: (1) semantic routing that matches tasks to agents over sharded HNSW indices while enforcing operational constraints through cost-biased optimization, (2) dynamic task decomposition where compatible agents collaboratively break down complex tasks into DAGs of subtasks through consensus-based merging, and (3) smart clustering that groups agents working on similar subtasks into collaborative channels for k-round refinement before synthesis. Built on top of MQTT,s publish-subscribe semantics for scalable message passing, FoA achieves sub-linear complexity through hierarchical capability matching and efficient index maintenance. Evaluation on HealthBench shows 13x improvements over single-model baselines, with clustering-enhanced laboration particularly effective for complex reasoning tasks requiring multiple perspectives. The system scales horizontally while maintaining consistent performance, demonstrating that semantic orchestration with structured collaboration can unlock the collective intelligence of heterogeneous federations of AI agents.</p></details> | 18 pages, 4 figures |
| **[VisualTrap: A Stealthy Backdoor Attack on GUI Agents via Visual Grounding Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06899v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents powered by Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have emerged as a revolutionary approach to automating human-machine interactions, capable of autonomously operating personal devices (e.g., mobile phones) or applications within the device to perform complex real-world tasks in a human-like manner. However, their close integration with personal devices raises significant security concerns, with many threats, including backdoor attacks, remaining largely unexplored. This work reveals that the visual grounding of GUI agent-mapping textual plans to GUI elements-can introduce vulnerabilities, enabling new types of backdoor attacks. With backdoor attack targeting visual grounding, the agent's behavior can be compromised even when given correct task-solving plans. To validate this vulnerability, we propose VisualTrap, a method that can hijack the grounding by misleading the agent to locate textual plans to trigger locations instead of the intended targets. VisualTrap uses the common method of injecting poisoned data for attacks, and does so during the pre-training of visual grounding to ensure practical feasibility of attacking. Empirical results show that VisualTrap can effectively hijack visual grounding with as little as 5% poisoned data and highly stealthy visual triggers (invisible to the human eye); and the attack can be generalized to downstream tasks, even after clean fine-tuning. Moreover, the injected trigger can remain effective across different GUI environments, e.g., being trained on mobile/web and generalizing to desktop environments. These findings underscore the urgent need for further research on backdoor attack risks in GUI agents.</p></details> | Accepted in COLM2025 |
| **[Optimal Multi-agent Path Finding in Continuous Time](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16410v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continuous-time Conflict Based-Search (CCBS) has long been viewed as the standard optimal baseline for multi-agent path finding in continuous time (MAPFR), yet recent critiques show that the theoretically described CCBS can fail to terminate on solvable MAPFR problems while the publicly available reference implementation can return sub-optimal solutions. This work presents an analytical framework that yields simple and sufficient conditions under which any CCBS-style algorithm is both sound and solution complete. Investigating the reference CCBS implementation reveals that it violates our sufficient conditions for soundness, with counterexamples demonstrating sub-optimality. Leveraging the framework, we introduce a branching rule ($\delta$-BR) and prove it restores soundness and termination guarantees. Consequently, the resulting CCBS variant is both sound and solution complete. To our knowledge, this is the first MAPFR solver matching the guarantees of the discrete-time CBS. On a constructed example, CCBS with $\delta$-BR improves sum-of-costs from 10.707 to 9.000 ($\approx$ 16% lower) compared to the reference CCBS implementation. Across benchmarks, the reference CCBS implementation is generally able to find solutions faster than CCBS with $\delta$-BR due to its more aggressive pruning. However, this comes at the cost of occasional sub-optimality and potential non-termination when all solutions are pruned, whereas $\delta$-BR preserves optimality and guarantees termination by design. Because $\delta$-BR largely only affects the branching step, it can be adopted as a drop-in replacement in existing codebases. Beyond CCBS, the analytical framework and termination criterion provide a systematic way to evaluate other CCBS-like MAPFR solvers and future extensions, thereby offering tools for rigorous analysis of next-generation MAPFR algorithms.</p></details> | 35 pages |
| **[An Empirical Study of Testing Practices in Open Source AI Agent Frameworks and Agentic Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19185v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation model (FM)-based AI agents are rapidly gaining adoption across diverse domains, but their inherent non-determinism and non-reproducibility pose testing and quality assurance challenges. While recent benchmarks provide task-level evaluations, there is limited understanding of how developers verify the internal correctness of these agents during development. To address this gap, we conduct the first large-scale empirical study of testing practices in the AI agent ecosystem, analyzing 39 open-source agent frameworks and 439 agentic applications. We identify ten distinct testing patterns and find that novel, agent-specific methods like DeepEval are seldom used (around 1%), while traditional patterns like negative and membership testing are widely adapted to manage FM uncertainty. By mapping these patterns to canonical architectural components of agent frameworks and agentic applications, we uncover a fundamental inversion of testing effort: deterministic components like Resource Artifacts (tools) and Coordination Artifacts (workflows) consume over 70% of testing effort, while the FM-based Plan Body receives less than 5%. Crucially, this reveals a critical blind spot, as the Trigger component (prompts) remains neglected, appearing in around 1% of all tests. Our findings offer the first empirical testing baseline in FM-based agent frameworks and agentic applications, revealing a rational but incomplete adaptation to non-determinism. To address it, framework developers should improve support for novel testing methods, application developers must adopt prompt regression testing, and researchers should explore barriers to adoption. Strengthening these practices is vital for building more robust and dependable AI agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring Explainable Multi-agent MCTS-minimax Hybrids in Board Game Using Process Mining](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23326v3)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is a family of sampling-based search algorithms widely used for online planning in sequential decision-making domains and at the heart of many recent advances in artificial intelligence. Understanding the behavior of MCTS agents is difficult for developers and users due to the frequently large and complex search trees that result from the simulation of many possible futures, their evaluations, and their relationships. This paper presents our ongoing investigation into potential explanations for the decision-making and behavior of MCTS. A weakness of MCTS is that it constructs a highly selective tree and, as a result, can miss crucial moves and fall into tactical traps. Full-width minimax search constitutes the solution. We integrate shallow minimax search into the rollout phase of multi-agent MCTS and use process mining technique to explain agents' strategies in 3v3 checkers.</p></details> | <details><summary>38 pa...</summary><p>38 pages, AAAI 2025 PRL</p></details> |
| **[Emergent Risk Awareness in Rational Agents under Resource Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23436v4)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advanced reasoning models with agentic capabilities (AI agents) are deployed to interact with humans and to solve sequential decision-making problems under (approximate) utility functions and internal models. When such problems have resource or failure constraints where action sequences may be forcibly terminated once resources are exhausted, agents face implicit trade-offs that reshape their utility-driven (rational) behaviour. Additionally, since these agents are typically commissioned by a human principal to act on their behalf, asymmetries in constraint exposure can give rise to previously unanticipated misalignment between human objectives and agent incentives. We formalise this setting through a survival bandit framework, provide theoretical and empirical results that quantify the impact of survival-driven preference shifts, identify conditions under which misalignment emerges and propose mechanisms to mitigate the emergence of risk-seeking or risk-averse behaviours. As a result, this work aims to increase understanding and interpretability of emergent behaviours of AI agents operating under such survival pressure, and offer guidelines for safely deploying such AI systems in critical resource-limited environments.</p></details> |  |

The proposed approach augments control barrier functions with a novel $\psi$-weighted formulation that encodes directional control alignment between agents into the safety constraints. Deterministic admissibility is combined with empirical validation via Monte Carlo rollouts, and a PAC-style guarantee is derived based on margin-aware safety violations to provide a probabilistic safety certificate. The results from the experiments conducted under different bounded stochastic disturbances validate the feasibility of the proposed approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[MACD: Multi-Agent Clinical Diagnosis with Self-Learned Knowledge for LLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20067v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated notable potential in medical applications, yet they face substantial challenges in handling complex real-world clinical diagnoses using conventional prompting methods. Current prompt engineering and multi-agent approaches typically optimize isolated inferences, neglecting the accumulation of reusable clinical experience. To address this, this study proposes a novel Multi-Agent Clinical Diagnosis (MACD) framework, which allows LLMs to self-learn clinical knowledge via a multi-agent pipeline that summarizes, refines, and applies diagnostic insights. It mirrors how physicians develop expertise through experience, enabling more focused and accurate diagnosis on key disease-specific cues. We further extend it to a MACD-human collaborative workflow, where multiple LLM-based diagnostician agents engage in iterative consultations, supported by an evaluator agent and human oversight for cases where agreement is not reached. Evaluated on 4,390 real-world patient cases across seven diseases using diverse open-source LLMs (Llama-3.1 8B/70B, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama 70B), MACD significantly improves primary diagnostic accuracy, outperforming established clinical guidelines with gains up to 22.3% (MACD). On the subset of the data, it achieves performance on par with or exceeding that of human physicians (up to 16% improvement over physicians-only diagnosis). Additionally, on the MACD-human workflow, it achieves an 18.6% improvement compared to physicians-only diagnosis. Moreover, self-learned knowledge exhibits strong cross-model stability, transferability, and model-specific personalization, while the system can generate traceable rationales, enhancing explainability. Consequently, this work presents a scalable self-learning paradigm for LLM-assisted diagnosis, bridging the gap between the intrinsic knowledge of LLMs and real-world clinical practice.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Agents are Social Groups: Investigating Social Influence of Multiple Agents in Human-Agent Interactions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04578v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent systems - systems with multiple independent AI agents working together to achieve a common goal - are becoming increasingly prevalent in daily life. Drawing inspiration from the phenomenon of human group social influence, we investigate whether a group of AI agents can create social pressure on users to agree with them, potentially changing their stance on a topic. We conducted a study in which participants discussed social issues with either a single or multiple AI agents, and where the agents either agreed or disagreed with the user's stance on the topic. We found that conversing with multiple agents (holding conversation content constant) increased the social pressure felt by participants, and caused a greater shift in opinion towards the agents' stances on each topic. Our study shows the potential advantages of multi-agent systems over single-agent platforms in causing opinion change. We discuss design implications for possible multi-agent systems that promote social good, as well as the potential for malicious actors to use these systems to manipulate public opinion.</p></details> |  |
| **[Combating the Memory Walls: Optimization Pathways for Long-Context Agentic LLM Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09505v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs now form the backbone of AI agents for a diverse array of applications, including tool use, command-line agents, and web or computer use agents. These agentic LLM inference tasks are fundamentally different from chatbot-focused inference -- they often have much larger context lengths to capture complex, prolonged inputs, such as entire webpage DOMs or complicated tool call trajectories. This, in turn, generates significant off-chip memory traffic for the underlying hardware at the inference stage and causes the workload to be constrained by two memory walls, namely the bandwidth and capacity memory walls, preventing the on-chip compute units from achieving high utilization. In this paper, we introduce PLENA, a hardware-software co-designed system that applies three core optimization pathways to tackle these challenges. PLENA includes an efficient hardware implementation of compute and memory units supporting an asymmetric quantization scheme. PLENA also features a novel flattened systolic array architecture that has native support for FlashAttention to tackle these memory walls in the scenario of inference serving for long-context LLMs. Additionally, PLENA is developed with a complete stack, including a custom ISA, a compiler, a cycle-emulated simulator, and an automated design space exploration flow. The simulated results show that PLENA achieves up to 8.5x higher utilization than existing accelerators, and delivers 2.24x higher throughput than the A100 GPU and 3.85x higher throughput than the TPU v6e, under the same multiplier count and memory settings. The full PLENA system will also be open-sourced.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Language Barriers: Multi-Agent Coordination for Multi-Language Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19918v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Producing high-quality code across multiple programming languages is increasingly important as today's software systems are built on heterogeneous stacks. Large language models (LLMs) have advanced the state of automated programming, yet their proficiency varies sharply between languages, especially those with limited training data such as Rust, Perl, OCaml, and Erlang. Many current solutions including language-specific fine-tuning, multi-agent orchestration, transfer learning, and intermediate-representation pipelines still approach each target language in isolation, missing opportunities to share knowledge or exploit recurring cross-language patterns. XL-CoGen tackles this challenge with a coordinated multi-agent architecture that integrates intermediate representation, code generation, translation, and automated repair. Its distinguishing feature is a data-driven mechanism for selecting bridging languages: empirically derived transfer matrices identify the best intermediate languages based on demonstrated translation success rather than raw generation accuracy. The system performs early output validation, iteratively corrects errors, and reuses intermediate artifacts as contextual scaffolds for subsequent translations. Extensive experiments show that XL-CoGen yields notable improvements with 13 percentage-point gains over the strongest fine-tuned baseline and as much as 30 percentage points over existing single-language multi-agent methods. Ablation studies further demonstrate that compatibility-guided bridging significantly outperforms LLM-based heuristics, confirming the value of cumulative cross-language knowledge transfer.</p></details> |  |

However, deploying such agents in realistic human-centered scenarios, such as domestic households, remains challenging, particularly due to the difficulty of modeling individual human preferences and behaviors. In this work, we introduce PersONAL (PERSonalized Object Navigation And Localization, a comprehensive benchmark designed to study personalization in Embodied AI. Agents must identify, retrieve, and navigate to objects associated with specific users, responding to natural-language queries such as "find Lily's backpack". PersONAL comprises over 2,000 high-quality episodes across 30+ photorealistic homes from the HM3D dataset. Each episode includes a natural-language scene description with explicit associations between objects and their owners, requiring agents to reason over user-specific semantics. The benchmark supports two evaluation modes: (1) active navigation in unseen environments, and (2) object grounding in previously mapped scenes. Experiments with state-of-the-art baselines reveal a substantial gap to human performance, highlighting the need for embodied agents capable of perceiving, reasoning, and memorizing over personalized information; paving the way towards real-world assistive robot.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing methods rely on single-modal data sharing, limiting fusion performance, particularly in heterogeneous sensor settings involving both LiDAR and cameras across vehicles and roadside units (RSUs). To address this, we propose Radian Glue Attention (RG-Attn), a lightweight and generalizable cross-modal fusion module that unifies intra-agent and inter-agent fusion via transformation-based coordinate alignment and a unified sampling/inversion strategy. RG-Attn efficiently aligns features through a radian-based attention constraint, operating column-wise on geometrically consistent regions to reduce overhead and preserve spatial coherence, thereby enabling accurate and robust fusion. Building upon RG-Attn, we propose three cooperative architectures. The first, Paint-To-Puzzle (PTP), prioritizes communication efficiency but assumes all agents have LiDAR, optionally paired with cameras. The second, Co-Sketching-Co-Coloring (CoS-CoCo), offers maximal flexibility, supporting any sensor setup (e.g., LiDAR-only, camera-only, or both) and enabling strong cross-modal generalization for real-world deployment. The third, Pyramid-RG-Attn Fusion (PRGAF), aims for peak detection accuracy with the highest computational overhead. Extensive evaluations on simulated and real-world datasets show our framework delivers state-of-the-art detection accuracy with high flexibility and efficiency.

We developed a method for generating multiple homotopically distinct solutions for the multi-agent path planning problem in planar domains by combining our framework with revised prioritized planning and proved its completeness under specific assumptions. Experimentally, we demonstrated that our method is significantly faster than a method without Dynnikov coordinates. We also confirmed experimentally that homotopy-aware planning contributes to avoiding locally optimal solutions when searching for low-cost trajectories for a swarm of agents in a continuous environment.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages with 5 pages of references and appendices, 25 figures</p></details> |
| **[Agentic AI for Low-Altitude Semantic Wireless Networks: An Energy Efficient Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19791v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This letter addresses the energy efficiency issue in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted autonomous systems. We propose a framework for an agentic artificial intelligence (AI)-powered low-altitude semantic wireless network, that intelligently orchestrates a sense-communicate-decide-control workflow. A system-wide energy consumption minimization problem is formulated to enhance mission endurance. This problem holistically optimizes key operational variables, including UAV's location, semantic compression ratio, transmit power of the UAV and a mobile base station, and binary decision for AI inference task offloading, under stringent latency and quality-of-service constraints. To tackle the formulated mixed-integer non-convex problem, we develop a low-complexity algorithm which can obtain the globally optimal solution with two-dimensional search. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of our proposed design, demonstrating significant reductions in total energy consumption compared to conventional baseline approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[RDAR: Reward-Driven Agent Relevance Estimation for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19789v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human drivers focus only on a handful of agents at any one time. On the other hand, autonomous driving systems process complex scenes with numerous agents, regardless of whether they are pedestrians on a crosswalk or vehicles parked on the side of the road. While attention mechanisms offer an implicit way to reduce the input to the elements that affect decisions, existing attention mechanisms for capturing agent interactions are quadratic, and generally computationally expensive. We propose RDAR, a strategy to learn per-agent relevance -- how much each agent influences the behavior of the controlled vehicle -- by identifying which agents can be excluded from the input to a pre-trained behavior model. We formulate the masking procedure as a Markov Decision Process where the action consists of a binary mask indicating agent selection. We evaluate RDAR on a large-scale driving dataset, and demonstrate its ability to learn an accurate numerical measure of relevance by achieving comparable driving performance, in terms of overall progress, safety and performance, while processing significantly fewer agents compared to a state of the art behavior model.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Agentic Metacognition: Designing a "Self-Aware" Low-Code Agent for Failure Prediction and Human Handoff](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19783v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The inherent non-deterministic nature of autonomous agents, particularly within low-code/no-code (LCNC) environments, presents significant reliability challenges. Agents can become trapped in unforeseen loops, generate inaccurate outputs, or encounter unrecoverable failures, leading to user frustration and a breakdown of trust. This report proposes a novel architectural pattern to address these issues: the integration of a secondary, "metacognitive" layer that actively monitors the primary LCNC agent. Inspired by human introspection, this layer is designed to predict impending task failures based on a defined set of triggers, such as excessive latency or repetitive actions. Upon predicting a failure, the metacognitive agent proactively initiates a human handoff, providing the user with a clear summary of the agent's "thought process" and a detailed explanation of why it could not proceed. An empirical analysis of a prototype system demonstrates that this approach significantly increases the overall task success rate. However, this performance gain comes with a notable increase in computational overhead. The findings reframe human handoffs not as an admission of defeat but as a core design feature that enhances system resilience, improves user experience, and builds trust by providing transparency into the agent's internal state. The report discusses the practical and ethical implications of this approach and identifies key directions for future research.</p></details> | 7 pages, 2 tables |
| **[Measuring Harmfulness of Computer-Using Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00935v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computer-using agents (CUAs), which can autonomously control computers to perform multi-step actions, might pose significant safety risks if misused. However, existing benchmarks mainly evaluate LMs in chatbots or simple tool use. To more comprehensively evaluate CUAs' misuse risks, we introduce a new benchmark: CUAHarm. CUAHarm consists of 104 expert-written realistic misuse risks, such as disabling firewalls, leaking data, or installing backdoors. We provide a sandbox with rule-based verifiable rewards to measure CUAs' success rates in executing these tasks (e.g., whether the firewall is indeed disabled), beyond refusal rates. We evaluate frontier LMs including GPT-5, Claude 4 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Llama-3.3-70B, and Mistral Large 2. Even without jailbreaking prompts, these frontier LMs comply with executing these malicious tasks at a high success rate (e.g., 90\% for Gemini 2.5 Pro). Furthermore, while newer models are safer in previous safety benchmarks, their misuse risks as CUAs become even higher, e.g., Gemini 2.5 Pro is riskier than Gemini 1.5 Pro. Additionally, while these LMs are robust to common malicious prompts (e.g., creating a bomb) when acting as chatbots, they could still act unsafely as CUAs. We further evaluate a leading agentic framework (UI-TARS-1.5) and find that while it improves performance, it also amplifies misuse risks. To mitigate the misuse risks of CUAs, we explore using LMs to monitor CUAs' actions. We find monitoring unsafe computer-using actions is significantly harder than monitoring conventional unsafe chatbot responses. While monitoring chain-of-thoughts leads to modest gains, the average monitoring accuracy is only 77\%. A hierarchical summarization strategy improves performance by up to 13\%, a promising direction though monitoring remains unreliable. The benchmark will be released publicly to facilitate further research on mitigating these risks.</p></details> | 17 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Tree Search for Language Model Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01476v3)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous agents powered by language models (LMs) have demonstrated promise in their ability to perform decision-making tasks such as web automation. However, a key limitation remains: LMs, primarily optimized for natural language understanding and generation, struggle with multi-step reasoning, planning, and using environmental feedback when attempting to solve realistic computer tasks. Towards addressing this, we propose an inference-time search algorithm for LM agents to explicitly perform exploration and multi-step planning in interactive web environments. Our approach is a form of best-first tree search that operates within the actual environment space, and is complementary with most existing state-of-the-art agents. It is the first tree search algorithm for LM agents that shows effectiveness on realistic web tasks. On the challenging VisualWebArena benchmark, applying our search algorithm on top of a GPT-4o agent yields a 39.7% relative increase in success rate compared to the same baseline without search, setting a state-of-the-art success rate of 26.4%. On WebArena, search also yields a 28.0% relative improvement over a baseline agent, setting a competitive success rate of 19.2%. Our experiments highlight the effectiveness of search for web agents, and we demonstrate that performance scales with increased test-time compute. We conduct a thorough analysis of our results to highlight improvements from search, limitations, and promising directions for future work. Our code and models are publicly released at https://jykoh.com/search-agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages.

However, existing benchmarks lack practicality and scalability due to the extensive manual effort in defining task reward signals and implementing evaluation codes. We propose AutoEval, an evaluation framework which tests mobile agents without any manual effort. Our approach designs a UI state change representation which can be used to automatically generate task reward signals, and employs a Judge System for autonomous evaluation. Evaluation shows AutoEval can automatically generate reward signals with high correlation to human-annotated signals, and achieve high accuracy (up to 94%) in autonomous evaluation comparable to human evaluation. Finally, we evaluate state-of-the-art mobile agents using our framework, providing insights into their performance and limitations.</p></details> |  |
| **[When Your Boss Is an AI Bot: Exploring Opportunities and Risks of Manager Clone Agents in the Future Workplace](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10993v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Generative AI (GenAI) becomes increasingly embedded in the workplace, managers are beginning to create Manager Clone Agents - AI-powered digital surrogates that are trained on their work communications and decision patterns to perform managerial tasks on their behalf. To investigate this emerging phenomenon, we conducted six design fiction workshops (n = 23) with managers and workers, in which participants co-created speculative scenarios and discussed how Manager Clone Agents might transform collaborative work. We identified four potential roles that participants envisioned for Manager Clone Agents: proxy presence, informational conveyor belt, productivity engine, and leadership amplifier, while highlighting concerns spanning individual, interpersonal, and organizational levels. We provide design recommendations envisioned by both parties for integrating Manager Clone Agents responsibly into the future workplace, emphasizing the need to prioritize workers' perspectives, strengthen interpersonal bonds, and enable flexible clone configuration.</p></details> | 18 pages, 2 figures |
| **[PromptSculptor: Multi-Agent Based Text-to-Image Prompt Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12446v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of generative AI has democratized access to powerful tools such as Text-to-Image models. However, to generate high-quality images, users must still craft detailed prompts specifying scene, style, and context-often through multiple rounds of refinement. We propose PromptSculptor, a novel multi-agent framework that automates this iterative prompt optimization process. Our system decomposes the task into four specialized agents that work collaboratively to transform a short, vague user prompt into a comprehensive, refined prompt. By leveraging Chain-of-Thought reasoning, our framework effectively infers hidden context and enriches scene and background details. To iteratively refine the prompt, a self-evaluation agent aligns the modified prompt with the original input, while a feedback-tuning agent incorporates user feedback for further refinement. Experimental results demonstrate that PromptSculptor significantly enhances output quality and reduces the number of iterations needed for user satisfaction. Moreover, its model-agnostic design allows seamless integration with various T2I models, paving the way for industrial applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2025 System Demonstration Track</p></details> |
| **[UserRL: Training Interactive User-Centric Agent via Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19736v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in training agentic models that move beyond static benchmarks to engage in dynamic, multi-turn interactions. Yet, the ultimate value of such agents lies in their ability to assist users, a setting where diversity and dynamics of user interaction pose challenges. In this work, we propose UserRL, a unified framework for training and evaluating user-centric abilities through standardized gym environments paired with simulated users. We systematically vary turn-level reward assignment and trajectory-level score calculation to analyze how different formulations affect learning under the GRPO algorithm. Our experiments across Qwen3 models reveal three key findings: (i) SFT cold start is critical for unlocking initial interaction ability and enabling sustained RL improvements; (ii) deliberate trajectory scoring yields more efficient and effective multi-turn interactions; and (iii) while stronger simulated users (e.g., GPT-4o) facilitates training, open-source simulators (e.g., Qwen3-32B) remain a cost-effective and transferable option. Together, these results highlight that careful design of reward shaping and user simulation choice is as crucial as model scale, and establish UserRL as a practical pathway for developing robust user-centric agentic models. All codes and data are public for future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 Pa...</summary><p>28 Pages, 15 Figures, 6 Tables; Built upon latest UserBench release: arXiv:2507.22034</p></details> |
| **[Augmenting Multi-Agent Communication with State Delta Trajectory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19209v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent techniques such as role playing or multi-turn debates have been shown to be effective in improving the performance of large language models (LLMs) in downstream tasks. Despite their differences in workflows, existing multi-agent systems constructed from a single base LLM mostly use natural language for agent communication. While this is appealing for its simplicity and interpretability, it also introduces inevitable information loss as one model must down sample its continuous state vectors to discrete tokens before transferring them to the other model. Such losses are particularly significant when the information to transfer is not simple facts, but reasoning logics or abstractive thoughts. To tackle this problem, we propose a new communication protocol that transfers both natural language tokens and token-wise state transition trajectory from one agent to another. Particularly, compared to the actual state value, we find that the sequence of state changes in LLMs after generating each token can better reflect the information hidden behind the inference process. We propose a State Delta Encoding (SDE) method to represent state transition trajectories. The experimental results show that multi-agent systems with SDE achieve SOTA performance compared to other communication protocols, particularly in tasks that involve complex reasoning.</p></details> | 22 pages, 5 figures |
| **[MAPEX: A Multi-Agent Pipeline for Keyphrase Extraction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18813v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Keyphrase extraction is a fundamental task in natural language processing. However, existing unsupervised prompt-based methods for Large Language Models (LLMs) often rely on single-stage inference pipelines with uniform prompting, regardless of document length or LLM backbone. Such one-size-fits-all designs hinder the full exploitation of LLMs' reasoning and generation capabilities, especially given the complexity of keyphrase extraction across diverse scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose MAPEX, the first framework that introduces multi-agent collaboration into keyphrase extraction. MAPEX coordinates LLM-based agents through modules for expert recruitment, candidate extraction, topic guidance, knowledge augmentation, and post-processing. A dual-path strategy dynamically adapts to document length: knowledge-driven extraction for short texts and topic-guided extraction for long texts. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets across three different LLMs demonstrate its strong generalization and universality, outperforming the state-of-the-art unsupervised method by 2.44% and standard LLM baselines by 4.01% in F1@5 on average. Code is available at https://github.com/NKU-LITI/MAPEX.</p></details> |  |
| **[Online Process Reward Leanring for Agentic Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19199v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained with reinforcement learning (RL) as autonomous agents that reason and act over long horizons in interactive environments. However, sparse and sometimes unverifiable rewards make temporal credit assignment extremely challenging. Recent work attempts to integrate process supervision into agent learning but suffers from biased annotation, reward hacking, high-variance from overly fine-grained signals or failtures when state overlap is rare. We therefore introduce Online Process Reward Learning (OPRL), a general credit-assignment strategy for agentic RL that integrates seamlessly with standard on-policy algorithms without relying on additional rollouts or explicit step labels. In OPRL, we optimize an implicit process reward model (PRM) alternately with the agent's policy to transform trajectory preferences into implicit step rewards through a trajectory-based DPO objective. These step rewards are then used to compute step-level advantages, which are combined with episode-level advantages from outcome rewards for policy update, creating a self-reinforcing loop. Theoretical findings guarantee that the learned step rewards are consistent with trajectory preferences and act as potential-based shaping rewards, providing bounded gradients to stabilize training. Empirically, we evaluate OPRL on three distinct agent benmarks, including WebShop and VisualSokoban, as well as open-ended social interactions with unverfiable rewards in SOTOPIA. Crucially, OPRL shows superior performance over frontier LLMs and strong RL baselines across domains, achieving state-of-the-art results with higher sample-efficiency and lower variance during training. Further analysis also demonstrates the efficient exploration by OPRL using fewer actions, underscoring its potential for agentic learning in real-world scenarios.</p></details> | 16 pages, 5 figures |
| **[AURA: Autonomous Upskilling with Retrieval-Augmented Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02507v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Designing reinforcement learning curricula for agile robots traditionally requires extensive manual tuning of reward functions, environment randomizations, and training configurations. We introduce AURA (Autonomous Upskilling with Retrieval-Augmented Agents), a schema-validated curriculum reinforcement learning (RL) framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) as autonomous designers of multi-stage curricula. AURA transforms user prompts into YAML workflows that encode full reward functions, domain randomization strategies, and training configurations. All files are statically validated before any GPU time is used, ensuring efficient and reliable execution. A retrieval-augmented feedback loop allows specialized LLM agents to design, execute, and refine curriculum stages based on prior training results stored in a vector database, enabling continual improvement over time. Quantitative experiments show that AURA consistently outperforms LLM-guided baselines in generation success rate, humanoid locomotion, and manipulation tasks. Ablation studies highlight the importance of schema validation and retrieval for curriculum quality. AURA successfully trains end-to-end policies directly from user prompts and deploys them zero-shot on a custom humanoid robot in multiple environments - capabilities that did not exist previously with manually designed controllers. By abstracting the complexity of curriculum design, AURA enables scalable and adaptive policy learning pipelines that would be complex to construct by hand.</p></details> |  |
| **[AutoSpec: An Agentic Framework for Automatically Drafting Patent Specification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19640v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Patents play a critical role in driving technological innovation by granting inventors exclusive rights to their inventions. However the process of drafting a patent application is often expensive and time-consuming, making it a prime candidate for automation. Despite recent advancements in language models, several challenges hinder the development of robust automated patent drafting systems. First, the information within a patent application is highly confidential, which often prevents the use of closed-source LLMs for automating this task. Second, the process of drafting a patent application is difficult for even the most advanced language models due to their long context, technical writing style, and specialized domain knowledge. To address these challenges, we introduce AutoSpec, a secure, agentic framework for Automatically drafting patent Specification. Our approach decomposes the drafting process into a sequence of manageable subtasks, each solvable by smaller, open-source language models enhanced with custom tools tailored for drafting patent specification. To assess our system, we design a novel evaluation protocol in collaboration with experienced patent attorneys. Our automatic and expert evaluations show that AutoSpec outperforms existing baselines on a patent drafting task.</p></details> | EMNLP Findings 2025 |
| **[Knowledge Base-Aware Orchestration: A Dynamic, Privacy-Preserving Method for Multi-Agent Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19599v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent systems (MAS) are increasingly tasked with solving complex, knowledge-intensive problems where effective agent orchestration is critical. Conventional orchestration methods rely on static agent descriptions, which often become outdated or incomplete. This limitation leads to inefficient task routing, particularly in dynamic environments where agent capabilities continuously evolve. We introduce Knowledge Base-Aware (KBA) Orchestration, a novel approach that augments static descriptions with dynamic, privacy-preserving relevance signals derived from each agent's internal knowledge base (KB). In the proposed framework, when static descriptions are insufficient for a clear routing decision, the orchestrator prompts the subagents in parallel. Each agent then assesses the task's relevance against its private KB, returning a lightweight ACK signal without exposing the underlying data. These collected signals populate a shared semantic cache, providing dynamic indicators of agent suitability for future queries. By combining this novel mechanism with static descriptions, our method achieves more accurate and adaptive task routing preserving agent autonomy and data confidentiality. Benchmarks show that our KBA Orchestration significantly outperforms static description-driven methods in routing precision and overall system efficiency, making it suitable for large-scale systems that require higher accuracy than standard description-driven routing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Agentic Scene Policies: Unifying Space, Semantics, and Affordances for Robot Action](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19571v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Executing open-ended natural language queries is a core problem in robotics. While recent advances in imitation learning and vision-language-actions models (VLAs) have enabled promising end-to-end policies, these models struggle when faced with complex instructions and new scenes. An alternative is to design an explicit scene representation as a queryable interface between the robot and the world, using query results to guide downstream motion planning. In this work, we present Agentic Scene Policies (ASP), an agentic framework that leverages the advanced semantic, spatial, and affordance-based querying capabilities of modern scene representations to implement a capable language-conditioned robot policy. ASP can execute open-vocabulary queries in a zero-shot manner by explicitly reasoning about object affordances in the case of more complex skills. Through extensive experiments, we compare ASP with VLAs on tabletop manipulation problems and showcase how ASP can tackle room-level queries through affordance-guided navigation, and a scaled-up scene representation.

The Nano Bio-Agent (NBA) framework we implemented incorporates task decomposition, tool orchestration, and API access into well-established systems such as NCBI and AlphaGenome. Results show that SLMs combined with such agentic framework can achieve comparable and in many cases superior performance versus existing approaches utilising larger models, with our best model-agent combination achieving 98% accuracy on the GeneTuring benchmark. Notably, small 3-10B parameter models consistently achieve 85-97% accuracy while requiring much lower computational resources than conventional approaches. This demonstrates promising potential for efficiency gains, cost savings, and democratization of ML-powered genomics tools while retaining highly robust and accurate performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Heterogeneous Multi-Agent Challenge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19512v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is a growing research area which gained significant traction in recent years, extending Deep RL applications to a much wider range of problems. A particularly challenging class of problems in this domain is Heterogeneous Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (HeMARL), where agents with different sensors, resources, or capabilities must cooperate based on local information. The large number of real-world situations involving heterogeneous agents makes it an attractive research area, yet underexplored, as most MARL research focuses on homogeneous agents (e.g., a swarm of identical robots). In MARL and single-agent RL, standardized environments such as ALE and SMAC have allowed to establish recognized benchmarks to measure progress. However, there is a clear lack of such standardized testbed for cooperative HeMARL. As a result, new research in this field often uses simple environments, where most algorithms perform near optimally, or uses weakly heterogeneous MARL environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages.

We present MVVM, a WebAssembly-based secure container framework that enables transparent live migration of LLM agent workspaces between edge devices and cloud servers with end-to-end privacy guarantees, resilient multi-tier replication, speculative execution for latency optimization, and integrated validation for safety assurance. MVVM introduces two key innovations: (1) a two-way sandboxing framework leveraging hardware enclaves and accelerator extensions that protects both the agent from malicious hosts and the host from compromised agents; (2) an efficient cross platform migration mechanism using WebAssembly and WASI's platform-agnostic design, enabling seamless movement across ARM phones, RISC-V MCUs, x86 servers, and heterogeneous accelerators; and three astonishing use cases: (1) privacy-aware daemon that automatically determines whether to execute locally or remotely based on data sensitivity and resource availability; (2) multi-tier replication with intelligent quality degradation that maintains service availability despite network failures or resource constraints; (3) a comprehensive execution framework combining speculative execution for 10x latency reduction with parallel validation that ensures output safety without compromising responsiveness. Our evaluation demonstrates that MVVM is validated on three separate devices across 18 workloads.</p></details> |  |

However, existing MAS initialization methods do not fully account for the collaborative needs of the generated agents in subsequent stages. Inspired by the principles of effective team composition, we propose AgentInit, which aims to optimize the structure of agent teams. Specifically, in addition to multi-round interactions and reflections between agents during agent generation, AgentInit incorporates a Natural Language to Format mechanism to ensure consistency and standardization. Balanced team selection strategies using Pareto principles are subsequently applied to jointly consider agent team diversity and task relevance to promote effective and efficient collaboration and enhance overall system performance. Experiments show that AgentInit consistently outperforms state-of-the-art initialization methods and pre-defined strategies across various frameworks and tasks, achieving an overall performance improvement of up to 1.2 and 1.6, respectively, while also significantly reducing token consumption. Further analysis confirms its strong transferability to similar tasks and verifies the effectiveness of its key components, demonstrating its capability and adaptability as a reliable MAS initialization method. Source code and models are available at https://github.com/1737423697/AgentInit.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 Findings |

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have opened the possibility of the direct execution of NL test cases by LLM agents. This paper investigates this direction, focusing on the impact on NL test case unsoundness and on test case execution consistency. NL test cases are inherently unsound, as they may yield false failures due to ambiguous instructions or unpredictable agent behaviour. Furthermore, repeated executions of the same NL test case may lead to inconsistent outcomes, undermining test reliability. To address these challenges, we propose an algorithm for executing NL test cases with guardrail mechanisms and specialised agents that dynamically verify the correct execution of each test step. We introduce measures to evaluate the capabilities of LLMs in test execution and one measure to quantify execution consistency. We propose a definition of weak unsoundness to characterise contexts in which NL test case execution remains acceptable, with respect to the industrial quality levels Six Sigma. Our experimental evaluation with eight publicly available LLMs, ranging from 3B to 70B parameters, demonstrates both the potential and current limitations of current LLM agents for GUI testing. Our experiments show that Meta Llama 3.1 70B demonstrates acceptable capabilities in NL test case execution with high execution consistency (above the level 3-sigma). We provide prototype tools, test suites, and results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Abduct, Act, Predict: Scaffolding Causal Inference for Automated Failure Attribution in Multi-Agent Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10401v2)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Failure attribution in multi-agent systems -- pinpointing the exact step where a decisive error occurs -- is a critical yet unsolved challenge. Current methods treat this as a pattern recognition task over long conversation logs, leading to critically low step-level accuracy (below 17\%), which renders them impractical for debugging complex systems. Their core weakness is a fundamental inability to perform robust counterfactual reasoning: to determine if correcting a single action would have actually averted the task failure. To bridge this \emph{counterfactual inference gap}, we introduce Abduct-Act-Predict (A2P) Scaffolding, a novel agent framework that transforms failure attribution from pattern recognition into a structured causal inference task. A2P explicitly guides a large language model through a formal three-step reasoning process within a single inference pass: (1) Abduction, to infer the hidden root causes behind an agent's actions; (2) Action, to define a minimal corrective intervention; and (3) Prediction, to simulate the subsequent trajectory and verify if the intervention resolves the failure. This structured approach leverages the holistic context of the entire conversation while imposing a rigorous causal logic on the model's analysis. Our extensive experiments on the Who\&When benchmark demonstrate its efficacy. On the Algorithm-Generated dataset, A2P achieves 47.46\% step-level accuracy, a 2.85$\times$ improvement over the 16.67\% of the baseline. On the more complex Hand-Crafted dataset, it achieves 29.31\% step accuracy, a 2.43$\times$ improvement over the baseline's 12.07\%. By reframing the problem through a causal lens, A2P Scaffolding provides a robust, verifiable, and significantly more accurate solution for automated failure attribution. Ours code are released at https://github.com/ResearAI/A2P.</p></details> |  |
| **[EvoAgentX: An Automated Framework for Evolving Agentic Workflows](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03616v2)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent systems (MAS) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for orchestrating large language models (LLMs) and specialized tools to collaboratively address complex tasks. However, existing MAS frameworks often require manual workflow configuration and lack native support for dynamic evolution and performance optimization. In addition, many MAS optimization algorithms are not integrated into a unified framework. In this paper, we present EvoAgentX, an open-source platform that automates the generation, execution, and evolutionary optimization of multi-agent workflows. EvoAgentX employs a modular architecture consisting of five core layers: the basic components, agent, workflow, evolving, and evaluation layers. Specifically, within the evolving layer, EvoAgentX integrates three MAS optimization algorithms, TextGrad, AFlow, and MIPRO, to iteratively refine agent prompts, tool configurations, and workflow topologies. We evaluate EvoAgentX on HotPotQA, MBPP, and MATH for multi-hop reasoning, code generation, and mathematical problem solving, respectively, and further assess it on real-world tasks using GAIA. Experimental results show that EvoAgentX consistently achieves significant performance improvements, including a 7.44% increase in HotPotQA F1, a 10.00% improvement in MBPP pass@1, a 10.00% gain in MATH solve accuracy, and an overall accuracy improvement of up to 20.00% on GAIA.

| **[Simulating Online Social Media Conversations on Controversial Topics Using AI Agents Calibrated on Real-World Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18985v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Online social networks offer a valuable lens to analyze both individual and collective phenomena. Researchers often use simulators to explore controlled scenarios, and the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) makes these simulations more realistic by enabling agents to understand and generate natural language content. In this work, we investigate the behavior of LLM-based agents in a simulated microblogging social network. We initialize agents with realistic profiles calibrated on real-world online conversations from the 2022 Italian political election and extend an existing simulator by introducing mechanisms for opinion modeling. We examine how LLM agents simulate online conversations, interact with others, and evolve their opinions under different scenarios. Our results show that LLM agents generate coherent content, form connections, and build a realistic social network structure. However, their generated content displays less heterogeneity in tone and toxicity compared to real data. We also find that LLM-based opinion dynamics evolve over time in ways similar to traditional mathematical models. Varying parameter configurations produces no significant changes, indicating that simulations require more careful cognitive modeling at initialization to replicate human behavior more faithfully. Overall, we demonstrate the potential of LLMs for simulating user behavior in social environments, while also identifying key challenges in capturing heterogeneity and complex dynamics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Difficulty-Aware Agent Orchestration in LLM-Powered Workflows](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11079v2)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM)-based agentic systems have shown strong capabilities across various tasks. However, existing multi-agent frameworks often rely on static or task-level workflows, which either over-process simple queries or underperform on complex ones, while also neglecting the efficiency-performance trade-offs across heterogeneous LLMs. To address these limitations, we propose Difficulty-Aware Agentic Orchestration (DAAO), a dynamic framework that adapts workflow depth, operator selection, and LLM assignment based on the difficulty of each input query. DAAO comprises three interdependent modules: a variational autoencoder (VAE) for difficulty estimation, a modular operator allocator, and a cost- and performance-aware LLM router. By leveraging heterogeneous LLMs and dynamically tailoring workflows, DAAO enables fine-grained, query-specific reasoning strategies. DAAO outperforms prior multi-agent systems in both accuracy and inference efficiency across six benchmarks. We will release our code and implementation details upon publication.</p></details> |  |

Comprehensive and in-depth analyses of these data are critical for hypothesis validation, anomaly detection, reproducibility, and impactful findings. Although workflow provenance techniques support such analyses, at large scale, the provenance data become complex and difficult to analyze. Existing systems depend on custom scripts, structured queries, or static dashboards, limiting data interaction. In this work, we introduce an evaluation methodology, reference architecture, and open-source implementation that leverages interactive Large Language Model (LLM) agents for runtime data analysis. Our approach uses a lightweight, metadata-driven design that translates natural language into structured provenance queries. Evaluations across LLaMA, GPT, Gemini, and Claude, covering diverse query classes and a real-world chemistry workflow, show that modular design, prompt tuning, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enable accurate and insightful LLM agent responses beyond recorded provenance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted in the proceedings of the Supercomputing Conference (SC).

| **[LLM-based Agents Suffer from Hallucinations: A Survey of Taxonomy, Methods, and Directions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18970v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Driven by the rapid advancements of Large Language Models (LLMs), LLM-based agents have emerged as powerful intelligent systems capable of human-like cognition, reasoning, and interaction. These agents are increasingly being deployed across diverse real-world applications, including student education, scientific research, and financial analysis. However, despite their remarkable potential, LLM-based agents remain vulnerable to hallucination issues, which can result in erroneous task execution and undermine the reliability of the overall system design. Addressing this critical challenge requires a deep understanding and a systematic consolidation of recent advances on LLM-based agents. To this end, we present the first comprehensive survey of hallucinations in LLM-based agents. By carefully analyzing the complete workflow of agents, we propose a new taxonomy that identifies different types of agent hallucinations occurring at different stages. Furthermore, we conduct an in-depth examination of eighteen triggering causes underlying the emergence of agent hallucinations. Through a detailed review of a large number of existing studies, we summarize approaches for hallucination mitigation and detection, and highlight promising directions for future research. We hope this survey will inspire further efforts toward addressing hallucinations in LLM-based agents, ultimately contributing to the development of more robust and reliable agent systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Attack for Defense: Adversarial Agents for Point Prompt Optimization Empowering Segment Anything Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18891v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompt quality plays a critical role in the performance of the Segment Anything Model (SAM), yet existing approaches often rely on heuristic or manually crafted prompts, limiting scalability and generalization. In this paper, we propose Point Prompt Defender, an adversarial reinforcement learning framework that adopts an attack-for-defense paradigm to automatically optimize point prompts. We construct a task-agnostic point prompt environment by representing image patches as nodes in a dual-space graph, where edges encode both physical and semantic distances. Within this environment, an attacker agent learns to activate a subset of prompts that maximally degrade SAM's segmentation performance, while a defender agent learns to suppress these disruptive prompts and restore accuracy. Both agents are trained using Deep Q-Networks with a reward signal based on segmentation quality variation. During inference, only the defender is deployed to refine arbitrary coarse prompt sets, enabling enhanced SAM segmentation performance across diverse tasks without retraining. Extensive experiments show that Point Prompt Defender effectively improves SAM's robustness and generalization, establishing a flexible, interpretable, and plug-and-play framework for prompt-based segmentation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Failure Makes the Agent Stronger: Enhancing Accuracy through Structured Reflection for Reliable Tool Interactions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18847v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tool-augmented large language models (LLMs) are usually trained with supervised imitation or coarse-grained reinforcement learning that optimizes single tool calls. Current self-reflection practices rely on heuristic prompts or one-way reasoning: the model is urged to 'think more' instead of learning error diagnosis and repair. This is fragile in multi-turn interactions; after a failure the model often repeats the same mistake. We propose structured reflection, which turns the path from error to repair into an explicit, controllable, and trainable action. The agent produces a short yet precise reflection: it diagnoses the failure using evidence from the previous step and then proposes a correct, executable follow-up call. For training we combine DAPO and GSPO objectives with a reward scheme tailored to tool use, optimizing the stepwise strategy Reflect, then Call, then Final. To evaluate, we introduce Tool-Reflection-Bench, a lightweight benchmark that programmatically checks structural validity, executability, parameter correctness, and result consistency. Tasks are built as mini trajectories of erroneous call, reflection, and corrected call, with disjoint train and test splits. Experiments on BFCL v3 and Tool-Reflection-Bench show large gains in multi-turn tool-call success and error recovery, and a reduction of redundant calls. These results indicate that making reflection explicit and optimizing it directly improves the reliability of tool interaction and offers a reproducible path for agents to learn from failure.</p></details> | 9pages |
| **[A Multi-Agent Framework with Automated Decision Rule Optimization for Cross-Domain Misinformation Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23329v2)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Misinformation spans various domains, but detection methods trained on specific domains often perform poorly when applied to others. With the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs), researchers have begun to utilize LLMs for cross-domain misinformation detection. However, existing LLM-based methods often fail to adequately analyze news in the target domain, limiting their detection capabilities. More importantly, these methods typically rely on manually designed decision rules, which are limited by domain knowledge and expert experience, thus limiting the generalizability of decision rules to different domains. To address these issues, we propose a MultiAgent Framework for cross-domain misinformation detection with Automated Decision Rule Optimization (MARO). Under this framework, we first employs multiple expert agents to analyze target-domain news. Subsequently, we introduce a question-reflection mechanism that guides expert agents to facilitate higherquality analysis. Furthermore, we propose a decision rule optimization approach based on carefully-designed cross-domain validation tasks to iteratively enhance the effectiveness of decision rules in different domains. Experimental results and in-depth analysis on commonlyused datasets demonstrate that MARO achieves significant improvements over existing methods.</p></details> |  |

It leverages content-addressed storage, hierarchical taxonomies, and cryptographic signing to enable efficient, verifiable, and multi-dimensional discovery across heterogeneous Multi-Agent Systems (MAS). Built on the Open Agentic Schema Framework (OASF), ADS decouples capability indexing from content location through a two-level mapping realized over a Kademlia-based Distributed Hash Table (DHT). It reuses mature OCI / ORAS infrastructure for artifact distribution, integrates Sigstore for provenance, and supports schema-driven extensibility for emerging agent modalities (LLM prompt agents, MCP servers, A2A-enabled components). This paper formalizes the architectural model, describes storage and discovery layers, explains security and performance properties, and positions ADS within the broader landscape of emerging agent registry and interoperability initiatives.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-scale Temporal Prediction via Incremental Generation and Multi-agent Collaboration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17429v2)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate temporal prediction is the bridge between comprehensive scene understanding and embodied artificial intelligence. However, predicting multiple fine-grained states of a scene at multiple temporal scales is difficult for vision-language models. We formalize the Multi-Scale Temporal Prediction (MSTP) task in general and surgical scenes by decomposing multi-scale into two orthogonal dimensions: the temporal scale, forecasting states of humans and surgery at varying look-ahead intervals, and the state scale, modeling a hierarchy of states in general and surgical scenes. For example, in general scenes, states of contact relationships are finer-grained than states of spatial relationships. In surgical scenes, medium-level steps are finer-grained than high-level phases yet remain constrained by their encompassing phase. To support this unified task, we introduce the first MSTP Benchmark, featuring synchronized annotations across multiple state scales and temporal scales. We further propose a method, Incremental Generation and Multi-agent Collaboration (IG-MC), which integrates two key innovations. First, we present a plug-and-play incremental generation module that continuously synthesizes up-to-date visual previews at expanding temporal scales to inform multiple decision-making agents, keeping decisions and generated visuals synchronized and preventing performance degradation as look-ahead intervals lengthen. Second, we present a decision-driven multi-agent collaboration framework for multi-state prediction, comprising generation, initiation, and multi-state assessment agents that dynamically trigger and evaluate prediction cycles to balance global coherence and local fidelity.</p></details> | 20 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Autonomous Data Agents: A New Opportunity for Smart Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18710v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As data continues to grow in scale and complexity, preparing, transforming, and analyzing it remains labor-intensive, repetitive, and difficult to scale. Since data contains knowledge and AI learns knowledge from it, the alignment between AI and data is essential. However, data is often not structured in ways that are optimal for AI utilization. Moreover, an important question arises: how much knowledge can we pack into data through intensive data operations? Autonomous data agents (DataAgents), which integrate LLM reasoning with task decomposition, action reasoning and grounding, and tool calling, can autonomously interpret data task descriptions, decompose tasks into subtasks, reason over actions, ground actions into python code or tool calling, and execute operations. Unlike traditional data management and engineering tools, DataAgents dynamically plan workflows, call powerful tools, and adapt to diverse data tasks at scale. This report argues that DataAgents represent a paradigm shift toward autonomous data-to-knowledge systems. DataAgents are capable of handling collection, integration, preprocessing, selection, transformation, reweighing, augmentation, reprogramming, repairs, and retrieval. Through these capabilities, DataAgents transform complex and unstructured data into coherent and actionable knowledge. We first examine why the convergence of agentic AI and data-to-knowledge systems has emerged as a critical trend. We then define the concept of DataAgents and discuss their architectural design, training strategies, as well as the new skills and capabilities they enable. Finally, we call for concerted efforts to advance action workflow optimization, establish open datasets and benchmark ecosystems, safeguard privacy, balance efficiency with scalability, and develop trustworthy DataAgent guardrails to prevent malicious actions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Global Convergence of Multi-Agent Policy Gradient in Markov Potential Games](http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.01969v4)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Potential games are arguably one of the most important and widely studied classes of normal form games. They define the archetypal setting of multi-agent coordination as all agent utilities are perfectly aligned with each other via a common potential function. Can this intuitive framework be transplanted in the setting of Markov Games? What are the similarities and differences between multi-agent coordination with and without state dependence? We present a novel definition of Markov Potential Games (MPG) that generalizes prior attempts at capturing complex stateful multi-agent coordination. Counter-intuitively, insights from normal-form potential games do not carry over as MPGs can consist of settings where state-games can be zero-sum games. In the opposite direction, Markov games where every state-game is a potential game are not necessarily MPGs. Nevertheless, MPGs showcase standard desirable properties such as the existence of deterministic Nash policies. In our main technical result, we prove fast convergence of independent policy gradient to Nash policies by adapting recent gradient dominance property arguments developed for single agent MDPs to multi-agent learning settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>New v...</summary><p>New version fixes typos in the proof of main theorem and improves the number of iterations to 1/\epsilon^5 by improving Lemma D.3.

We present \textbf{Agentic AutoSurvey}, a multi-agent framework for automated survey generation that addresses fundamental limitations in existing approaches. Our system employs four specialized agents (Paper Search Specialist, Topic Mining \& Clustering, Academic Survey Writer, and Quality Evaluator) working in concert to generate comprehensive literature surveys with superior synthesis quality. Through experiments on six representative LLM research topics from COLM 2024 categories, we demonstrate that our multi-agent approach achieves significant improvements over existing baselines, scoring 8.18/10 compared to AutoSurvey's 4.77/10. The multi-agent architecture processes 75--443 papers per topic (847 total across six topics) while targeting high citation coverage (often $\geq$80\% on 75--100-paper sets; lower on very large sets such as RLHF) through specialized agent orchestration. Our 12-dimension evaluation captures organization, synthesis integration, and critical analysis beyond basic metrics. These findings demonstrate that multi-agent architectures represent a meaningful advancement for automated literature survey generation in rapidly evolving scientific domains.</p></details> | 29 pages, 7 figures |
| **[LogicGuard: Improving Embodied LLM agents through Temporal Logic based Critics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03293v2)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in zero-shot and single step reasoning and decision making problems, but in long horizon sequential planning tasks, their errors compound, often leading to unreliable or inefficient behavior. We introduce LogicGuard, a modular actor-critic architecture in which an LLM actor is guided by a trajectory level LLM critic that communicates through Linear Temporal Logic (LTL). Our setup combines the reasoning strengths of language models with the guarantees of formal logic. The actor selects high-level actions from natural language observations, while the critic analyzes full trajectories and proposes new LTL constraints that shield the actor from future unsafe or inefficient behavior. LogicGuard supports both fixed safety rules and adaptive, learned constraints, and is model-agnostic: any LLM-based planner can serve as the actor, with LogicGuard acting as a logic-generating wrapper. We formalize planning as graph traversal under symbolic constraints, allowing LogicGuard to analyze failed or suboptimal trajectories and generate new temporal logic rules that improve future behavior. To demonstrate generality, we evaluate LogicGuard across two distinct settings: short-horizon general tasks and long-horizon specialist tasks. On the Behavior benchmark of 100 household tasks, LogicGuard increases task completion rates by 25% over a baseline InnerMonologue planner. On the Minecraft diamond-mining task, which is long-horizon and requires multiple interdependent subgoals, LogicGuard improves both efficiency and safety compared to SayCan and InnerMonologue. These results show that enabling LLMs to supervise each other through temporal logic yields more reliable, efficient and safe decision-making for both embodied agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>Modif...</summary><p>Modified version of prior LTLCrit work with new robotics dataset</p></details> |

We present a novel geospatial agent-based model that integrates climate hazard data with evolutionary learning for economic agents. Our framework combines Mesa-based spatial modelling with CLIMADA climate impact assessment, introducing adaptive learning behaviours that allow firms to evolve strategies for budget allocation, pricing, wages, and risk adaptation through fitness-based selection and mutation. We demonstrate the framework using riverine flood projections under RCP8.5 until 2100, showing that evolutionary adaptation enables firms to converge with baseline (no hazard) production levels after decades of disruption due to climate stress. Our results reveal systemic risks where even agents that are not directly exposed to floods face impacts through supply chain disruptions, with the end-of-century average price of goods 5.6% higher under RCP8.5 compared to the baseline. This open-source framework provides financial institutions and companies with tools to quantify both direct and cascading climate risks while evaluating cost-effective adaptation strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted and accepted to Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning workshop at NeurIPS 2025. 5 pages, 1 figure.

Yet, scalable and generalizable execution-grounded environments remain scarce, limiting progress in training more capable ML agents. We introduce CTF-Dojo, the first large-scale executable runtime tailored for training LLMs with verifiable feedback, featuring 658 fully functional Capture-The-Flag (CTF)-style challenges containerized in Docker with guaranteed reproducibility. To enable rapid scaling without manual intervention, we develop CTF-Forge, an automated pipeline that transforms publicly available artifacts into ready-to-use execution environments in minutes, eliminating weeks of expert configuration traditionally required. We trained LLM-based agents on just 486 high-quality, execution-verified trajectories from CTF-Dojo, achieving up to 11.6% absolute gains over strong baselines across three competitive benchmarks: InterCode-CTF, NYU CTF Bench, and Cybench. Our best-performing 32B model reaches 31.9% Pass@1, establishing a new open-weight state-of-the-art that rivals frontier models like DeepSeek-V3-0324 and Gemini-2.5-Flash. By framing CTF-style tasks as a benchmark for executable-agent learning, CTF-Dojo demonstrates that execution-grounded training signals are not only effective but pivotal in advancing high-performance ML agents without dependence on costly proprietary systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[XARP Tools: An Extended Reality Platform for Humans and AI Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04108v3)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial intelligence (AI) and extended reality (XR) are increasingly combined in applications such as motor skill training, personalized feedback, and embodied task guidance. Yet developing AI-XR systems remains challenging due to fragmented toolchains that push developers into ad hoc integrations, diverting their attention away from essential design concerns such as interactivity and context awareness. To address this issue, we present XARP (XR Agent-ready Remote Procedures), a toolkit for AI-XR development designed for both human developers and AI agents. XARP implements JSON-based remote procedure calls that allow server-side Python to control XR clients, providing a high-level abstraction over low-level integration details. Humans can use XARP as a Python library to write XR applications with reduced implementation overhead. AI agents operate with the same abstraction to dynamically call tools to generate XR applications at runtime in response to context changes and user requests. XARP offers Model Context Protocol (MCP) connectivity that allows third-party agents and tools to leverage XR capabilities, previously unavailable. We conducted three case studies that demonstrate XARP supports a variety of AI-XR applications, including AI-guided fencing, drone assistance, and room layout design. We evaluated XARP in a walkthrough study with 24 AI and XR developers. UTAUT scores indicate high potential for adoption, and participants reported that XARP can reduce authoring time, lower entry barriers for developers unfamiliar with AI or XR, and enable the implementation of novel AI-XR systems.</p></details> |  |

While large language models (LLMs) show promise in multi-step reasoning, purely text-based methods often struggle with the complex numerical computations and fine-grained operations inherently required in this task. Tool-integrated reasoning improves computational accuracy via explicit code execution, yet existing systems frequently rely on rigid patterns, supervised imitation, and lack true autonomous adaptability. In this paper, we present TableMind, an LLM-driven table reasoning agent that (i) autonomously performs multi-turn tool invocation, (ii) writes and executes data-analyzing code in a secure sandbox environment for data analysis and precise numerical reasoning, and (iii) exhibits high-level capabilities such as planning and self-reflection to adapt strategies. To realize these capabilities, we adopt a two-stage fine-tuning paradigm built on top of a powerful pre-trained language model: supervised fine-tuning on high-quality reasoning trajectories to establish effective tool usage patterns, followed by reinforcement fine-tuning to optimize multi-objective strategies. In particular, we propose Rank-Aware Policy Optimization (RAPO), which increases the update weight of high-quality trajectories when their output probabilities are lower than those of low-quality ones, thereby guiding the model more consistently toward better and more accurate answers. Extensive experiments on several mainstream benchmarks demonstrate that TableMind achieves superior performance compared to competitive baselines, yielding substantial gains in both reasoning accuracy and computational precision.</p></details> | <details><summary>Comme...</summary><p>Comments: 10 pages, 6 figures.

Unlike a typical software application residing in a Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), agentic LLMs consciously rely on nondeterministic behavior of the AI (only defining a final goal, leaving the path selection to LLM). This characteristic introduces substantial security risk to both operational security and information security. Most common existing defense mechanism rely on detection of malicious intent and preventing it from reaching the LLM agent, thus protecting against jailbreak attacks such as prompt injection. In this paper, we present an alternative approach, LLMZ+, which moves beyond traditional detection-based approaches by implementing prompt whitelisting. Through this method, only contextually appropriate and safe messages are permitted to interact with the agentic LLM. By leveraging the specificity of context, LLMZ+ guarantees that all exchanges between external users and the LLM conform to predefined use cases and operational boundaries. Our approach streamlines the security framework, enhances its long-term resilience, and reduces the resources required for sustaining LLM information security. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that LLMZ+ provides strong resilience against the most common jailbreak prompts. At the same time, legitimate business communications are not disrupted, and authorized traffic flows seamlessly between users and the agentic LLM. We measure the effectiveness of approach using false positive and false negative rates, both of which can be reduced to 0 in our experimental setting.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 5 figures, to be published and presented at ICMLA 2025</p></details> |

We focus on cross-sector partnerships (CSPs) involving public, private, and nonprofit organizations, each contributing distinct resources. Group formation occurs as agents strategically optimize their choices in response to others within a competitive setting. We prove the existence of stable group equilibria and simulate formation dynamics under varying spatial and resource conditions. The results show that limited individual resources lead to groups that form mainly among nearby actors, while abundant resources allow groups to move across larger distances. Increased resource heterogeneity and spatial proximity promote the formation of larger and more diverse groups. These findings reveal key trade-offs shaping group size and composition, guiding strategies for effective cross-sector collaborations and multi-agent systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted by the 61st Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing</p></details> |
| **[Accelerating Network Slice Placement with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18545v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cellular networks are increasingly realized through software-based entities, with core functions deployed as Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) on Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS) hardware. Network slicing has emerged as a key enabler of 5G by providing logically isolated Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees for diverse applications. With the adoption of cloud-native infrastructures, the placement of network slices across heterogeneous multi-cloud environments poses new challenges due to variable resource capabilities and slice-specific requirements. This paper introduces a modular framework for autonomous and near-optimal VNF placement based on a disaggregated Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) approach. The framework incorporates real traffic profiles to estimate slice resource demands and employs a MARL-based scheduler to minimize deployment cost while meeting QoS constraints. Experimental evaluation on a multi-cloud testbed shows a 19x speed-up compared to combinatorial optimization, with deployment costs within 7.8% of the optimal. While the method incurs up to 2.42x more QoS violations under high load, the trade-off provides significantly faster decision-making and reduced computational complexity. These results suggest that MARL-based approaches offer a scalable and cost-efficient solution for real-time network slice placement in heterogeneous infrastructures.</p></details> |  |

Yet most multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approaches focus on isolated stages - exploration, relay formation, or access - under static deployments and centralized control, limiting adaptability. We propose the AI Agent Access (A\^3) Network, a unified, embodied intelligence-driven framework that transforms multi-agent networking into a dynamic, decentralized, and end-to-end system. Unlike prior schemes, the A\^3 Network integrates exploration, target user access, and backhaul maintenance within a single learning process, while supporting on-demand agent addition during runtime. Its decentralized policies ensure that even a single agent can operate independently with limited observations, while coordinated agents achieve scalable, communication-optimized coverage. By embedding link-level communication metrics into actor-critic learning, the A\^3 Network couples topology formation with robust decision-making. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the A\^3 Network not only balances exploration and communication efficiency but also delivers system-level adaptability absent in existing MARL frameworks, offering a new paradigm for 6G multi-agent networks.</p></details> |  |

These characteristics make it particularly well-suited for agent-based approaches that can automate knowledge exploration, manage complex workflows, and generate clinically meaningful outputs. Recent progress in large language model (LLM)-based agents has demonstrated promising capabilities in literature synthesis, data analysis, and even end-to-end research execution. However, existing systems remain limited for health informatics because they lack mechanisms to interpret medical visualizations and often overlook domain-specific quality requirements. To address these gaps, we introduce OpenLens AI, a fully automated framework tailored to health informatics. OpenLens AI integrates specialized agents for literature review, data analysis, code generation, and manuscript preparation, enhanced by vision-language feedback for medical visualization and quality control for reproducibility. The framework automates the entire research pipeline, producing publication-ready LaTeX manuscripts with transparent and traceable workflows, thereby offering a domain-adapted solution for advancing health informatics research.</p></details> |  |

To harness these new capabilities while ensuring trustworthiness, we must recognize a fundamental duality within the SE field in the Agentic SE era, comprising two symbiotic modalities: SE for Humans and SE for Agents. This duality demands a radical reimagining of the foundational pillars of SE (actors, processes, tools, and artifacts) which manifest differently across each modality. We propose two purpose-built workbenches to support this vision. The Agent Command Environment (ACE) serves as a command center where humans orchestrate and mentor agent teams, handling outputs such as Merge-Readiness Packs (MRPs) and Consultation Request Packs (CRPs). The Agent Execution Environment (AEE) is a digital workspace where agents perform tasks while invoking human expertise when facing ambiguity or complex trade-offs. This bi-directional partnership, which supports agent-initiated human callbacks and handovers, gives rise to new, structured engineering activities (i.e., processes) that redefine human-AI collaboration, elevating the practice from agentic coding to true agentic software engineering. This paper presents the Structured Agentic Software Engineering (SASE) vision, outlining several of the foundational pillars for the future of SE. The paper culminates in a research roadmap that identifies a few key challenges and opportunities while briefly discussing the resulting impact of this future on SE education. Our goal is not to offer a definitive solution, but to provide a conceptual scaffold with structured vocabulary to catalyze a community-wide dialogue, pushing the SE community to think beyond its classic, human-centric tenets toward a disciplined, scalable, and trustworthy agentic future.</p></details> |  |

We extend the A2A paradigm [1 , 2] by introducing a cryptographically grounded mechanism for lineage verification, wherein the provenance and evolution of NHIs are anchored in append-only Merkle tree structures modeled after Certificate Transparency (CT) logs. Unlike traditional A2A models that primarily secure point-to-point interactions, our approach enables both agents and external verifiers to cryptographically validate multi-hop provenance, thereby ensuring the integrity of the entire call chain. A federated proof server acts as an auditor across one or more Merkle logs, aggregating inclusion proofs and consistency checks into compact, signed attestations that external parties can verify without access to the full execution trace. In parallel, we augment the A2A agent card to incorporate explicit identity verification primitives, enabling both peer agents and human approvers to authenticate the legitimacy of NHI representations in a standardized manner. Together, these contributions establish a cohesive model that integrates identity attestation, lineage verification, and independent proof auditing, thereby advancing the security posture of inter-agent ecosystems and providing a foundation for robust governance of NHIs in regulated environments such as FedRAMP.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mind the Gap: Evaluating Model- and Agentic-Level Vulnerabilities in LLMs with Action Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04802v2)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models transition to agentic systems, current safety evaluation frameworks face critical gaps in assessing deployment-specific risks. We introduce AgentSeer, an observability-based evaluation framework that decomposes agentic executions into granular action and component graphs, enabling systematic agentic-situational assessment. Through cross-model validation on GPT-OSS-20B and Gemini-2.0-flash using HarmBench single turn and iterative refinement attacks, we demonstrate fundamental differences between model-level and agentic-level vulnerability profiles. Model-level evaluation reveals baseline differences: GPT-OSS-20B (39.47% ASR) versus Gemini-2.0-flash (50.00% ASR), with both models showing susceptibility to social engineering while maintaining logic-based attack resistance. However, agentic-level assessment exposes agent-specific risks invisible to traditional evaluation. We discover "agentic-only" vulnerabilities that emerge exclusively in agentic contexts, with tool-calling showing 24-60% higher ASR across both models. Cross-model analysis reveals universal agentic patterns, agent transfer operations as highest-risk tools, semantic rather than syntactic vulnerability mechanisms, and context-dependent attack effectiveness, alongside model-specific security profiles in absolute ASR levels and optimal injection strategies. Direct attack transfer from model-level to agentic contexts shows degraded performance (GPT-OSS-20B: 57% human injection ASR; Gemini-2.0-flash: 28%), while context-aware iterative attacks successfully compromise objectives that failed at model-level, confirming systematic evaluation gaps. These findings establish the urgent need for agentic-situation evaluation paradigms, with AgentSeer providing the standardized methodology and empirical validation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Policy Gradient with Self-Attention for Model-Free Distributed Nonlinear Multi-Agent Games](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18371v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent games in dynamic nonlinear settings are challenging due to the time-varying interactions among the agents and the non-stationarity of the (potential) Nash equilibria. In this paper we consider model-free games, where agent transitions and costs are observed without knowledge of the transition and cost functions that generate them. We propose a policy gradient approach to learn distributed policies that follow the communication structure in multi-team games, with multiple agents per team. Our formulation is inspired by the structure of distributed policies in linear quadratic games, which take the form of time-varying linear feedback gains. In the nonlinear case, we model the policies as nonlinear feedback gains, parameterized by self-attention layers to account for the time-varying multi-agent communication topology. We demonstrate that our distributed policy gradient approach achieves strong performance in several settings, including distributed linear and nonlinear regulation, and simulated and real multi-robot pursuit-and-evasion games.</p></details> |  |

Beyond conventional reward-seeking reinforcement learning (RL), the agent perceives and reasons over a multi-dimensional context that jointly captures queueing delay, link quality, coexistence intensity, and switching stability. A capacity-aware, quality of service (QoS)-constrained reward aligns the agent with goal-oriented scheduling rather than static thresholding. Under constrained bandwidth, the proposed design reduces blocking by up to 87.5% versus threshold policies while preserving throughput, highlighting the value of context-driven decisions in coexistence-limited NR SL networks. The proposed scheduler is an embodied agent (E-agent) tailored for task-specific, resource-efficient operation at the network edge.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures, accepted by 2025 IEEE Globecom Workshops</p></details> |

With the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), addressing ambiguity has become even more critical due to their expanded capabilities and applications. In the context of Conversational Question Answering (CQA), this paper explores the definition, forms, and implications of ambiguity for language driven systems, particularly in the context of LLMs. We define key terms and concepts, categorize various disambiguation approaches enabled by LLMs, and provide a comparative analysis of their advantages and disadvantages. We also explore publicly available datasets for benchmarking ambiguity detection and resolution techniques and highlight their relevance for ongoing research. Finally, we identify open problems and future research directions, especially in agentic settings, proposing areas for further investigation. By offering a comprehensive review of current research on ambiguities and disambiguation with LLMs, we aim to contribute to the development of more robust and reliable LLM-based systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 2 figures, Accepted at EMNLP 2025 Main Conference</p></details> |
| **[Fully Distributed State Estimation for Multi-agent Systems and its Application in Cooperative Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18292v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we investigate the distributed state estimation problem for a continuous-time linear multi-agent system (MAS) composed of $\mathit{m}$ agents and monitored by the agents themselves. To address this problem, we propose a distributed observer that enables each agent to reconstruct the state of the MAS. The main idea is to let each agent $\mathit{i}$ recover the state of agent $\mathit{j}$ by using leader-follower consensus rules to track agent $\mathit{j}$'s state estimate, which is generated by agent $\mathit{j}$ itself using a Luenberger-like estimation rule. Under the assumptions of node-level observability and topological ordering consistency, we show that the estimation error dynamics are stabilizable if and only if the communication graph is strongly connected. Moreover, we discuss the fully distributed design of the proposed observer, assuming that the agents only know basic MAS configuration information, such as the homogeneity and the maximum number of allowable agents. This design ensures that the proposed observer functions correctly when agents are added or removed. Building on this, we consider cooperative localization as a distributed estimation problem and develop two fully distributed localization algorithms that allow agents to track their own and other agents' positions (and velocities) within the MAS. Finally, we conduct simulations to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed theoretical results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Strategic Coordination for Evolving Multi-agent Systems: A Hierarchical Reinforcement and Collective Learning Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18088v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decentralized combinatorial optimization in evolving multi-agent systems poses significant challenges, requiring agents to balance long-term decision-making, short-term optimized collective outcomes, while preserving autonomy of interactive agents under unanticipated changes. Reinforcement learning offers a way to model sequential decision-making through dynamic programming to anticipate future environmental changes. However, applying multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to decentralized combinatorial optimization problems remains an open challenge due to the exponential growth of the joint state-action space, high communication overhead, and privacy concerns in centralized training. To address these limitations, this paper proposes Hierarchical Reinforcement and Collective Learning (HRCL), a novel approach that leverages both MARL and decentralized collective learning based on a hierarchical framework. Agents take high-level strategies using MARL to group possible plans for action space reduction and constrain the agent behavior for Pareto optimality. Meanwhile, the low-level collective learning layer ensures efficient and decentralized coordinated decisions among agents with minimal communication. Extensive experiments in a synthetic scenario and real-world smart city application models, including energy self-management and drone swarm sensing, demonstrate that HRCL significantly improves performance, scalability, and adaptability compared to the standalone MARL and collective learning approaches, achieving a win-win synthesis solution.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[ARK-V1: An LLM-Agent for Knowledge Graph Question Answering Requiring Commonsense Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18063v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) show strong reasoning abilities but rely on internalized knowledge that is often insufficient, outdated, or incorrect when trying to answer a question that requires specific domain knowledge. Knowledge Graphs (KGs) provide structured external knowledge, yet their complexity and multi-hop reasoning requirements make integration challenging. We present ARK-V1, a simple KG-agent that iteratively explores graphs to answer natural language queries. We evaluate several not fine-tuned state-of-the art LLMs as backbones for ARK-V1 on the CoLoTa dataset, which requires both KG-based and commonsense reasoning over long-tail entities. ARK-V1 achieves substantially higher conditional accuracies than Chain-of-Thought baselines, and larger backbone models show a clear trend toward better coverage, correctness, and stability.</p></details> | Work in Progess |
| **[Through the Lens of Human-Human Collaboration: A Configurable Research Platform for Exploring Human-Agent Collaboration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18008v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Intelligent systems have traditionally been designed as tools rather than collaborators, often lacking critical characteristics that collaboration partnerships require. Recent advances in large language model (LLM) agents open new opportunities for human-LLM-agent collaboration by enabling natural communication and various social and cognitive behaviors. Yet it remains unclear whether principles of computer-mediated collaboration established in HCI and CSCW persist, change, or fail when humans collaborate with LLM agents. To support systematic investigations of these questions, we introduce an open and configurable research platform for HCI researchers. The platform's modular design allows seamless adaptation of classic CSCW experiments and manipulation of theory-grounded interaction controls. We demonstrate the platform's effectiveness and usability through two case studies: (1) re-implementing the classic human-human-collaboration task Shape Factory as a between-subject human-agent-collaboration experiment with 16 participants, and (2) a participatory cognitive walkthrough with five HCI researchers to refine workflows and interfaces for experiment setup and analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[The STAR-XAI Protocol: An Interactive Framework for Inducing Second-Order Agency in AI Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17978v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) exhibit significant limitations in reliability and transparency, often showing a collapse in reasoning capabilities when faced with high-complexity, long-horizon tasks. This "illusion of thinking" is frequently an artifact of non-agentic, black-box evaluation paradigms that fail to cultivate robust problem-solving processes. In response, we introduce The STAR-XAI Protocol (Socratic, Transparent, Agentic, Reasoning - for eXplainable Artificial Intelligence), a novel methodology for training and operating verifiably reliable AI agents. Our method reframes the human-AI interaction as a structured, Socratic dialogue, governed by an explicit and evolving rulebook, the Consciousness Transfer Package (CTP). Through an interactive Gameplay Cycle that enforces ante-hoc strategic justification and a state-locking Checksum that prevents error accumulation, the protocol transforms a powerful but opaque LRM into a disciplined "Clear Box" agent. We demonstrate the efficacy of this method through an exhaustive 25-move case study in the complex strategic game "Caps i Caps". The agent not only solved the high-complexity puzzle but also demonstrated Second-Order Agency, identifying flaws in its own supervisor-approved plans and adapting its core integrity protocols mid-task. The STAR-XAI Protocol offers a practical pathway to creating AI agents that are not just high-performing, but also transparent, auditable, and trustworthy by design.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper 1 of 4 in The STAR-XAI Protocol series.

In this paper, we introduce Orcust, a framework that integrates Principle-Constrained Reward Modeling (PCRM) and Online VM-Grounded Trajectory Construction (OVTC) to enhance reasoning reliability and data efficiency in interactive GUI tasks. We leverages environment-verifiable and LLM-derived principle to enforce interpretable reward signals that constrain long chain-of-thought reasoning and rule-based feedback. OVTC spins up instrumented virtual machines to autonomously collect structured GUI interaction trajectories with explicit procedural and structural objectives, enabling the training of a stepwise reward model that robustly captures human preferences and adheres to task-specific constraints. Extensive experiments on standard GUI benchmarks covering perceptual grounding, foundational operations, and end-to-end task execution reveal that Orcust achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving by 22.2\% on ScreenSpot and 23.9\% on ScreenSpot-Pro over the base model (i.e. Qwen2.5-VL-7B). The results demonstrate Orcust's effectiveness in enhancing the reasoning, adaptability and scalability of GUI agents across various environments and task complexities.</p></details> |  |

This paper focuses on comparing novel agent system designs that use modular agents to analyze laboratory results, vital signs, and clinical context, and to predict and validate results. We implement our agent system with the eICU database, including running lab analysis, vitals-only interpreters, and contextual reasoners agents first, then sharing the memory into the integration agent, prediction agent, transparency agent, and a validation agent. Our results suggest that the multi-agent system (MAS) performed better than the single-agent system (SAS) with mortality prediction accuracy (59\%, 56\%) and the mean error for length of stay (LOS)(4.37 days, 5.82 days), respectively. However, the transparency score for the SAS (86.21) is slightly better than the transparency score for MAS (85.5). Finally, this study suggests that our agent-based framework not only improves process transparency and prediction accuracy but also strengthens trustworthy AI-assisted decision support in an intensive care setting.</p></details> |  |

Moreover, legal interpretation is rarely straightforward-ambiguity is pervasive, and judgments often hinge on subjective assessments. Compounding these challenges, contracts are usually confidential, restricting their use with proprietary models and necessitating reliance on open-source alternatives. To address these challenges, we introduce PAKTON: a fully open-source, end-to-end, multi-agent framework with plug-and-play capabilities. PAKTON is designed to handle the complexities of contract analysis through collaborative agent workflows and a novel retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) component, enabling automated legal document review that is more accessible, adaptable, and privacy-preserving. Experiments demonstrate that PAKTON outperforms both general-purpose and pretrained models in predictive accuracy, retrieval performance, explainability, completeness, and grounded justifications as evaluated through a human study and validated with automated metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP 2025</p></details> |

Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting induces significant latency due to multi-turn reasoning; per-account fine-tuning is computationally prohibitive; and long prompt-based methods degrade the model's ability to grasp injected context and style. In this paper, we propose WeStar, a lite-adaptive framework for stylized contextual question answering that scales to millions of official accounts. WeStar combines context-grounded generation via RAG with style-aware generation using Parametric RAG (PRAG), where LoRA modules are dynamically activated per style cluster. Our contributions are fourfold: (1) We introduce WeStar, a unified framework capable of serving large volumes of official accounts with minimal overhead. (2) We propose a multi-dimensional, cluster-based parameter sharing scheme that enables compact style representation while preserving stylistic diversity. (3) We develop a style-enhanced Direct Preference Optimization (SeDPO) method to optimize each style cluster's parameters for improved generation quality. (4) Experiments on a large-scale industrial dataset validate the effectiveness and efficiency of WeStar, underscoring its pracitical value in real-world deployment.</p></details> | 7 pages |
| **[A Large Language Model-based multi-agent manufacturing system for intelligent shopfloor](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16887v2)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As customer demand for multi-variety and small-batch production increases, dynamic disturbances place greater demands on manufacturing systems. To address such challenges, researchers proposed the multi-agent manufacturing system. However, conventional agent negotiation typically relies on pre-defined and fixed heuristic rules, which are ill-suited to managing complex and fluctuating disturbances. In current implementations, mainstream approaches based on reinforcement learning require the development of simulators and training models specific to a given shopfloor, necessitating substantial computational resources and lacking scalability. To overcome this limitation, the present study proposes a Large Language Model-based (LLM-based) multi-agent manufacturing system for intelligent shopfloor management. By defining the diverse modules of agents and their collaborative methods, this system facilitates the processing of all workpieces with minimal human intervention. The agents in this system consist of the Machine Server Module (MSM), Bid Inviter Module (BIM), Bidder Module (BM), Thinking Module (TM), and Decision Module (DM). By harnessing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, these modules enable agents to dynamically analyze shopfloor information and select appropriate processing machines. The LLM-based modules, predefined by system prompts, provide dynamic functionality for the system without the need for pre-training. Extensive experiments were conducted in physical shopfloor settings. The results demonstrate that the proposed system exhibits strong adaptability, and achieves superior performance (makespan) and stability (as measured by sample standard deviation) compared to other approaches without requiring pre-training.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Agent Amodal Completion: Direct Synthesis with Fine-Grained Semantic Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17757v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Amodal completion, generating invisible parts of occluded objects, is vital for applications like image editing and AR. Prior methods face challenges with data needs, generalization, or error accumulation in progressive pipelines. We propose a Collaborative Multi-Agent Reasoning Framework based on upfront collaborative reasoning to overcome these issues. Our framework uses multiple agents to collaboratively analyze occlusion relationships and determine necessary boundary expansion, yielding a precise mask for inpainting. Concurrently, an agent generates fine-grained textual descriptions, enabling Fine-Grained Semantic Guidance. This ensures accurate object synthesis and prevents the regeneration of occluders or other unwanted elements, especially within large inpainting areas. Furthermore, our method directly produces layered RGBA outputs guided by visible masks and attention maps from a Diffusion Transformer, eliminating extra segmentation. Extensive evaluations demonstrate our framework achieves state-of-the-art visual quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[An LLM-based Agent Simulation Approach to Study Moral Evolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17703v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The evolution of morality presents a puzzle: natural selection should favor self-interest, yet humans developed moral systems promoting altruism. We address this question by introducing a novel Large Language Model (LLM)-based agent simulation framework modeling prehistoric hunter-gatherer societies. This platform is designed to probe diverse questions in social evolution, from survival advantages to inter-group dynamics. To investigate moral evolution, we designed agents with varying moral dispositions based on the Expanding Circle Theory \citep{singer1981expanding}. We evaluated their evolutionary success across a series of simulations and analyzed their decision-making in specially designed moral dilemmas. These experiments reveal how an agent's moral framework, in combination with its cognitive constraints, directly shapes its behavior and determines its evolutionary outcome. Crucially, the emergent patterns echo seminal theories from related domains of social science, providing external validation for the simulations. This work establishes LLM-based simulation as a powerful new paradigm to complement traditional research in evolutionary biology and anthropology, opening new avenues for investigating the complexities of moral and social evolution.</p></details> |  |

However, achieving high energy efficiency in such networks remains a critical challenge, particularly in large-scale or dynamically changing environments. Traditional terrestrial LoRa deployments often suffer from coverage gaps and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) propagation losses, while satellite-based IoT solutions consume excessive energy and introduce high latency, limiting their suitability for energy-constrained and delay-sensitive applications. To address these limitations, we propose a novel architecture using multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as flying LoRa gateways to dynamically collect data from ground-based LoRa end devices. Our approach aims to maximize the system's weighted global energy efficiency by jointly optimizing spreading factors, transmission powers, UAV trajectories, and end-device associations. Additionally, we formulate this complex optimization problem as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) and propose green LoRa multi-agent proximal policy optimization (GLo-MAPPO), a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework based on centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE). Simulation results show that GLo-MAPPO significantly outperforms benchmark algorithms, achieving energy efficiency improvements of 71.25%, 18.56%, 67.00%, 59.73%, and 49.95% for networks with 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 LoRa end devices, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 19 figures, journal</p></details> |

However, their reasoning and coordination capabilities in complex, multi-stage scenarios remain underexplored. Existing benchmarks typically focus on isolated tasks or narrow domains, overlooking models' abilities for multi-stage collaboration and optimization without explicit external guidance. To bridge this gap, we propose \textbf{MSCoRe}, a novel benchmark comprising 126696 domain-specific QA instances spanning scenarios in automotive, pharmaceutical, electronics, and energy sectors. The dataset is created using a structured three-phase pipeline: dynamic sampling, iterative question-answer generation, and a multi-level quality assessment to ensure data quality. Tasks are further categorized into three difficulty levels according to stage coverage and complexity. With MSCoRe, we have conducted a comprehensive evaluation of various state-of-the-art LLM agents. The commercial models performed best across all tasks and scenarios, but a notable gap in ROUGE scores remains between simple and complex tasks. We also tested the models' robustness and found that their performance is negatively affected by noisy data. MSCoRe provides a valuable new resource for the community to evaluate and improve multi-stage reasoning in LLM agents. The code and data are available at https://github.com/D3E0-source/MSCoRE.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Comparing Data Assimilation and Likelihood-Based Inference on Latent State Estimation in Agent-Based Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17625v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we present the first systematic comparison of Data Assimilation (DA) and Likelihood-Based Inference (LBI) in the context of Agent-Based Models (ABMs). These models generate observable time series driven by evolving, partially-latent microstates. Latent states need to be estimated to align simulations with real-world data -- a task traditionally addressed by DA, especially in continuous and equation-based models such as those used in weather forecasting. However, the nature of ABMs poses challenges for standard DA methods. Solving such issues requires adaptation of previous DA techniques, or ad-hoc alternatives such as LBI. DA approximates the likelihood in a model-agnostic way, making it broadly applicable but potentially less precise. In contrast, LBI provides more accurate state estimation by directly leveraging the model's likelihood, but at the cost of requiring a hand-crafted, model-specific likelihood function, which may be complex or infeasible to derive. We compare the two methods on the Bounded-Confidence Model, a well-known opinion dynamics ABM, where agents are affected only by others holding sufficiently similar opinions. We find that LBI better recovers latent agent-level opinions, even under model mis-specification, leading to improved individual-level forecasts. At the aggregate level, however, both methods perform comparably, and DA remains competitive across levels of aggregation under certain parameter settings. Our findings suggest that DA is well-suited for aggregate predictions, while LBI is preferable for agent-level inference.</p></details> |  |
| **[Human vs. Agent in Task-Oriented Conversations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17619v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Task-oriented conversational systems are essential for efficiently addressing diverse user needs, yet their development requires substantial amounts of high-quality conversational data that is challenging and costly to obtain. While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in generating synthetic conversations, the extent to which these agent-generated interactions can effectively substitute real human conversations remains unclear. This work presents the first systematic comparison between LLM-simulated users and human users in personalized task-oriented conversations. We propose a comprehensive analytical framework encompassing three key aspects (conversation strategy, interaction style, and conversation evaluation) and ten distinct dimensions for evaluating user behaviors, and collect parallel conversational datasets from both human users and LLM agent users across four representative scenarios under identical conditions. Our analysis reveals significant behavioral differences between the two user types in problem-solving approaches, question broadness, user engagement, context dependency, feedback polarity and promise, language style, and hallucination awareness. We found consistency in the agent users and human users across the depth-first or breadth-first dimensions, as well as the usefulness dimensions. These findings provide critical insights for advancing LLM-based user simulation. Our multi-dimensional taxonomy constructed a generalizable framework for analyzing user behavior patterns, offering insights from LLM agent users and human users. By this work, we provide perspectives on rethinking how to use user simulation in conversational systems in the future.</p></details> | SIGIR-AP 2025 |
| **[Agentic AI for Software: thoughts from Software Engineering community](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17343v4)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI agents have recently shown significant promise in software engineering. Much public attention has been transfixed on the topic of code generation from Large Language Models (LLMs) via a prompt. However, software engineering is much more than programming, and AI agents go far beyond instructions given by a prompt. At the code level, common software tasks include code generation, testing, and program repair. Design level software tasks may include architecture exploration, requirements understanding, and requirements enforcement at the code level. Each of these software tasks involves micro-decisions which can be taken autonomously by an AI agent, aided by program analysis tools. This creates the vision of an AI software engineer, where the AI agent can be seen as a member of a development team. Conceptually, the key to successfully developing trustworthy agentic AI-based software workflows will be to resolve the core difficulty in software engineering - the deciphering and clarification of developer intent. Specification inference, or deciphering the intent, thus lies at the heart of many software tasks, including software maintenance and program repair. A successful deployment of agentic technology into software engineering would involve making conceptual progress in such intent inference via agents. Trusting the AI agent becomes a key aspect, as software engineering becomes more automated. Higher automation also leads to higher volume of code being automatically generated, and then integrated into code-bases. Thus to deal with this explosion, an emerging direction is AI-based verification and validation (V & V) of AI generated code. We posit that agentic software workflows in future will include such AIbased V&V.</p></details> | 4 pages |

Current frameworks for multi-agent debate are often designed towards tool use, lack integrated evaluation, or provide limited configurability of agent personas, response generators, discussion paradigms, and decision protocols. We introduce MALLM (Multi-Agent Large Language Models), an open-source framework that enables systematic analysis of MAD components. MALLM offers more than 144 unique configurations of MAD, including (1) agent personas (e.g., Expert, Personality), (2) response generators (e.g., Critical, Reasoning), (3) discussion paradigms (e.g., Memory, Relay), and (4) decision protocols (e.g., Voting, Consensus). MALLM uses simple configuration files to define a debate. Furthermore, MALLM can load any textual Hugging Face dataset (e.g., MMLU-Pro, WinoGrande) and provides an evaluation pipeline for easy comparison of MAD configurations. MALLM enables researchers to systematically configure, run, and evaluate debates for their problems, facilitating the understanding of the components and their interplay.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP 2025 (Demo)</p></details> |
| **[RIDAS: A Multi-Agent Framework for AI-RAN with Representation- and Intention-Driven Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13140v4)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sixth generation (6G) networks demand tight integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into radio access networks (RANs) to meet stringent quality of service (QoS) and resource efficiency requirements. Existing solutions struggle to bridge the gap between high level user intents and the low level, parameterized configurations required for optimal performance. To address this challenge, we propose RIDAS, a multi agent framework composed of representation driven agents (RDAs) and an intention driven agent (IDA). RDAs expose open interface with tunable control parameters (rank and quantization bits, enabling explicit trade) offs between distortion and transmission rate. The IDA employs a two stage planning scheme (bandwidth pre allocation and reallocation) driven by a large language model (LLM) to map user intents and system state into optimal RDA configurations. Experiments demonstrate that RIDAS supports 36.47% more users than WirelessAgent under equivalent QoS constraints. These results validate ability of RIDAS to capture user intent and allocate resources more efficiently in AI RAN environments.</p></details> | 6 pages, 7 figures |

We present MapCoder-Lite, which upgrades a single 7B model into four role-specialised agents-retriever, planner, coder, and debugger-using only rank-32, role-specific LoRA adapters ($<3\%$ extra parameters). Three lightweight techniques make this possible: (i) trajectory distillation from strong LLMs fixes format fragility in retrieval and debugging, (ii) supervisor-guided correction strengthens planning and coding agents, and (iii) agent-wise LoRA fine-tuning delivers memory-efficient specialisation. Comprehensive evaluation on xCodeEval, APPS, and CodeContests shows that MapCoder-Lite more than doubles xCodeEval accuracy (from $13.2\%$ to $28.3\%$), eliminates all format failures, and closes to within six points of a 32B baseline while cutting GPU memory and token-generation time by $4\times$. These results demonstrate that careful agent-wise fine-tuning unleashes high-quality multi-agent coding on a small language model.</p></details> |  |

While recent work reveals significant gaps between LLMs' privacy Q&A performance and their agent behavior, existing benchmarks remain limited to static, simplified scenarios. We present PrivacyChecker, a model-agnostic, contextual integrity based mitigation approach that effectively reduces privacy leakage from 36.08% to 7.30% on DeepSeek-R1 and from 33.06% to 8.32% on GPT-4o, all while preserving task helpfulness. We also introduce PrivacyLens-Live, transforming static benchmarks into dynamic MCP and A2A environments that reveal substantially higher privacy risks in practical. Our modular mitigation approach integrates seamlessly into agent protocols through three deployment strategies, providing practical privacy protection for the emerging agentic ecosystem.

However, existing approaches to strategy planning for proactive dialogue face several limitations: limited strategy coverage, preference bias in planning, and reliance on costly additional training. To address these, we propose PRINCIPLES: a synthetic strategy memory for proactive dialogue agents. PRINCIPLES is derived through offline self-play simulations and serves as reusable knowledge that guides strategy planning during inference, eliminating the need for additional training and data annotation. We evaluate PRINCIPLES in both emotional support and persuasion domains, demonstrating consistent improvements over strong baselines. Furthermore, PRINCIPLES maintains its robustness across extended and more diverse evaluation settings.

The advancement of multi-agent systems has further en-hanced the capabilities of LLMs. Inspired by the structure of multi-polar neurons (MNs), we propose the XAgents framework, an in-terpretable multi-agent cooperative framework based on the IF-THEN rule-based system. The IF-Parts of the rules are responsible for logical reasoning and domain membership calculation, while the THEN-Parts are comprised of domain expert agents that generate domain-specific contents. Following the calculation of the member-ship, XAgetns transmits the task to the disparate domain rules, which subsequently generate the various responses. These re-sponses are analogous to the answers provided by different experts to the same question. The final response is reached at by eliminat-ing the hallucinations and erroneous knowledge of the LLM through membership computation and semantic adversarial genera-tion of the various domain rules. The incorporation of rule-based interpretability serves to bolster user confidence in the XAgents framework. We evaluate the efficacy of XAgents through a com-parative analysis with the latest AutoAgents, in which XAgents demonstrated superior performance across three distinct datasets. We perform post-hoc interpretable studies with SHAP algorithm and case studies, proving the interpretability of XAgent in terms of input-output feature correlation and rule-based semantics.</p></details> | <details><summary>We in...</summary><p>We intend to substantially revise the problem statement and scope; therefore we withdraw the current version</p></details> |

Their ability to assume roles and personalities based on predefined character biographies has positioned them as cost-effective substitutes for human participants in social science research. This paper explores the validity of such persona-based agents in representing human populations; we recreate the HEXACO personality inventory experiment by surveying 310 GPT-4 powered agents, conducting factor analysis on their responses, and comparing these results to the original findings presented by Ashton, Lee, & Goldberg in 2004. Our results found 1) a coherent and reliable personality structure was recoverable from the agents' responses demonstrating partial alignment to the HEXACO framework. 2) the derived personality dimensions were consistent and reliable within GPT-4, when coupled with a sufficiently curated population, and 3) cross-model analysis revealed variability in personality profiling, suggesting model-specific biases and limitations. We discuss the practical considerations and challenges encountered during the experiment. This study contributes to the ongoing discourse on the potential benefits and limitations of using generative agents in social science research and provides useful guidance on designing consistent and representative agent personas to maximise coverage and representation of human personality traits.</p></details> |  |

To bridge this gap, we introduce ReasonMed, the largest medical reasoning dataset to date, comprising 370k high-quality examples distilled from 1.75 million initial reasoning paths generated by complementary LLMs and curated through a cost-efficient easy-medium-difficult (EMD) pipeline. ReasonMed is built through a multi-agent generation, verification, and refinement process, in which an Error Refiner improves reasoning paths by correcting error-prone steps identified by a verifier. Using ReasonMed, we investigate effective strategies for training medical reasoning models and find that integrating detailed CoT reasoning with concise answer summaries yields the most robust fine-tuning results. Models trained on ReasonMed set a new benchmark: ReasonMed-7B surpasses the prior best sub-10B models by 4.17% and even exceeds LLaMA3.1-70B on PubMedQA by 4.60%. When scaled to ReasonMed-14B, it remains highly competitive, underscoring consistent scaling potential.

However, research in this area has been severely hampered by the lack of large-scale, diverse datasets with precise, ground-truth error labels. To address this bottleneck, we introduce \textbf{AEGIS}, a novel framework for \textbf{A}utomated \textbf{E}rror \textbf{G}eneration and \textbf{I}dentification for Multi-Agent \textbf{S}ystems. By systematically injecting controllable and traceable errors into initially successful trajectories, we create a rich dataset of realistic failures. This is achieved using a context-aware, LLM-based adaptive manipulator that performs sophisticated attacks like prompt injection and response corruption to induce specific, predefined error modes. We demonstrate the value of our dataset by exploring three distinct learning paradigms for the error identification task: Supervised Fine-Tuning, Reinforcement Learning, and Contrastive Learning. Our comprehensive experiments show that models trained on AEGIS data achieve substantial improvements across all three learning paradigms. Notably, several of our fine-tuned models demonstrate performance competitive with or superior to proprietary systems an order of magnitude larger, validating our automated data generation framework as a crucial resource for developing more robust and interpretable multi-agent systems.

| **[Asteria: Semantic-Aware Cross-Region Caching for Agentic LLM Tool Access](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17360v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM) agents tackle data-intensive tasks such as deep research and code generation. However, their effectiveness depends on frequent interactions with knowledge sources across remote clouds or regions. Such interactions can create non-trivial latency and cost bottlenecks. Existing caching solutions focus on exact-match queries, limiting their effectiveness for semantic knowledge reuse. To address this challenge, we introduce Asteria, a novel cross-region knowledge caching architecture for LLM agents. At its core are two abstractions: Semantic Element (SE) and Semantic Retrieval Index (Sine). A semantic element captures the semantic embedding representation of an LLM query together with performance-aware metadata such as latency, cost, and staticity. Sine then provides two-stage retrieval: a vector similar index with semantic embedding for fast candidate selection and a lightweight LLM-powered semantic judger for precise validation. Atop these primitives, Asteria builds a new cache interface that includes a new semantic-aware cache hit definition, a cost-efficient eviction policy, and proactive prefetching. To reduce overhead, Asteria co-locates the small LLM judger with the main LLM using adaptive scheduling and resource sharing. Our evaluation demonstrates that Asteria delivers substantial performance improvements without compromising correctness. On representative search workloads, Asteria achieves up to a 3.6$\times$ increase in throughput by maintaining cache hit rates of over 85%, while preserving accuracy virtually identical to non-cached baselines. Asteria also improves throughput for complex coding tasks by 20%, showcasing its versatility across diverse agentic workloads.</p></details> |  |

Utilizing the Anthropic Helpful-Harmless RLHF dataset, we train and evaluate four models: the base OPT350M, an SFT model, a DPO model, and a model trained with both SFT and DPO. We introduce three key evaluation metrics: Harmlessness Rate (HmR), Helpfulness Rate (HpR), and a Combined Alignment Score (CAS), all derived from reward model outputs. The results show that while SFT outperforms DPO, The combined SFT+DPO model outperforms all others across all metrics, demonstrating the complementary nature of these techniques. Our findings also highlight challenges posed by noisy data, limited GPU resources, and training constraints.

However, the evolution and mechanism behind the synergy of SFT and RL are still under-explored and inconclusive. In our study, we find the well-known claim "SFT memorizes, RL generalizes" is over-simplified, and discover that: (1) OOD performance peaks at the early stage of SFT and then declines (OOD forgetting), the best SFT checkpoint cannot be captured by training/test loss; (2) the subsequent RL stage does not generate fundamentally better OOD capability, instead it plays an \textbf{OOD restoration} role, recovering the lost reasoning ability during SFT; (3) The recovery ability has boundaries, \ie{} \textbf{if SFT trains for too short or too long, RL cannot recover the lost OOD ability;} (4) To uncover the underlying mechanisms behind the forgetting and restoration process, we employ SVD analysis on parameter matrices, manually edit them, and observe their impacts on model performance. Unlike the common belief that the shift of model capacity mainly results from the changes of singular values, we find that they are actually quite stable throughout fine-tuning. Instead, the OOD behavior strongly correlates with the \textbf{rotation of singular vectors}. Our findings re-identify the roles of SFT and RL in the two-stage fine-tuning and discover the rotation of singular vectors as the key mechanism. %reversing the rotations induced by SFT, which shows recovery from forgetting, whereas imposing the SFT parameter directions onto a RL-tuned model results in performance degradation.

| **[Beyond Two-Stage Training: Cooperative SFT and RL for LLM Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06948v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven effective in incentivizing the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), but suffers from severe efficiency challenges due to its trial-and-error nature. While the common practice employs supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a warm-up stage for RL, this decoupled two-stage approach limits interaction between SFT and RL, thereby constraining overall effectiveness. This study introduces a novel method for learning reasoning models that employs bilevel optimization to facilitate better cooperation between these training paradigms. By conditioning the SFT objective on the optimal RL policy, our approach enables SFT to meta-learn how to guide RL's optimization process. During training, the lower level performs RL updates while simultaneously receiving SFT supervision, and the upper level explicitly maximizes the cooperative gain-the performance advantage of joint SFT-RL training over RL alone. Empirical evaluations on five reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms baselines and achieves a better balance between effectiveness and efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Empowering Lightweight MLLMs with Reasoning via Long CoT SFT](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03321v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards has enhanced the reasoning of large-scale language models (LLMs), its efficacy for lightweight multimodal language models (MLLMs) with fewer than seven billion parameters remains underexplored. This paper investigates the role of long Chain-of-Thought (long CoT) data in enhancing the reasoning abilities of such MLLMs. Our findings demonstrate that Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with long CoT data significantly improves MLLM reasoning. Furthermore, we observe that after this initial SFT phase, MLLMs can achieve additional performance gains through a subsequent RL stage. We conclude that a SFT stage with long CoT data is a critical prerequisite for developing the reasoning capabilities of lightweight MLLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Blockwise SFT for Diffusion Language Models: Reconciling Bidirectional Attention and Autoregressive Decoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19529v1)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Discrete diffusion language models have shown strong potential for text generation, yet standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT) misaligns with their semi-autoregressive inference: training randomly masks tokens across the entire response, while inference generates fixed-size blocks sequentially. This mismatch introduces noisy prefixes and leaky suffixes, biasing gradients away from the desired blockwise likelihood. We propose Blockwise SFT, which partitions responses into fixed-size blocks, selects one active block per step for stochastic masking, freezes all preceding tokens, and fully hides future ones. Loss is computed only over the active block, directly mirroring the blockwise decoding process. Experiments on GSM8K, MATH, and MetaMathQA show consistent gains over classical SFT under equal compute or token budgets. Block size consistency studies and ablations confirm that improvements stem from faithful training-inference alignment rather than incidental masking effects. Our results highlight the importance of matching supervision granularity to the decoding procedure in diffusion-based language models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Breaking the SFT Plateau: Multimodal Structured Reinforcement Learning for Chart-to-Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13587v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While reinforcement learning (RL) has proven highly effective for general reasoning in vision-language models, its application to tasks requiring in-depth understanding of information-rich images and generation of structured outputs remains underexplored. Chart-to-code generation exemplifies this challenge, demanding complex reasoning over visual charts to generate structured code. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) alone is often insufficient, highlighting the need for effective RL strategies that appropriately reward structured outputs. We systematically investigate the performance plateau in SFT through large-scale experiments and propose Multimodal Structured Reinforcement Learning (MSRL) for chart-to-code generation, which substantially breaks through this plateau. We construct the largest training corpus to date, containing 3 million chart-code pairs from real-world arXiv tables to mitigate simplistic patterns of prior synthetic data. Despite reaching state-of-the-art performance, our experiments show that scaling SFT data eventually hits a plateau where further increases yield negligible improvements. Our MSRL method leverages a multi-granularity structured reward system using multimodal textual and visual feedback. At the textual level, rule-based rewards validate fine-grained code details. At the visual level, model-based rewards assess structural similarity by rendering generated code into images and employing an evaluator model. We implement this within a two-stage curriculum for training stability. Results demonstrate that MSRL significantly breaks the SFT plateau, improving high-level metrics by 6.2% and 9.9% on ChartMimic and ReachQA benchmarks respectively, achieving competitive performance with advanced closed-source models.</p></details> | technical report |
| **[On the Generalization of SFT: A Reinforcement Learning Perspective with Reward Rectification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05629v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a simple yet theoretically motivated improvement to Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) for the Large Language Model (LLM), addressing its limited generalization compared to reinforcement learning (RL). Through mathematical analysis, we reveal that standard SFT gradients implicitly encode a problematic reward structure that may severely restrict the generalization capabilities of model. To rectify this, we propose Dynamic Fine-Tuning (DFT), stabilizing gradient updates for each token by dynamically rescaling the objective function with the probability of this token. Remarkably, this single-line code change significantly outperforms standard SFT across multiple challenging benchmarks and base models, demonstrating greatly improved generalization. Additionally, our approach shows competitive results in offline RL settings, offering an effective yet simpler alternative. This work bridges theoretical insight and practical solutions, substantially advancing SFT performance.

| **[Scalpel vs. Hammer: GRPO Amplifies Existing Capabilities, SFT Replaces Them](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10616v2)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training large language models (LLMs) for reasoning via maths and code datasets has become a major new focus in LLM post-training. Two particularly popular approaches are reinforcement learning (RL) and supervised fine-tuning (SFT), but their training dynamics are poorly understood. We present a comparative analysis of RL and SFT on the same maths problems with the same model and similar hyperparameters. We find that RL yields minor in-domain gains on maths and slight degradation on knowledge-intensive benchmarks like MMLU, while both trends are more pronounced in SFT. We also analyse model parameters across checkpoints, observing that both algorithms modify query and key weights the most. Meanwhile, SFT exhibits greater updates and also affects mid-layer MLPs more, leading us to hypothesise that this may have caused the out-of-domain degradation. We therefore investigate whether freezing parts of the model during training can mitigate the reduced performance on knowledge-intensive benchmarks. However, our results are inconclusive, with benefits on GPQA:Diamond and degradation on other benchmarks. Taken together, our observations provide a preliminary indication for why RL amplifies existing capabilities, while SFT replaces old skills with new ones.</p></details> |  |

While text-based reasoning models (e.g., Deepseek R1) show promising results in text-only tasks, distilling their reasoning into LVLMs via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) often results in performance degradation due to imprecise visual grounding. Conversely, purely reinforcement learning (RL)-based methods face a large search space, hindering the emergence of reflective behaviors in smaller models (e.g., 7B LVLMs). Surprisingly, alternating between SFT and RL ultimately results in significant performance improvements after a few iterations. Our analysis reveals that the base model rarely exhibits reasoning behaviors initially, but SFT effectively surfaces these latent actions and narrows the RL search space, accelerating the development of reasoning capabilities. Each subsequent RL stage further refines the model's reasoning skills, producing higher-quality SFT data for continued self-improvement. OpenVLThinker-7B consistently advances performance across six benchmarks demanding mathematical and general reasoning, notably improving MathVista by 3.8%, EMMA by 2.4%, and HallusionBench by 1.6%. Beyond demonstrating the synergy between SFT and RL for complex reasoning tasks, our findings provide early evidence towards achieving R1-style reasoning in multimodal contexts.

While Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) are the dominant training paradigms, a systematic methodology for combining them to maximize both accuracy and efficiency remains largely unexplored. This paper introduces a practical and effective training recipe that strategically integrates extended SFT with RL from online inference (GRPO). We posit that these methods play complementary, not competing, roles: a prolonged SFT phase first pushes the model's accuracy to its limits, after which a GRPO phase dramatically improves token efficiency while preserving this peak performance. Our experiments reveal that extending SFT for as many as 10 epochs is crucial for performance breakthroughs, and that the primary role of GRPO in this framework is to optimize solution length. The efficacy of our recipe is rigorously validated through top-tier performance on challenging benchmarks, including a high rank among over 2,200 teams in the strictly leak-free AI Mathematical Olympiad (AIMO). This work provides the community with a battle-tested blueprint for developing state-of-the-art mathematical reasoners that are both exceptionally accurate and practically efficient.

While these methods exhibit synergy in language-only models, their joint effectiveness in VLMs remains uncertain. We present a systematic investigation into the distinct roles and interplay of long-CoT SFT and RL across multiple multimodal reasoning benchmarks. We find that SFT improves performance on difficult questions by in-depth, structured reasoning, but introduces verbosity and degrades performance on simpler ones. In contrast, RL promotes generalization and brevity, yielding consistent improvements across all difficulty levels, though the improvements on the hardest questions are less prominent compared to SFT. Surprisingly, combining them through two-staged, interleaved, or progressive training strategies, as well as data mixing and model merging, all fails to produce additive benefits, instead leading to trade-offs in accuracy, reasoning style, and response length. This ``synergy dilemma'' highlights the need for more seamless and adaptive approaches to unlock the full potential of combined post-training techniques for reasoning VLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Implicit Reward as the Bridge: A Unified View of SFT and DPO Connections](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00018v2)** | 2025-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Post-training processes are essential phases in grounding pre-trained language models to real-world tasks, with learning from demonstrations or preference signals playing a crucial role in this adaptation. We present a unified theoretical framework bridging Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and preference learning in Large Language Model (LLM) post-training. Through rigorous mathematical derivation, we demonstrate that both SFT and preference learning methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) operate within the same optimal policy-reward subspace, with SFT representing a special case of implicit reward learning. Our analysis reveals a critical limitation in conventional SFT: the KL divergence term in distribution matching becomes constant with respect to the policy during optimization, failing to constrain model updates. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective learning rate reduction approach that yields significant performance improvements (up to \textbf{25\%} relative gain and \textbf{6\%} absolute win rate increase in instruction following tasks. Additionally, we derive alternative SFT objectives from various f-divergence functions that preserve the KL term during optimization, further enhancing post-DPO model performance. Finally, we extend the theoretical relationship between LLM logits and Q-functions from preference learning to the SFT context, providing mathematical derivations and experimental validation.</p></details> |  |

In order to preserve the advantages of both SFT and RL -- namely, eliminating the need for paired data and reward models while retaining the training stability of SFT and the generalization ability of RL -- a new alignment method, Self-Sampling Preference Optimization (SSPO), is proposed in this paper. SSPO introduces a Random Checkpoint Replay (RCR) strategy that utilizes historical checkpoints to construct paired data, thereby effectively mitigating overfitting. Simultaneously, a Self-Sampling Regularization (SSR) strategy is employed to dynamically evaluate the quality of generated samples; when the generated samples are more likely to be winning samples, the approach automatically switches from DPO (Direct Preference Optimization) to SFT, ensuring that the training process accurately reflects the quality of the samples. Experimental results demonstrate that SSPO not only outperforms existing methods on text-to-image benchmarks, but its effectiveness has also been validated in text-to-video tasks. We validate SSPO across both text-to-image and text-to-video benchmarks. SSPO surpasses all previous approaches on the text-to-image benchmarks and demonstrates outstanding performance on the text-to-video benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

However, existing approaches often fall short: methods solely employing reinforcement learning (RL) can struggle with sample inefficiency and activating entirely absent reasoning capabilities, while conventional pipelines that initiate with a cold-start supervised fine-tuning (SFT) phase before RL may restrict the model's exploratory capacity and face suboptimal convergence. In this work, we introduce \textbf{Metis-RISE} (\textbf{R}L \textbf{I}ncentivizes and \textbf{S}FT \textbf{E}nhances) for multimodal reasoning model learning. Unlike conventional approaches, Metis-RISE distinctively omits an initial SFT stage, beginning instead with an RL phase (e.g., using a Group Relative Policy Optimization variant) to incentivize and activate the model's latent reasoning capacity. Subsequently, the targeted SFT stage addresses two key challenges identified during RL: (1) \textit{inefficient trajectory sampling} for tasks where the model possesses but inconsistently applies correct reasoning, which we tackle using self-distilled reasoning trajectories from the RL model itself; and (2) \textit{fundamental capability absence}, which we address by injecting expert-augmented knowledge for prompts where the model entirely fails. This strategic application of RL for incentivization followed by SFT for enhancement forms the core of Metis-RISE, leading to two versions of our MLLMs (7B and 72B parameters). Evaluations on the OpenCompass Multimodal Reasoning Leaderboard demonstrate that both models achieve state-of-the-art performance among similar-sized models, with the 72B version ranking fourth overall.

The standard training approach combines a supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage, often to distill capabilities of a larger model, followed by a reinforcement learning (RL)stage such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). In this paper, we investigate the fundamental limitations of this SFT + RL paradigm and propose methods to overcome them. Under a suitable theoretical model, we demonstrate that the SFT + RL strategy can fail completely when (1) the expert's traces are too difficult for the small model to express, or (2) the small model's initialization has exponentially small likelihood of success. To address these, we introduce BREAD: a GRPO variant that unifies the SFT and RL stages via partial expert guidance and branched rollouts. When self-generated traces fail, BREAD adaptively inserts short expert prefixes/hints, allowing the small model to complete the rest of the reasoning path, and ensuring that each update includes at least one successful trace. This mechanism both densifies the reward signal and induces a natural learning curriculum. BREAD requires fewer than 40% of ground-truth traces, consistently outperforming standard GRPO while speeding up the training by about 3 times. Importantly, we demonstrate that BREAD helps the model solve problems that are otherwise unsolvable by the SFT + RL strategy, highlighting how branched rollouts and expert guidance can substantially boost SLM reasoning.</p></details> |  |

We begin by curating the SFT training data through two scaling strategies: increasing the number of collected prompts and the number of generated responses per prompt. Both approaches yield notable improvements in reasoning performance, with scaling the number of prompts resulting in more substantial gains. We then explore the following questions regarding the synergy between SFT and RL: (i) Does a stronger SFT model consistently lead to better final performance after large-scale RL training? (ii) How can we determine an appropriate sampling temperature during RL training to effectively balance exploration and exploitation for a given SFT initialization? Our findings suggest that (i) holds true, provided effective RL training is conducted, particularly when the sampling temperature is carefully chosen to maintain the temperature-adjusted entropy around 0.3, a setting that strikes a good balance between exploration and exploitation. Notably, the performance gap between initial SFT models narrows significantly throughout the RL process. Leveraging a strong SFT foundation and insights into the synergistic interplay between SFT and RL, our AceReason-Nemotron-1.1 7B model significantly outperforms AceReason-Nemotron-1.0 and achieves new state-of-the-art performance among Qwen2.5-7B-based reasoning models on challenging math and code benchmarks, thereby demonstrating the effectiveness of our post-training recipe.

| **[How Much Backtracking is Enough? Exploring the Interplay of SFT and RL in Enhancing LLM Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24273v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs) have effectively improved their reasoning abilities, particularly on mathematical and logical problems that have verifiable answers, through techniques such as supervised finetuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL). Prior research indicates that RL effectively internalizes search strategies, enabling long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, with backtracking emerging naturally as a learned capability. However, the precise benefits of backtracking, specifically, how significantly it contributes to reasoning improvements and the optimal extent of its use, remain poorly understood. In this work, we systematically investigate the dynamics between SFT and RL on eight reasoning tasks: Countdown, Sudoku, Arc 1D, Geometry, Color Cube Rotation, List Functions, Zebra Puzzles, and Self Reference. Our findings highlight that short CoT sequences used in SFT as a warm-up do have moderate contribution to RL training, compared with cold-start RL; however such contribution diminishes when tasks become increasingly difficult. Motivated by this observation, we construct synthetic datasets varying systematically in the number of backtracking steps and conduct controlled experiments to isolate the influence of either the correctness (content) or the structure (i.e., backtrack frequency). We find that (1) longer CoT with backtracks generally induce better and more stable RL training, (2) more challenging problems with larger search space tend to need higher numbers of backtracks during the SFT stage. Additionally, we demonstrate through experiments on distilled data that RL training is largely unaffected by the correctness of long CoT sequences, suggesting that RL prioritizes structural patterns over content correctness. Collectively, our results offer practical insights into designing optimal training strategies to effectively scale reasoning in LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[SFT Memorizes, RL Generalizes: A Comparative Study of Foundation Model Post-training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17161v2)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) are widely used post-training techniques for foundation models. However, their roles in enhancing model generalization capabilities remain unclear. This paper studies the difference between SFT and RL on generalization and memorization, focusing on text-based rule variants and visual variants. We introduce GeneralPoints, an arithmetic reasoning card game, and adopt V-IRL, a real-world navigation environment, to assess how models trained with SFT and RL generalize to unseen variants in both textual and visual domains. We show that RL, especially when trained with an outcome-based reward, generalizes across both rule-based textual and visual variants. SFT, in contrast, tends to memorize training data and struggles to generalize out-of-distribution scenarios. Further analysis reveals that RL improves the model's underlying visual recognition capabilities, contributing to its enhanced generalization in the visual domain. Despite RL's superior generalization, we show that SFT remains essential for effective RL training; SFT stabilizes the model's output format, enabling subsequent RL to achieve its performance gains. These findings demonstrates the capability of RL for acquiring generalizable knowledge in complex, multi-modal tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website at https://tianzhechu.com/SFTvsRL</p></details> |

In this work, we propose SOAEsV2-7B/72B, a specialized LLM series developed via a three-phase framework: 1) continual pre-training integrates domain knowledge while retaining base capabilities; 2) domain-progressive SFT employs curriculum-based learning strategy, transitioning from weakly relevant conversational data to expert-annotated SOAEs datasets to optimize domain-specific tasks; 3) distillation-enhanced speculative decoding accelerates inference via logit distillation between 72B target and 7B draft models, achieving 1.39-1.52$\times$ speedup without quality loss. Experimental results demonstrate that our domain-specific pre-training phase maintains 99.8% of original general language capabilities while significantly improving domain performance, resulting in a 1.08$\times$ improvement in Rouge-1 score and a 1.17$\times$ enhancement in BLEU-4 score. Ablation studies further show that domain-progressive SFT outperforms single-stage training, achieving 1.02$\times$ improvement in Rouge-1 and 1.06$\times$ in BLEU-4. Our work introduces a comprehensive, full-pipeline approach for optimizing SOAEs LLMs, bridging the gap between general language capabilities and domain-specific expertise.</p></details> |  |

With the rapid scaling of Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly through reinforcement learning (RL), there is a growing need for more capable discriminators. Consequently, advances in classification are becoming increasingly vital for enhancing the overall capabilities of LLMs. Traditional discriminative methods map text to labels but overlook LLMs' intrinsic generative strengths. Generative classification addresses this by prompting the model to directly output labels. However, existing studies still rely on simple SFT alone, seldom probing the interplay between training and inference prompts, and no work has systematically leveraged RL for generative text classifiers and unified SFT, RL, and inference-time prompting in one framework. We bridge this gap with GenCLS++, a framework that jointly optimizes SFT and RL while systematically exploring five high-level strategy dimensions-in-context learning variants, category definitions, explicit uncertainty labels, semantically irrelevant numeric labels, and perplexity-based decoding-during both training and inference. After an SFT "policy warm-up," we apply RL with a simple rule-based reward, yielding sizable extra gains. Across seven datasets, GenCLS++ achieves an average accuracy improvement of 3.46% relative to the naive SFT baseline; on public datasets, this improvement rises to 4.00%. Notably, unlike reasoning-intensive tasks that benefit from explicit thinking processes, we find that classification tasks perform better without such reasoning steps. These insights into the role of explicit reasoning provide valuable guidance for future LLM applications.</p></details> |  |

However, the specific capabilities enhanced through such fine-tuning remain poorly understood. In this paper, we conduct a detailed analysis of model performance on the AIME24 dataset to understand how reasoning capabilities evolve. We discover a ladder-like structure in problem difficulty, categorize questions into four tiers (Easy, Medium, Hard, and Extremely Hard (Exh)), and identify the specific requirements for advancing between tiers. We find that progression from Easy to Medium tier requires adopting an R1 reasoning style with minimal SFT (500-1K instances), while Hard-level questions suffer from frequent model's errors at each step of the reasoning chain, with accuracy plateauing at around 65% despite logarithmic scaling. Exh-level questions present a fundamentally different challenge; they require unconventional problem-solving skills that current models uniformly struggle with. Additional findings reveal that carefully curated small-scale datasets offer limited advantage-scaling dataset size proves far more effective. Our analysis provides a clearer roadmap for advancing language model capabilities in mathematical reasoning.</p></details> |  |

An Early Investigation into Training R1-Like Reasoning Large Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11468v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work revisits the dominant supervised fine-tuning (SFT) then reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm for training Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), and reveals a key finding: SFT can significantly undermine subsequent RL by inducing ``pseudo reasoning paths'' imitated from expert models. While these paths may resemble the native reasoning paths of RL models, they often involve prolonged, hesitant, less informative steps, and incorrect reasoning. To systematically study this effect, we introduce VLAA-Thinking, a new multimodal dataset designed to support reasoning in LVLMs. Constructed via a six-step pipeline involving captioning, reasoning distillation, answer rewrite and verification, VLAA-Thinking comprises high-quality, step-by-step visual reasoning traces for SFT, along with a more challenging RL split from the same data source. Using this dataset, we conduct extensive experiments comparing SFT, RL and their combinations. Results show that while SFT helps models learn reasoning formats, it often locks aligned models into imitative, rigid reasoning modes that impede further learning. In contrast, building on the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a novel mixed reward module integrating both perception and cognition signals, our RL approach fosters more genuine, adaptive reasoning behavior. Notably, our model VLAA-Thinker, based on Qwen2.5VL 3B, achieves top-1 performance on Open LMM Reasoning Leaderboard (https://huggingface.co/spaces/opencompass/Open_LMM_Reasoning_Leaderboard) among 4B scale LVLMs, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art by 1.8%. We hope our findings provide valuable insights in developing reasoning-capable LVLMs and can inform future research in this area.</p></details> |  |

However, to enhance its utility and reduce potential harm, SFT and alignment are applied sequentially to the pretrained model. Due to the differing nature and objective functions of SFT and alignment, catastrophic forgetting has become a significant issue. To address this, we introduce Unified Fine-Tuning (UFT), which integrates SFT and alignment into a single training stage using the same objective and loss functions through an implicit reward function. Our experimental results demonstrate that UFT outperforms SFT on instruction-tuning data alone. Moreover, when combining instruction-tuning data with alignment data, UFT effectively prevents catastrophic forgetting across these two stages and shows a clear advantage over sequentially applying SFT and alignment. This is evident in the significant improvements observed in the \textbf{ifeval} task for instruction-following and the \textbf{truthful-qa} task for factuality. The proposed general fine-tuning framework UFT establishes an effective and efficient pretraining-UFT paradigm for LLM training.</p></details> |  |

However, existing approaches struggle with temporal reasoning due to weak temporal correspondence in the data and reliance on the next-token prediction paradigm during training. To address these limitations, we propose TEMPLE (TEMporal Preference Learning), a systematic framework that enhances Video LLMs' temporal reasoning capabilities through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). To facilitate this, we introduce an automated preference data generation pipeline that systematically constructs preference pairs by selecting videos that are rich in temporal information, designing video-specific perturbation strategies, and finally evaluating model responses on clean and perturbed video inputs. Our temporal alignment features two key innovations: curriculum learning which that progressively increases perturbation difficulty to improve model robustness and adaptability; and "Pre-SFT Alignment'', applying preference optimization before instruction tuning to prioritize fine-grained temporal comprehension. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently improves Video LLM performance across multiple benchmarks with a relatively small set of self-generated DPO data. We further analyze the transferability of DPO data across architectures and the role of difficulty scheduling in optimization. Our findings highlight our TEMPLE as a scalable and efficient complement to SFT-based methods, paving the way for developing reliable Video LLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/lscpku/TEMPLE.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bring Remote Sensing Object Detect Into Nature Language Model: Using SFT Method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08144v2)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved significant success, demonstrating remarkable capabilities in understanding various images and videos, particularly in classification and detection tasks. However, due to the substantial differences between remote sensing images and conventional optical images, these models face considerable challenges in comprehension, especially in detection tasks. Directly prompting VLMs with detection instructions often leads to unsatisfactory results. To address this issue, this letter explores the application of VLMs for object detection in remote sensing images. Specifically, we constructed supervised fine-tuning (SFT) datasets using publicly available remote sensing object detection datasets, including SSDD, HRSID, and NWPU-VHR-10. In these new datasets, we converted annotation information into JSON-compliant natural language descriptions, facilitating more effective understanding and training for the VLM. We then evaluate the detection performance of various fine-tuning strategies for VLMs and derive optimized model weights for object detection in remote sensing images. Finally, we evaluate the model's prior knowledge capabilities using natural language queries. Experimental results demonstrate that, without modifying the model architecture, remote sensing object detection can be effectively achieved using natural language alone. Additionally, the model exhibits the ability to perform certain vision question answering (VQA) tasks. Our datasets and related code will be released soon.</p></details> |  |

However, attempts to extend this success to multimodal reasoning often failed to reproduce these key characteristics. In this report, we present the first successful replication of these emergent characteristics for multimodal reasoning on only a non-SFT 2B model. Starting with Qwen2-VL-2B and applying reinforcement learning directly on the SAT dataset, our model achieves 59.47% accuracy on CVBench, outperforming the base model by approximately ~30% and exceeding both SFT setting by ~2%. In addition, we share our failed attempts and insights in attempting to achieve R1-like reasoning using RL with instruct models. aiming to shed light on the challenges involved. Our key observations include: (1) applying RL on instruct model often results in trivial reasoning trajectories, and (2) naive length reward are ineffective in eliciting reasoning capabilities.

However, RLHF has been continuously challenged by its high complexity in implementation and computation consumption. Even with recent simplifications, such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Advantage Leftover Lunch (A-LoL), the problems of over-fitting and training instability remain hindering the alignment process from the expected optimal performance. To address the existing challenges, we propose a novel simplification of RLHF from the perspective of variational inference, called $\textbf{V}$ariational $\textbf{A}$lignment with $\textbf{R}$e-weighting ($\textbf{VAR}$). More specifically, by directly minimizing the distribution gap between the learning LLM policy and the optimal solution of RLHF, we transform the alignment objective into a reward-driven re-weighted supervised fine-tuning (SFT) form, which only requires minor adjustment on the SFT loss to obtain noticeable improvement on training stability and effectiveness. On comprehensive alignment and generation benchmarks, our VAR method has numerically achieved competitive performance in LLM alignment helpfulness and harmlessness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Provably Mitigating Overoptimization in RLHF: Your SFT Loss is Implicitly an Adversarial Regularizer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16436v3)** | 2024-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aligning generative models with human preference via RLHF typically suffers from overoptimization, where an imperfectly learned reward model can misguide the generative model to output undesired responses. We investigate this problem in a principled manner by identifying the source of the misalignment as a form of distributional shift and uncertainty in learning human preferences. To mitigate overoptimization, we first propose a theoretical algorithm that chooses the best policy for an adversarially chosen reward model; one that simultaneously minimizes the maximum likelihood estimation of the loss and a reward penalty term. Here, the reward penalty term is introduced to prevent the policy from choosing actions with spurious high proxy rewards, resulting in provable sample efficiency of the algorithm under a partial coverage style condition. Moving from theory to practice, the proposed algorithm further enjoys an equivalent but surprisingly easy-to-implement reformulation. Using the equivalence between reward models and the corresponding optimal policy, the algorithm features a simple objective that combines: (i) a preference optimization loss that directly aligns the policy with human preference, and (ii) a supervised learning loss that explicitly imitates the policy with a (suitable) baseline distribution. In the context of aligning large language models (LLM), this objective fuses the direct preference optimization (DPO) loss with the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) loss to help mitigate the overoptimization towards undesired responses, for which we name the algorithm Regularized Preference Optimization (RPO). Experiments of aligning LLMs demonstrate the improved performance of RPO compared with DPO baselines. Our work sheds light on the interplay between preference optimization and SFT in tuning LLMs with both theoretical guarantees and empirical evidence.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by The Thirty-Eighth Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems. 31 pages, 7 figures</p></details> |
| **[Continual SFT Matches Multimodal RLHF with Negative Supervision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14797v1)** | 2024-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal RLHF usually happens after supervised finetuning (SFT) stage to continually improve vision-language models' (VLMs) comprehension. Conventional wisdom holds its superiority over continual SFT during this preference alignment stage. In this paper, we observe that the inherent value of multimodal RLHF lies in its negative supervision, the logit of the rejected responses. We thus propose a novel negative supervised finetuning (nSFT) approach that fully excavates these information resided. Our nSFT disentangles this negative supervision in RLHF paradigm, and continually aligns VLMs with a simple SFT loss. This is more memory efficient than multimodal RLHF where 2 (e.g., DPO) or 4 (e.g., PPO) large VLMs are strictly required. The effectiveness of nSFT is rigorously proved by comparing it with various multimodal RLHF approaches, across different dataset sources, base VLMs and evaluation metrics. Besides, fruitful of ablations are provided to support our hypothesis. We hope this paper will stimulate further research to properly align large vision language models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Getting More Juice Out of the SFT Data: Reward Learning from Human Demonstration Improves SFT for LLM Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17888v3)** | 2024-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aligning human preference and value is an important requirement for contemporary foundation models. State-of-the-art techniques such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) often consist of two stages: 1) supervised fine-tuning (SFT), where the model is fine-tuned by learning from human demonstration data; 2) Preference learning, where preference data is used to learn a reward model, which is in turn used by a reinforcement learning (RL) step to fine-tune the model. Such reward model serves as a proxy to human preference, and it is critical to guide the RL step towards improving the model quality. In this work, we argue that the SFT stage significantly benefits from learning a reward model as well. Instead of using the human demonstration data directly via supervised learning, we propose to leverage an Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) technique to simultaneously build an reward model and a policy model. This approach leads to new SFT algorithms that are not only efficient to implement, but are robust to the presence of low-quality supervised learning data. Moreover, we discover a connection between the proposed IRL based approach, and a recent line of works called Self-Play Fine-tune (SPIN). Theoretically, we show that the proposed algorithms converge to the stationary solutions of the IRL problem. Empirically, we align 1B and 7B models using proposed methods and evaluate them on a reward benchmark model and the HuggingFace Open LLM Leaderboard. The proposed methods show significant performance improvement over existing SFT approaches. Our results indicate that it is beneficial to leverage reward learning throughout the entire alignment process.</p></details> |  |

Comparing to SFT, there are many efforts focused on RLHF and several algorithms being proposed, such as PPO, DPO, IPO, KTO, MinorDPO and etc. Meanwhile most efforts for SFT are focused on how to collect, filter and mix high quality data. In this article with insight from DPO and MinorDPO, we propose a training metric for SFT to measure the discrepancy between the optimized model and the original model, and a loss function MinorSFT that can increase the training effectiveness, and reduce the discrepancy between the optimized LLM and original LLM.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |

However, sourcing this data through human annotation is costly, and existing automated methods often fail to capture the diverse range of contextual granularity and tend to produce homogeneous data. To tackle these issues, we introduce a novel method named AugCon, capable of automatically generating context-driven SFT data across multiple levels of granularity with high diversity, quality and fidelity. AugCon begins by generating queries using the Context-Split-Tree (CST), an innovative approach for recursively deriving queries and splitting context to cover full granularity. Then, we train a scorer through contrastive learning to collaborate with CST to rank and refine queries. Finally, a synergistic integration of self-alignment and self-improving is introduced to obtain high-fidelity responses. Extensive experiments are conducted incorporating both human and automatic evaluations, encompassing a test scenario and four widely-used benchmarks in English and Chinese.

It typically consists of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) stages. However, RLHF faces inherent limitations stemming from a complex training setup and its tendency to align the model with implicit values that end users cannot control at run-time. Moreover, reward models in RLHF stage commonly rely on single-dimensional feedback as opposed to explicit, multifaceted signals that indicate attributes such as helpfulness, humor, and toxicity. To address these limitations, we propose SteerLM, a supervised fine-tuning method that empowers end-users to control responses during inference. SteerLM conditions responses to conform to an explicitly defined multi-dimensional set of attributes, thereby empowering a steerable AI capable of generating helpful and high-quality responses while maintaining customizability. Experiments show that SteerLM trained on open source datasets generates responses that are preferred by human and automatic evaluators to many state-of-the-art baselines trained with RLHF while being much easier to train.

However, as the number of cascades increases, the improvements in reconstruction tend to become marginal, indicating possible excess model capacity. Knowledge distillation (KD) is an emerging technique to compress these models, in which a trained deep teacher network is used to distill knowledge to a smaller student network such that the student learns to mimic the behavior of the teacher. Most KD methods focus on effectively training the student with a pre-trained teacher unaware of the student model. We propose SFT-KD-Recon, a student-friendly teacher training approach along with the student as a prior step to KD to make the teacher aware of the structure and capacity of the student and enable aligning the representations of the teacher with the student. In SFT, the teacher is jointly trained with the unfolded branch configurations of the student blocks using three loss terms - teacher-reconstruction loss, student-reconstruction loss, and teacher-student imitation loss, followed by KD of the student. We perform extensive experiments for MRI acceleration in 4x and 5x under-sampling on the brain and cardiac datasets on five KD methods using the proposed approach as a prior step. We consider the DC-CNN architecture and setup teacher as D5C5 (141765 parameters), and student as D3C5 (49285 parameters), denoting a compression of 2.87:1. Results show that (i) our approach consistently improves the KD methods with improved reconstruction performance and image quality, and (ii) the student distilled using our approach is competitive with the teacher, with the performance gap reduced from 0.53 dB to 0.03 dB.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 8 figures.

In particular we prove that all generalized Baumslag-Solitar groups (GBS) admit a strongly aperiodic SFT. Our proof is based on a structural theorem by Whyte and on two constructions of strongly aperiodic SFTs on $\mathbb{F}_n\times \mathbb{Z}$ and $BS(m,n)$ of our own. Our two constructions rely on a path-folding technique that lifts an SFT on $\mathbb{Z}^2$ inside an SFT on $\mathbb{F}_n\times \mathbb{Z}$ or an SFT on the hyperbolic plane inside an SFT on $BS(m,n)$. In the case of $\mathbb{F}_n\times \mathbb{Z}$ the path folding technique also preserves minimality, so that we get minimal strongly aperiodic SFTs on unimodular GBS groups.</p></details> | 31 pages, 13 figures |

As a consequence, if $P$ contains a recursive member, $P$ and $X$ have the exact same set of Turing degrees. On the other hand, we prove that if $X$ contains only non-recursive members, some of its members always have different but comparable degrees. This gives a fairly complete study of Turing degrees of SFTs.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1102.1189</p></details> |

| **[Failure Modes of Maximum Entropy RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20265v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we show that Simple Preference Optimization (SimPO) can be derived as Maximum Entropy Reinforcement Learning with length-normalized temperature, providing a theoretical foundation for this reference-free method. Motivated by SimPO's strong performance in offline preference optimization, we investigate whether Maximum Entropy RL can achieve similar results in online RLHF settings. Our experiments find that Maximum Entropy RL consistently exhibits overoptimization and unstable KL dynamics, even at very low learning rates. Unlike KL-constrained methods that maintain stable training, entropy regularization fails to prevent reward hacking and appears to correlate with overoptimization. Lastly, we discuss possible explanations for why SimPO succeeds in offline settings while Maximum Entropy RL struggles in online scenarios. Our findings suggest that reference-free approaches may face distinct challenges when applied to online or offline preference learning.</p></details> | 26 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Opal: An Operator Algebra View of RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11298v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Opal, an operator view of reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Objectives are expressed as ladders of two primitives on a base utility: additive penalties and multiplicative pairwise weights. We describe a simple reduction law with if-and-only-if conditions: such ladders collapse to a normal form on pairwise margins when the reference is fixed, penalties are additive, and weights are independent of intermediate margins. When these assumptions do not hold (reference shift, non-additive gates, score-dependent weights), small examples demonstrate non-reducibility. Building on this view, we introduce GKPO (Generalized Kernel Preference Object), a canonical schema in which many RLHF methods can be represented and, when reducible, mapped back from. GKPO provides a standard JSON serialization, canonicalization and hashing rules, and explicit flags with finite witnesses when assumptions fail. We illustrate these ideas with GKPO examples for DPO, RRHF, and ORPO, along with cross-method conversions (where assumptions permit) and minimal stress tests (SHIFT/GATE/SCORE) that highlight non-reducibility. A lightweight Python reference library accompanies the schema, implementing canonical hashing and adapters for DPO and RRHF.</p></details> | 11 pages main |

The state-of-the-art, MaxMin-RLHF, addresses this by learning group-specific reward models, and by optimizing for the group receiving the minimum reward, thereby promoting fairness. However, we identify that a key limitation of MaxMin-RLHF is its poor performance when the minimum-reward group is a minority. To mitigate this drawback, we introduce a novel framework, termed {\em SharedRep-RLHF}. At its core, SharedRep-RLHF learns and leverages {\em shared traits} in annotations among various groups, in contrast to learning separate reward models across groups. We first show that MaxMin-RLHF is provably suboptimal in learning shared traits, and then quantify the sample complexity of SharedRep-RLHF. Experiments across diverse natural language tasks showcase the effectiveness of SharedRep-RLHF compared to MaxMin-RLHF with a gain of up to 20% in win rate.</p></details> |  |
| **[Balanced Actor Initialization: Stable RLHF Training of Distillation-Based Reasoning Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00309v1)** | 2025-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of alignment and reasoning capabilities in large language models has seen remarkable progress through two paradigms: instruction tuning and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) alignment paradigm, and distillation-based reasoning fine-tuning paradigm. While both approaches prove effective independently, the third paradigm of applying RLHF to distillation-trained models presents significant challenges. Our investigation reveals two critical phenomena that emerge in this paradigm: Sequence Length Collapse, where language generation dramatically reduces during early RLHF training, and the Reward Hockey Stick Curve, featuring severe reward score drops followed by gradual recovery. These instabilities fundamentally compromise the model's alignment and reasoning capabilities. To address these challenges, we propose Balanced Actor Initialization (BAI), a two-stage weighted model merging approach. BAI first merges instruction-following and distillation-based reasoning fine-tuned models, then further combines this intermediate model with the pretrained model to preserve foundational knowledge. Through comprehensive experiments across diverse benchmarks and detailed analysis of training experiments, we demonstrate that BAI resolves Sequence Length Collapse, mitigates the Reward Hockey Stick Curve, and enables continuous sequence length improvement during training. Additionally, our analysis reveals that balanced merging ratios achieve optimal trade-offs between training stability and reasoning capability preservation. Our work provides the effective solution for stable training in this third paradigm, enabling more capable reasoning models that combine distillation efficiency with RLHF alignment.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Algorithmic Bias of Aligning Large Language Models with RLHF: Preference Collapse and Matching Regularization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16455v2)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences is crucial for informing fair, economically sound, and statistically efficient decision-making processes. However, we argue that the predominant approach for aligning LLMs with human preferences through a reward model -- reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) -- suffers from an inherent algorithmic bias due to its Kullback--Leibler-based regularization in optimization. In extreme cases, this bias could lead to a phenomenon we term preference collapse, where minority preferences are virtually disregarded. To mitigate this algorithmic bias, we introduce preference matching (PM) RLHF, a novel approach that provably aligns LLMs with the preference distribution of the reward model under the Bradley--Terry--Luce/Plackett--Luce model. Central to our approach is a PM regularizer that takes the form of the negative logarithm of the LLM's policy probability distribution over responses, which helps the LLM balance response diversification and reward maximization. Notably, we obtain this regularizer by solving an ordinary differential equation that is necessary for the PM property. For practical implementation, we introduce a conditional variant of PM RLHF that is tailored to natural language generation. Finally, we empirically validate the effectiveness of conditional PM RLHF through experiments on the OPT and Llama-family models, demonstrating a 29% to 41% improvement in alignment with human preferences, as measured by a certain metric, compared to standard RLHF.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the Journal of the American Statistical Association</p></details> |
| **[KL-Regularised Q-Learning: A Token-level Action-Value perspective on Online RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17000v1)** | 2025-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) is an established and effective policy gradient algorithm used for Language Model Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (LM-RLHF). PPO performs well empirically but has a heuristic motivation and handles the KL-divergence constraint used in LM-RLHF in an ad-hoc manner. In this paper, we develop a a new action-value RL method for the LM-RLHF setting, KL-regularised Q-Learning (KLQ). We then show that our method is equivalent to a version of PPO in a certain specific sense, despite its very different motivation. Finally, we benchmark KLQ on two key language generation tasks -- summarisation and single-turn dialogue. We demonstrate that KLQ performs on-par with PPO at optimising the LM-RLHF objective, and achieves a consistently higher win-rate against PPO on LLM-as-a-judge evaluations.</p></details> |  |
| **[RLHF Fine-Tuning of LLMs for Alignment with Implicit User Feedback in Conversational Recommenders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05289v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conversational recommender systems (CRS) based on Large Language Models (LLMs) need to constantly be aligned to the user preferences to provide satisfying and context-relevant item recommendations. The traditional supervised fine-tuning cannot capture the implicit feedback signal, e.g., dwell time, sentiment polarity, or engagement patterns. In this paper, we share a fine-tuning solution using human feedback reinforcement learning (RLHF) to maximize implied user feedback (IUF) in a multi-turn recommendation context. We specify a reward model $R_{\phi}$ learnt on weakly-labelled engagement information and maximize user-centric utility by optimizing the foundational LLM M_{\theta} through a proximal policy optimization (PPO) approach. The architecture models conversational state transitions $s_t \to a_t \to s_{t +1}$, where the action $a_t$ is associated with LLM-generated item suggestions only on condition of conversation history in the past. The evaluation across synthetic and real-world datasets (e.g.REDIAL, OpenDialKG) demonstrates that our RLHF-fine-tuned models can perform better in terms of top-$k$ recommendation accuracy, coherence, and user satisfaction compared to (arrow-zero-cmwrquca-teja-falset ensuite 2Round group-deca States penalty give up This paper shows that implicit signal alignment can be efficient in achieving scalable and user-adaptive design of CRS.</p></details> |  |
| **[REINFORCE++: An Efficient RLHF Algorithm with Robustness to Both Prompt and Reward Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03262v8)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) plays a crucial role in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values and preferences. While state-of-the-art applications like ChatGPT or GPT-4 commonly employ Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), the inclusion of a critic network introduces significant computational overhead. REINFORCE-based methods, such as REINFORCE Leave One-Out (RLOO), ReMax, and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), address this limitation by eliminating the critic network. However, these approaches face challenges in accurate advantage estimation. Specifically, they estimate advantages independently for responses to each prompt, which can lead to overfitting on simpler prompts and vulnerability to reward hacking and may be biased. To address these challenges, we introduce REINFORCE++, a novel approach that removes the critic model while using the global advantage normalization which is unbiased to improve the training stability. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that REINFORCE++ exhibits robust performance across various reward models without requiring prompt set truncation. Furthermore, it achieves superior generalization in both RLHF and long chain-of-thought (CoT) settings compared to existing REINFORCE-based methods. The implementation is available at https://github.com/OpenRLHF/OpenRLHF.</p></details> | add experiments |

While existing RLHF training systems have enabled significant progress, they often face challenges in scaling to multi-modal and diffusion workflows and adapting to dynamic workloads. In particular, current approaches may encounter limitations in controller scalability, flexible resource placement, and efficient orchestration when handling complex RLHF pipelines, especially in scenarios involving dynamic sampling or generative reward modeling. In this paper, we present \textbf{G-Core}, a simple, scalable, and balanced RLHF training framework designed to address these challenges. G-Core introduces a parallel controller programming model, enabling flexible and efficient orchestration of complex RLHF workflows without the bottlenecks of a single centralized controller. Furthermore, we propose a dynamic placement schema that adaptively partitions resources and schedules workloads, significantly reducing hardware idle time and improving utilization, even under highly variable training conditions. G-Core has successfully trained models that support WeChat product features serving a large-scale user base, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness in real-world scenarios. Our results show that G-Core advances the state of the art in RLHF training, providing a solid foundation for future research and deployment of large-scale, human-aligned models.</p></details> | <details><summary>I hav...</summary><p>I haven't received company approval yet, and I uploaded it by mistake</p></details> |
| **[Harnessing RLHF for Robust Unanswerability Recognition and Trustworthy Response Generation in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16951v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conversational Information Retrieval (CIR) systems, while offering intuitive access to information, face a significant challenge: reliably handling unanswerable questions to prevent the generation of misleading or hallucinated content. Traditional approaches often rely on external classifiers, which can introduce inconsistencies with the core generative Large Language Models (LLMs). This paper introduces Self-Aware LLM for Unanswerability (SALU), a novel approach that deeply integrates unanswerability detection directly within the LLM's generative process. SALU is trained using a multi-task learning framework for both standard Question Answering (QA) and explicit abstention generation for unanswerable queries. Crucially, it incorporates a confidence-score-guided reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) phase, which explicitly penalizes hallucinated responses and rewards appropriate abstentions, fostering intrinsic self-awareness of knowledge boundaries. Through extensive experiments on our custom-built C-IR_Answerability dataset, SALU consistently outperforms strong baselines, including hybrid LLM-classifier systems, in overall accuracy for correctly answering or abstaining from questions. Human evaluation further confirms SALU's superior reliability, achieving high scores in factuality, appropriate abstention, and, most importantly, a dramatic reduction in hallucination, demonstrating its ability to robustly "know when to say 'I don't know'."</p></details> |  |

We explore two approaches that leverage human gaze modeling to enhance RLHF: (1) gaze-aware reward models and (2) gaze-based distribution of sparse rewards at token level. Our experiments demonstate that gaze-informed RLHF achieves faster convergence while maintaining or slightly improving performance, thus, reducing computational costs during policy optimization. These results show that human gaze provides a valuable and underused signal for policy optimization, pointing to a promising direction for improving RLHF efficiency.</p></details> |  |

However, existing RLHF (or RLVR) frameworks commonly face challenges such as inference bottlenecks and complexity barriers, restricting their accessibility for newcomers. To bridge this gap, we introduce OpenRLHF, a user-friendly, scalable, and easy-to-learn open-source RLHF framework built upon Ray, vLLM, DeepSpeed, and HuggingFace Transformers, featuring a simplified design, clear code structure, and comprehensive documentation to facilitate entry for researchers and practitioners. Experimental results show that OpenRLHF achieves superior training efficiency with speedups ranging from 1.22x to 1.68x across different model sizes compared to state-of-the-art frameworks, while requiring significantly fewer lines of code for implementation. OpenRLHF is publicly available at https://github.com/OpenRLHF/OpenRLHF, and has already been adopted by leading institutions to accelerate RLHF research and learning.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing RLHF approaches (e.g., PPO, DPO) still rely on a binary-preference (BT) paradigm, which, while reducing annotation costs, still requires substantial human effort and captures only group-level tendencies rather than individual preferences. To overcome these limitations, we propose Adaptive Reward-Following (ARF), a self-assessment framework that leverages a high-precision emotion analyzer achieving over 70% accuracy on GoEmotions, Sentiment140, and DailyDialog to convert free-form user feedback into continuous preference scores. We further enrich and debias these signals through lightweight data augmentations, including synonym replacement, random trace truncation, and score bias annotation algorithm. A Dynamic Adapter Preference Tracker continuously models evolving user tastes in real time, enabling our novel Trace Bias (TB) fine-tuning algorithm to optimize directly on these tracked rewards instead of coarse binary labels. Experiments on Qwen-2/2.5, Gemma-2, and Llama-3.2 across four preference domains demonstrate that ARF achieves an improvement of 3.3% over PPO and 7.6% over DPO. Moreover, TB preserves theoretical alignment with PPO and DPO objectives. Overall, ARF presents a scalable, personalized, and cost-effective approach to RLHF LLMs through autonomous reward modeling.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint under review</p></details> |
| **[The Hidden Link Between RLHF and Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22578v1)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human values has recently garnered significant attention, with prominent examples including the canonical yet costly Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and the simple Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). In this work, we demonstrate that both RLHF and DPO can be interpreted from the perspective of mutual information (MI) maximization, uncovering a profound connection to contrastive learning. Within this framework, both RLHF and DPO can be viewed as methods that perform contrastive learning based on the positive and negative samples derived from the base model, leveraging the Donsker-Varadhan (DV) lower bound on MI (equivalently, the MINE estimator). This paradigm further explains why RLHF may not intrinsically incentivize reasoning capacities in LLMs beyond what is already present in the base model. Building on this perspective, we replace the DV/MINE bound with the Jensen-Shannon MI estimator and propose Mutual Information Optimization (MIO). Comprehensive theoretical analysis and extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that MIO mitigates the late-stage decline in chosen-likelihood observed in DPO, achieving competitive or superior performance across various challenging reasoning and mathematical benchmarks. We will release the model and code upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |

Traditional RLHF approaches rely on a fixed dataset, which often suffers from limited coverage. To this end, online RLHF has emerged as a promising direction, enabling iterative data collection and model improvement. Despite its potential, this paradigm faces a key bottleneck: the requirement to continuously integrate new data into the historical dataset and re-optimize the model from scratch at each iteration, resulting in computational and storage costs that grow linearly with the number of iterations. In this work, we address this challenge by proposing a one-pass reward modeling method that does not require storing the historical data and can be computed in constant time. Specifically, we first formalize RLHF as a contextual preference bandit problem and design an online mirror descent algorithm with a tailored local norm to replace the standard maximum likelihood estimation for reward modeling. We then apply our method to various online RLHF settings, including passive data collection, active data collection, and deployment-time adaptation. We provide theoretical guarantees showing that our method improves both statistical and computational efficiency. Finally, we provide practical algorithms and conduct experiments using Llama-3-8B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct models on the Ultrafeedback-binarized and Mixture2 datasets, validating the effectiveness of our proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first two authors contributed equally</p></details> |
| **[Accelerating RLHF Training with Reward Variance Increase](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23247v2)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is an essential technique for ensuring that large language models (LLMs) are aligned with human values and preferences during the post-training phase. As an effective RLHF approach, group relative policy optimization (GRPO) has demonstrated success in many LLM-based applications. However, efficient GRPO-based RLHF training remains a challenge. Recent studies reveal that a higher reward variance of the initial policy model leads to faster RLHF training. Inspired by this finding, we propose a practical reward adjustment model to accelerate RLHF training by provably increasing the reward variance and preserving the relative preferences and reward expectation. Our reward adjustment method inherently poses a nonconvex optimization problem, which is NP-hard to solve in general. To overcome the computational challenges, we design a novel $O(n \log n)$ algorithm to find a global solution of the nonconvex reward adjustment model by explicitly characterizing the extreme points of the feasible set. As an important application, we naturally integrate this reward adjustment model into the GRPO algorithm, leading to a more efficient GRPO with reward variance increase (GRPOVI) algorithm for RLHF training. As an interesting byproduct, we provide an indirect explanation for the empirical effectiveness of GRPO with rule-based reward for RLHF training, as demonstrated in DeepSeek-R1. Experiment results demonstrate that the GRPOVI algorithm can significantly improve the RLHF training efficiency compared to the original GRPO algorithm.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reward Shaping to Mitigate Reward Hacking in RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18770v3)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is essential for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values. However, RLHF is susceptible to \emph{reward hacking}, where the agent exploits flaws in the reward function rather than learning the intended behavior, thus degrading alignment. Although reward shaping helps stabilize RLHF and partially mitigate reward hacking, a systematic investigation into shaping techniques and their underlying principles remains lacking. To bridge this gap, we present a comprehensive study of the prevalent reward shaping methods. Our analysis suggests two key design principles: (1) the RL reward should be bounded, and (2) the RL reward benefits from rapid initial growth followed by gradual convergence. Guided by these insights, we propose Preference As Reward (PAR), a novel approach that leverages the latent preferences embedded within the reward model as the signal for reinforcement learning. We evaluated PAR on two base models, Gemma2-2B, and Llama3-8B, using two datasets, Ultrafeedback-Binarized and HH-RLHF. Experimental results demonstrate PAR's superior performance over other reward shaping methods. On the AlpacaEval 2.0 benchmark, PAR achieves a win rate of at least 5 percentage points higher than competing approaches. Furthermore, PAR exhibits remarkable data efficiency, requiring only a single reference reward for optimal performance, and maintains robustness against reward hacking even after two full epochs of training. The code is available at https://github.com/PorUna-byte/PAR, and the Work done during the internship at StepFun by Jiayi Fu.</p></details> | 24 pages |
| **[Theoretical Tensions in RLHF: Reconciling Empirical Success with Inconsistencies in Social Choice Theory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12350v1)** | 2025-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite its empirical success, Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has been shown to violate almost all the fundamental axioms in social choice theory -- such as majority consistency, pairwise majority consistency, and Condorcet consistency. This raises a foundational question: why does RLHF perform so well in practice if it fails these seemingly essential properties? In this paper, we resolve this paradox by showing that under mild and empirically plausible assumptions on the preference profile, RLHF does satisfy pairwise majority and Condorcet consistency. These assumptions are frequently satisfied in real-world alignment tasks, offering a theoretical explanation for RLHF's strong practical performance. Furthermore, we show that a slight modification to the reward modeling objective can ensure pairwise majority or Condorcet consistency even under general preference profiles, thereby improving the alignment process. Finally, we go beyond classical axioms in economic and social choice theory and introduce new alignment criteria -- preference matching, preference equivalence, and group preference matching -- that better reflect the goal of learning distributions over responses. We show that while RLHF satisfies the first two properties, it fails to satisfy the third. We conclude by discussing how future alignment methods may be designed to satisfy all three.</p></details> |  |
| **[RLHS: Mitigating Misalignment in RLHF with Hindsight Simulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08617v3)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has shown promise in aligning generative AI, we present empirical evidence that it can also cause severe, systematic misalignment. We hypothesize that this stems from evaluator feedback depending on downstream outcome predictions (foresight) that can be influenced by the AI's output, inducing Goodhart's law dynamics. We present a theoretical analysis showing that conditioning evaluator feedback on downstream observations (hindsight) inhibits this effect by decoupling the alignment signal from potentially compromised predictions--crucially, the result holds even if the observed outcomes are sampled from the AI's own world model. Building on this insight, we introduce Reinforcement Learning from Hindsight Simulation (RLHS), which presents plausible simulated outcomes to evaluators before eliciting feedback. We validate RLHS across three consultancy settings--marketplace interactions, restaurant recommendations, and online course advising--using both online (PPO) and offline (DPO) fine-tuning methods, and show that it substantially improves alignment over RLHF in experiments and human evaluations. We perform post-hoc benchmark evaluations on TruthfulQA, HaluEval, and TrustLLM, finding that even after single-task fine-tuning, RLHF misalignment persists, whereas RLHS consistently outperforms baselines and demonstrates robust alignment generalization.

| **[Active Preference Optimization for Sample Efficient RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10500v3)** | 2025-06-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) aligned using Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) have shown remarkable generation abilities in numerous tasks. However, collecting high-quality human preferences creates costly bottlenecks in practical deployments, and hence, training data are often budgeted. In these scenarios, it is crucial to collect training data (e.g., contexts, a pair of generations for each context, and a preference indicating which generation is better) carefully, yet most of the existing methods sample contexts uniformly at random from a given collection. Given this, under the Bradley-Terry-Luce preference model and with a small budget of training data, we show that uniform sampling of contexts could lead to a policy (i.e., an aligned model) that suffers a constant sub-optimality gap from the optimal policy. This highlights the need for an adaptive context sampling strategy for effective alignment under a small sample budget. To address this, we reformulate RLHF within the contextual preference bandit framework, treating generations as actions, and give a nearly complete characterization of the sub-optimality gap in terms of both lower and upper bounds. First, when the action set is a $d$-dimensional hypercube and the number of samples is $T$, we show an $\Omega(d/\sqrt{T})$ lower bound. Next, we propose an algorithm, $\textit{Active Preference Optimization}$ ($\texttt{APO}$), that iteratively collects preferences for the most uncertain contexts. We show that the sub-optimality gap of the policy learned via $\texttt{APO}$ matches the lower bound up to a log factor and a non-linearity constant. Finally, we perform experiments on practical datasets to validate $\texttt{APO}$'s efficacy over existing methods, establishing it as a sample-efficient and cost-effective solution for LLM alignment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ECML-PKDD 2025.

| **[Policy Filtration for RLHF to Mitigate Noise in Reward Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06957v5)** | 2025-06-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While direct policy optimization methods exist, pioneering LLMs are fine-tuned with reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to generate better responses under the supervision of a reward model learned from preference data. One major challenge of RLHF is the inaccuracy of the intermediate reward model, especially in the tasks that requires complex reasoning for the reward model to score a response. We find that the reliability of the reward model varies across responses assigned with different rewards. This motivates us to filter the samples whose rewards may be unreliable to improve the signal-to-noise ratio during policy learning, resulting in Policy Filtration for Proximal Policy Optimization (PF-PPO). To choose a proper policy filtering strategy, we use the coefficient of determination (R2) between the rewards and actual scores on filtered samples as the metrics to help us find promising strategies since it measures how well the rewards filtered by PF-PPO indicate real performance. We provide extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of PF-PPO in code generation and math reasoning tasks. In code generation, PF-PPO achieves the state-of-the-art performance of 7-billion-parameter models on HumanEval (+7.9%), MBPP (+0.7%), and LeetCode Contest (+10.0%) which is a more challenging benchmark created by us. In math reasoning, PF-PPO yields performance increase using different reward models and benchmarks (Ape210K and CMATH).

Incorporating multiple reference models has the potential to address these limitations by broadening perspectives, reducing bias, and leveraging the strengths of diverse open-source LLMs. However, integrating multiple reference models into reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) frameworks poses significant theoretical challenges, where achieving exact solutions has remained an open problem. This paper presents the first \emph{exact solution} to the multiple reference model problem in reverse KL-regularized RLHF. We introduce a comprehensive theoretical framework that includes rigorous statistical analysis and provides sample complexity guarantees. Additionally, we extend our analysis to forward KL-regularized RLHF, offering new insights into sample complexity requirements in multiple reference scenarios. Our contributions lay the foundation for more advanced and adaptable LLM alignment techniques, enabling the effective use of multiple reference models. This work paves the way for developing alignment frameworks that are both theoretically sound and better suited to the challenges of modern AI ecosystems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exper...</summary><p>Experiments are added in new version</p></details> |

However, RLHF's feedback mechanism also opens new pathways for adversaries. This paper demonstrates the feasibility of hijacking T2I models by poisoning a small fraction of preference data with natural-appearing examples. Specifically, we propose BadReward, a stealthy clean-label poisoning attack targeting the reward model in multi-modal RLHF. BadReward operates by inducing feature collisions between visually contradicted preference data instances, thereby corrupting the reward model and indirectly compromising the T2I model's integrity. Unlike existing alignment poisoning techniques focused on single (text) modality, BadReward is independent of the preference annotation process, enhancing its stealth and practical threat. Extensive experiments on popular T2I models show that BadReward can consistently guide the generation towards improper outputs, such as biased or violent imagery, for targeted concepts. Our findings underscore the amplified threat landscape for RLHF in multi-modal systems, highlighting the urgent need for robust defenses. Disclaimer.

| **[The Energy Loss Phenomenon in RLHF: A New Perspective on Mitigating Reward Hacking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19358v3)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work identifies the Energy Loss Phenomenon in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and its connection to reward hacking. Specifically, energy loss in the final layer of a Large Language Model (LLM) gradually increases during the RL process, with an excessive increase in energy loss characterizing reward hacking. Beyond empirical analysis, we further provide a theoretical foundation by proving that, under mild conditions, the increased energy loss reduces the upper bound of contextual relevance in LLMs, which is a critical aspect of reward hacking as the reduced contextual relevance typically indicates overfitting to reward model-favored patterns in RL. To address this issue, we propose an Energy loss-aware PPO algorithm (EPPO) which penalizes the increase in energy loss in the LLM's final layer during reward calculation to prevent excessive energy loss, thereby mitigating reward hacking. We theoretically show that EPPO can be conceptually interpreted as an entropy-regularized RL algorithm, which provides deeper insights into its effectiveness. Extensive experiments across various LLMs and tasks demonstrate the commonality of the energy loss phenomenon, as well as the effectiveness of EPPO in mitigating reward hacking and improving RLHF performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper has been accepted by ICML 2025</p></details> |
| **[A Descriptive and Normative Theory of Human Beliefs in RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01692v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human preferences in RLHF are typically modeled as a function of the human's reward function or corresponding optimal state-action values. In this work, we propose that human beliefs about the capabilities of the agent being trained also play a key role in preference generation. We examine two questions related to this hypothesis, one descriptive and one normative, respectively: Do human labelers' beliefs about agent capabilities affect the preferences that they provide? And what is the ideal set of beliefs about an agent -- and resulting preferences -- for humans to have? We propose a new preference model that incorporates human beliefs and provide a normative theory that bounds the error on the final learned policy based on the \textit{mismatch} between the human's beliefs and an idealized set of beliefs. We then confirm via a human study that beliefs about agent capabilities do, in fact, significantly affect preferences and can be influenced through simple interventions. Additionally, we empirically show through synthetic experiments that it is often suboptimal for human preference labelers to assume agent optimality. Collectively, these results theoretically and empirically demonstrate how reducing the mismatch between human beliefs and agent capabilities can lead to more performant RLHF and point toward new best practices for RLHF practitioners.</p></details> |  |
| **[Thompson Sampling in Online RLHF with General Function Approximation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23927v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has achieved great empirical success in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preference, and it is of great importance to study the statistical efficiency of RLHF algorithms from a theoretical perspective. In this work, we consider the online RLHF setting where the preference data is revealed during the learning process and study action value function approximation. We design a model-free posterior sampling algorithm for online RLHF inspired by Thompson sampling and provide its theoretical guarantee. Specifically, we adopt Bellman eluder (BE) dimension as the complexity measure of the function class and establish $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret bound for the proposed algorithm with other multiplicative factor depending on the horizon, BE dimension and the $log$-bracketing number of the function class. Further, in the analysis, we first establish the concentration-type inequality of the squared Bellman error bound based on the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) generalization bound, which plays the crucial rules in obtaining the eluder-type regret bound and may be of independent interest.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Reward Fairness in RLHF: From a Resource Allocation Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23349v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rewards serve as proxies for human preferences and play a crucial role in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). However, if these rewards are inherently imperfect, exhibiting various biases, they can adversely affect the alignment of large language models (LLMs). In this paper, we collectively define the various biases present in rewards as the problem of reward unfairness. We propose a bias-agnostic method to address the issue of reward fairness from a resource allocation perspective, without specifically designing for each type of bias, yet effectively mitigating them. Specifically, we model preference learning as a resource allocation problem, treating rewards as resources to be allocated while considering the trade-off between utility and fairness in their distribution. We propose two methods, Fairness Regularization and Fairness Coefficient, to achieve fairness in rewards. We apply our methods in both verification and reinforcement learning scenarios to obtain a fairness reward model and a policy model, respectively. Experiments conducted in these scenarios demonstrate that our approach aligns LLMs with human preferences in a more fair manner.</p></details> | Accepted to ACL 2025 |
| **[Reward Generalization in RLHF: A Topological Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10184v7)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing alignment methods share a common topology of information flow, where reward information is collected from humans, modeled with preference learning, and used to tune language models. However, this shared topology has not been systematically characterized, nor have its alternatives been thoroughly explored, leaving the problems of low data efficiency and unreliable generalization unaddressed. As a solution, we introduce a theory of reward generalization in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), focusing on the topology of information flow at both macro and micro levels. At the macro level, we portray the RLHF information flow as an autoencoding process over behavior distributions, formalizing the RLHF objective of distributional consistency between human preference and model behavior. At the micro level, we present induced Bayesian networks to model the impact of dataset topologies on reward generalization. Combining analysis on both levels, we propose reward modeling from tree-structured preference information. It is shown to reduce reward uncertainty by up to $\Theta(\log n/\log\log n)$ times compared to baselines, where $n$ is the dataset size. Validation on three NLP tasks shows that it achieves an average win rate of 65% against baselines, thus improving reward generalization for free via topology design, while reducing the amount of data requiring annotation.</p></details> | <details><summary>46 pa...</summary><p>46 pages, ACL 2025 (Findings)</p></details> |
| **[Learning a Pessimistic Reward Model in RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20556v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work proposes `PET', a novel pessimistic reward fine-tuning method, to learn a pessimistic reward model robust against reward hacking in offline reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Traditional reward modeling techniques in RLHF train an imperfect reward model, on which a KL regularization plays a pivotal role in mitigating reward hacking when optimizing a policy. Such an intuition-based method still suffers from reward hacking, and the policies with large KL divergence from the dataset distribution are excluded during learning. In contrast, we show that when optimizing a policy on a pessimistic reward model fine-tuned through PET, reward hacking can be prevented without relying on any regularization. We test our methods on the standard TL;DR summarization dataset. We find that one can learn a high-quality policy on our pessimistic reward without using any regularization. Such a policy has a high KL divergence from the dataset distribution while having high performance in practice. In summary, our work shows the feasibility of learning a pessimistic reward model against reward hacking. The agent can greedily search for the policy with a high pessimistic reward without suffering from reward hacking.</p></details> |  |
| **[SCAR: Shapley Credit Assignment for More Efficient RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20417v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is a widely used technique for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences, yet it often suffers from sparse reward signals, making effective credit assignment challenging. In typical setups, the reward model provides a single scalar score for an entire generated sequence, offering little insight into which token or span-level decisions were responsible for the outcome. To address this, we propose Shapley Credit Assignment Rewards (SCAR), a novel method that leverages Shapley values in cooperative game theory. SCAR distributes the total sequence-level reward among constituent tokens or text spans based on their principled marginal contributions. This creates dense reward signals, crucially, without necessitating the training of auxiliary critique models or recourse to fine-grained human annotations at intermediate generation stages. Unlike prior dense reward methods, SCAR offers a game-theoretic foundation for fair credit attribution. Theoretically, we demonstrate that SCAR preserves the original optimal policy, and empirically, across diverse tasks including sentiment control, text summarization, and instruction tuning, we show that SCAR converges significantly faster and achieves higher final reward scores compared to standard RLHF and attention-based dense reward baselines. Our findings suggest that SCAR provides a more effective and theoretically sound method for credit assignment in RLHF, leading to more efficient alignment of LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Understanding the Performance Gap in Preference Learning: A Dichotomy of RLHF and DPO](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19770v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a fine-grained theoretical analysis of the performance gap between reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and direct preference optimization (DPO) under a representation gap. Our study decomposes this gap into two sources: an explicit representation gap under exact optimization and an implicit representation gap under finite samples. In the exact optimization setting, we characterize how the relative capacities of the reward and policy model classes influence the final policy qualities. We show that RLHF, DPO, or online DPO can outperform one another depending on the type of model mis-specifications. Notably, online DPO can outperform both RLHF and standard DPO when the reward and policy model classes are isomorphic and both mis-specified. In the approximate optimization setting, we provide a concrete construction where the ground-truth reward is implicitly sparse and show that RLHF requires significantly fewer samples than DPO to recover an effective reward model -- highlighting a statistical advantage of two-stage learning. Together, these results provide a comprehensive understanding of the performance gap between RLHF and DPO under various settings, and offer practical insights into when each method is preferred.</p></details> | 30 pages, 5 figures |
| **[KL-regularization Itself is Differentially Private in Bandits and RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18407v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differential Privacy (DP) provides a rigorous framework for privacy, ensuring the outputs of data-driven algorithms remain statistically indistinguishable across datasets that differ in a single entry. While guaranteeing DP generally requires explicitly injecting noise either to the algorithm itself or to its outputs, the intrinsic randomness of existing algorithms presents an opportunity to achieve DP ``for free''. In this work, we explore the role of regularization in achieving DP across three different decision-making problems: multi-armed bandits, linear contextual bandits, and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), in offline data settings. We show that adding KL-regularization to the learning objective (a common approach in optimization algorithms) makes the action sampled from the resulting stochastic policy itself differentially private. This offers a new route to privacy guarantees without additional noise injection, while also preserving the inherent advantage of regularization in enhancing performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[On The Global Convergence Of Online RLHF With Neural Parametrization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15610v2)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The importance of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values cannot be overstated. RLHF is a three-stage process that includes supervised fine-tuning (SFT), reward learning, and policy learning. Although there are several offline and online approaches to aligning LLMs, they often suffer from distribution shift issues. These issues arise from the inability to accurately capture the distributional interdependence between the reward learning and policy learning stages. Consequently, this has led to various approximated approaches, but the theoretical insights and motivations remain largely limited to tabular settings, which do not hold in practice. This gap between theoretical insights and practical implementations is critical. It is challenging to address this gap as it requires analyzing the performance of AI alignment algorithms in neural network-parameterized settings. Although bi-level formulations have shown promise in addressing distribution shift issues, they suffer from the hyper-gradient problem, and current approaches lack efficient algorithms to solve this. In this work, we tackle these challenges employing the bi-level formulation laid out in Kwon et al. (2024) along with the assumption \emph{Weak Gradient Domination} to demonstrate convergence in an RLHF setup, obtaining a sample complexity of $\epsilon^{-\frac{7}{2}}$ . Our key contributions are twofold: (i) We propose a bi-level formulation for AI alignment in parameterized settings and introduce a first-order approach to solve this problem. (ii) We analyze the theoretical convergence rates of the proposed algorithm and derive state-of-the-art bounds. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to establish convergence rate bounds and global optimality for the RLHF framework in neural network-parameterized settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>The u...</summary><p>The updated version of this paper is arXiv:2503.17644</p></details> |
| **[Reward Model Overoptimisation in Iterated RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18126v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is a widely used method for aligning large language models with human preferences. However, RLHF often suffers from reward model overoptimisation, in which models overfit to the reward function, resulting in non-generalisable policies that exploit the idiosyncrasies and peculiarities of the reward function. A common mitigation is iterated RLHF, in which reward models are repeatedly retrained with updated human feedback and policies are re-optimised. Despite its increasing adoption, the dynamics of overoptimisation in this setting remain poorly understood. In this work, we present the first comprehensive study of overoptimisation in iterated RLHF. We systematically analyse key design choices - how reward model training data is transferred across iterations, which reward function is used for optimisation, and how policies are initialised. Using the controlled AlpacaFarm benchmark, we observe that overoptimisation tends to decrease over successive iterations, as reward models increasingly approximate ground-truth preferences. However, performance gains diminish over time, and while reinitialising from the base policy is robust, it limits optimisation flexibility. Other initialisation strategies often fail to recover from early overoptimisation. These findings offer actionable insights for building more stable and generalisable RLHF pipelines.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 17 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

Specifically, under linear modeling assumptions, we present a unified analysis covering both reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and direct preference optimization (DPO) under different privacy-corruption scenarios, such as Local differential privacy-then-Corruption (LTC), where human preference labels are privatized before being corrupted by an adversary, and Corruption-then-Local differential privacy (CTL), where labels are corrupted before privacy protection. Our analysis leverages a reduction framework that reduces the offline alignment problem under linear modeling assumptions to parameter estimation in logistic regression. This framework allows us to establish an interesting separation result between LTC and CTL, demonstrating that LTC presents a greater challenge than CTL in offline alignment, even under linear models. As important by-products, our findings also advance the state-of-the-art theoretical results in offline alignment under privacy-only or corruption-only scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[DPO Meets PPO: Reinforced Token Optimization for RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18922v4)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the classical Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) framework, Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is employed to learn from sparse, sentence-level rewards -- a challenging scenario in traditional deep reinforcement learning. Despite the great successes of PPO in the alignment of large language models, its open-source implementation is still largely sub-optimal. To address these issues, we introduce a framework that models RLHF problems as a Markov decision process (MDP), enabling the capture of fine-grained token-wise information. Under this framework, we introduce an algorithm Reinforced Token Optimization (\texttt{RTO}), which learns the token-wise reward function from preference data and performs policy optimization based on this learned token-wise reward signal. Theoretically, \texttt{RTO} is proven to have the capability of finding the near-optimal policy sample-efficiently. For its practical implementation, \texttt{RTO} innovatively integrates Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and PPO. DPO, originally derived from sparse sentence rewards, surprisingly provides us with a token-wise characterization of response quality, which is seamlessly incorporated into our subsequent PPO training stage. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \texttt{RTO} performs better than PPO and other direct preference learning algorithms. In particular, RTO outperforms PPO by 7.5 points on the AlpacaEval 2 benchmark and by 4.1 points on Arena-Hard. Our code and models are available at \href{https://github.com/zkshan2002/RTO}{https://github.com/zkshan2002/RTO}.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |
| **[Multi-Level Aware Preference Learning: Enhancing RLHF for Complex Multi-Instruction Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12845v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>RLHF has emerged as a predominant approach for aligning artificial intelligence systems with human preferences, demonstrating exceptional and measurable efficacy in instruction following tasks; however, it exhibits insufficient compliance capabilities when confronted with complex multi-instruction tasks. Conventional approaches rely heavily on human annotation or more sophisticated large language models, thereby introducing substantial resource expenditure or potential bias concerns. Meanwhile, alternative synthetic methods that augment standard preference datasets often compromise the model's semantic quality. Our research identifies a critical oversight in existing techniques, which predominantly focus on comparing responses while neglecting valuable latent signals embedded within prompt inputs, and which only focus on preference disparities at the intra-sample level, while neglecting to account for the inter-sample level preference differentials that exist among preference data. To leverage these previously neglected indicators, we propose a novel Multi-level Aware Preference Learning (MAPL) framework, capable of enhancing multi-instruction capabilities. Specifically, for any given response in original preference data pairs, we construct varied prompts with a preference relation under different conditions, in order to learn intra-sample level preference disparities. Furthermore, for any given original preference pair, we synthesize multi-instruction preference pairs to capture preference discrepancies at the inter-sample level. Building on the two datasets constructed above, we consequently devise two sophisticated training objective functions. Subsequently, our framework integrates seamlessly into both Reward Modeling and Direct Preference Optimization paradigms. Through rigorous evaluation across multiple benchmarks, we empirically validate the efficacy of our framework.</p></details> |  |

However, RLHF often suffers from reward hacking, wherein policy learning exploits flaws in the trained reward model to maximize reward scores without genuinely aligning with human preferences. A significant example of such reward hacking is length bias, where reward models usually favor longer responses irrespective of actual response quality. Previous works on length bias have notable limitations, these approaches either mitigate bias without characterizing the bias form, or simply assume a linear length-reward relation. To accurately model the intricate nature of length bias and facilitate more effective bias mitigation, we propose FiMi-RM (Bias Fitting to Mitigate Length Bias of Reward Model in RLHF), a framework that autonomously learns and corrects underlying bias patterns. Our approach consists of three stages: First, we train a standard reward model which inherently contains length bias. Next, we deploy a lightweight fitting model to explicitly capture the non-linear relation between length and reward. Finally, we incorporate this learned relation into the reward model to debias. Experimental results demonstrate that FiMi-RM achieves a more balanced length-reward distribution. Furthermore, when applied to alignment algorithms, our debiased reward model improves length-controlled win rate and reduces verbosity without compromising its performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Due t...</summary><p>Due to the word limit for arXiv abstract, the abstract here has been abridged compared to the one in the PDF</p></details> |

A Policy Coverage Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19255v3)** | 2025-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sample efficiency is critical for online Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). While existing works investigate sample-efficient online exploration strategies, the potential of utilizing misspecified yet relevant reward models to accelerate learning remains underexplored. This paper studies how to transfer knowledge from those imperfect reward models in online RLHF. We start by identifying a novel property due to KL-regularization in the RLHF objective: \emph{a policy's coverability of the optimal policy is captured by its sub-optimality}. Building on this insight, we propose novel transfer learning principles and a theoretical algorithm -- \emph{\textbf{T}ransfer \textbf{P}olicy \textbf{O}ptimization (\textbf{TPO})} -- with provable benefits compared to standard online learning. Empirically, inspired by our theoretical findings, we develop a win-rate-based transfer policy selection strategy with improved computational efficiency. Moreover, our empirical transfer learning technique is modular and can be integrated with various policy optimization methods, such as DPO, IPO and XPO, to further enhance their performance. We validate the effectiveness of our method through experiments on summarization tasks.</p></details> | 36 Pages; ICML 2025 |
| **[Online Bandit Learning with Offline Preference Data for Improved RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09574v4)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) is at the core of fine-tuning methods for generative AI models for language and images. Such feedback is often sought as rank or preference feedback from human raters, as opposed to eliciting scores since the latter tends to be noisy. On the other hand, RL theory and algorithms predominantly assume that a reward feedback is available. In particular, approaches for online learning that can be helpful in adaptive data collection via active learning cannot incorporate offline preference data. In this paper, we adopt a finite-armed linear bandit model as a prototypical model of online learning. We consider an offline preference dataset to be available generated by an expert of unknown 'competence'. We propose warmPref-PS, a posterior sampling algorithm for online learning that can be warm-started with an offline dataset with noisy preference feedback. We show that by modeling the 'competence' of the expert that generated it, we are able to use such a dataset most effectively. We support our claims with novel theoretical analysis of its Bayesian regret, as well as, extensive empirical evaluation of an approximate loss function that optimizes for infinitely many arms, and performs substantially better than baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Policy-labeled Preference Learning: Is Preference Enough for RLHF?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06273v2)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To design rewards that align with human goals, Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a prominent technique for learning reward functions from human preferences and optimizing policies via reinforcement learning algorithms. However, existing RLHF methods often misinterpret trajectories as being generated by an optimal policy, causing inaccurate likelihood estimation and suboptimal learning. Inspired by Direct Preference Optimization framework which directly learns optimal policy without explicit reward, we propose policy-labeled preference learning (PPL), to resolve likelihood mismatch issues by modeling human preferences with regret, which reflects behavior policy information. We also provide a contrastive KL regularization, derived from regret-based principles, to enhance RLHF in sequential decision making. Experiments in high-dimensional continuous control tasks demonstrate PPL's significant improvements in offline RLHF performance and its effectiveness in online settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Asynchronous RLHF: Faster and More Efficient Off-Policy RL for Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18252v3)** | 2025-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The dominant paradigm for RLHF is online and on-policy RL: synchronously generating from the large language model (LLM) policy, labelling with a reward model, and learning using feedback on the LLM's own outputs. While performant, this paradigm is computationally inefficient. Inspired by classical deep RL literature, we propose separating generation and learning in RLHF. This enables asynchronous generation of new samples while simultaneously training on old samples, leading to faster training and more compute-optimal scaling. However, asynchronous training relies on an underexplored regime, online but off-policy RLHF: learning on samples from previous iterations of our model which give a worse training signal. We tackle the fundamental challenge in this regime: how much off-policyness can we tolerate for asynchronous training to speed up learning but maintain performance? Among several RLHF algorithms we test, online DPO is found to be most robust to off-policy data, and robustness increases with the scale of the policy model. We study further compute optimizations for asynchronous RLHF but find that they come at a performance cost, giving rise to a trade-off. We verify the scalability of asynchronous RLHF by training a general-purpose chatbot from LLaMA 3.1 8B on an instruction-following task ~40% faster than a synchronous run while matching final performance. Finally, we extend our results to math and reasoning to demonstrate asynchronous RL can finetune Rho 1B on GSM8k ~70% faster while matching synchronous accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted at ICLR 2025, code at https://github.com/mnoukhov/async_rlhf, integrated into the open-instruct library https://github.com/allenai/open-instruct</p></details> |
| **[ReaL: Efficient RLHF Training of Large Language Models with Parameter Reallocation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14088v2)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is a pivotal technique for empowering large language model (LLM) applications. Compared with the supervised training process of LLMs, the RLHF training process is much more sophisticated, requiring a diverse range of computation workloads with intricate dependencies between multiple LLM instances. Therefore, simply adopting the fixed parallelization strategies from supervised training for LLMs can be insufficient for RLHF and result in low training efficiency. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel technique named parameter ReaLlocation, which dynamically adapts the parallelization strategies for different workloads during training by redistributing LLM parameters across the training cluster. Building upon this idea, we introduce ReaL, a pioneering system for efficient RLHF training. ReaL introduces the concept of an execution plan, which defines a fine-grained resource allocation and parallelization strategy particularly designed for RLHF training. Based on this concept, ReaL employs a tailored search algorithm with a lightweight run-time estimator to automatically discover an efficient execution plan for an instance of RLHF experiment. Subsequently, the runtime engine deploys the selected plan by effectively parallelizing computations and redistributing parameters. We evaluate ReaL on the LLaMA models with up to 70 billion parameters and 128 GPUs. The experimental results demonstrate that ReaL achieves speedups of up to $3.58\times$ compared to baseline methods. Furthermore, the execution plans generated by ReaL exhibit an average of $81\%$ performance improvement over heuristic approaches based on Megatron-LM in the long-context scenario. The source code of ReaL is publicly available at https://github.com/openpsi-project/ReaLHF .</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages (20 pages with references and the appendix), 17 figures.

| **[Regressing the Relative Future: Efficient Policy Optimization for Multi-turn RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04612v2)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success at tasks like summarization that involve a single turn of interaction. However, they can still struggle with multi-turn tasks like dialogue that require long-term planning. Previous works on multi-turn dialogue extend single-turn reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) methods to the multi-turn setting by treating all prior dialogue turns as a long context. Such approaches suffer from covariate shift: the conversations in the training set have previous turns generated by some reference policy, which means that low training error may not necessarily correspond to good performance when the learner is actually in the conversation loop. In response, we introduce REgressing the RELative FUture (REFUEL), an efficient policy optimization approach designed to address multi-turn RLHF in LLMs. REFUEL employs a single model to estimate $Q$-values and trains on self-generated data, addressing the covariate shift issue. REFUEL frames the multi-turn RLHF problem as a sequence of regression tasks on iteratively collected datasets, enabling ease of implementation. Theoretically, we prove that REFUEL can match the performance of any policy covered by the training set. Empirically, we evaluate our algorithm by using Llama-3.1-70B-it to simulate a user in conversation with our model. REFUEL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods such as DPO and REBEL across various settings. Furthermore, despite having only 8 billion parameters, Llama-3-8B-it fine-tuned with REFUEL outperforms Llama-3.1-70B-it on long multi-turn dialogues. Implementation of REFUEL can be found at https://github.com/ZhaolinGao/REFUEL/, and models trained by REFUEL can be found at https://huggingface.co/Cornell-AGI.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimizing RLHF Training for Large Language Models with Stage Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13221v3)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present RLHFuse, an efficient training system with stage fusion for Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). Due to the intrinsic nature of RLHF training, i.e., the data skewness in the generation stage and the pipeline bubbles in the training stage, existing RLHF systems suffer from low GPU utilization. RLHFuse breaks the traditional view of RLHF workflow as a composition of individual tasks, splitting each task into finer-grained subtasks, and performing stage fusion to improve GPU utilization. RLHFuse contains two key ideas. First, for generation and inference tasks, RLHFuse splits them into sample-level subtasks, enabling efficient inter-stage fusion to overlap the execution of generation and inference stages, thus mitigating the original generation bottleneck dominated by long-tailed samples. Second, for training tasks, RLHFuse breaks them into subtasks of micro-batches and performs intra-stage fusion to concurrently execute these subtasks in the training stage with a fused pipeline schedule, effectively mitigating the pipeline bubbles. The experiments show that RLHFuse increases the training throughput by up to $3.7\times$, compared to existing systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Federated RLHF with Aggregated Client Preference for LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03038v3)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) fine-tunes a pretrained large language model (LLM) using user preference data, enabling it to generate content aligned with human preferences. However, due to privacy concerns, users may be reluctant to share sensitive preference data. To address this, we propose utilizing Federated Learning (FL) techniques, allowing large-scale preference collection from diverse real-world users without requiring them to transmit data to a central server. Our federated RLHF methods (i.e., FedBis and FedBiscuit) encode each client's preferences into binary selectors and aggregate them to capture common preferences. In particular, FedBiscuit overcomes key challenges, such as preference heterogeneity and reward hacking, through innovative solutions like grouping clients with similar preferences to reduce heterogeneity and using multiple binary selectors to enhance LLM output quality. To evaluate the performance of the proposed methods, we establish the first federated RLHF benchmark with a heterogeneous human preference dataset. Experimental results show that by integrating the LLM with aggregated client preferences, FedBis and FedBiscuit significantly enhance the professionalism and readability of the generated content.</p></details> | ICLR'25 |
| **[Information-Theoretic Reward Decomposition for Generalizable RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06020v1)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A generalizable reward model is crucial in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) as it enables correctly evaluating unseen prompt-response pairs. However, existing reward models lack this ability, as they are typically trained by increasing the reward gap between chosen and rejected responses, while overlooking the prompts that the responses are conditioned on. Consequently, when the trained reward model is evaluated on prompt-response pairs that lie outside the data distribution, neglecting the effect of prompts may result in poor generalization of the reward model. To address this issue, we decompose the reward value into two independent components: prompt-free reward and prompt-related reward. Prompt-free reward represents the evaluation that is determined only by responses, while the prompt-related reward reflects the reward that derives from both the prompt and the response. We extract these two components from an information-theoretic perspective, which requires no extra models. Subsequently, we propose a new reward learning algorithm by prioritizing data samples based on their prompt-free reward values. Through toy examples, we demonstrate that the extracted prompt-free and prompt-related rewards effectively characterize two parts of the reward model. Further, standard evaluations show that our method improves both the alignment performance and the generalization capability of the reward model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Work ...</summary><p>Work done during internships at Institute of Artificial Intelligence (TeleAI), China Telecom</p></details> |
| **[A Unified Pairwise Framework for RLHF: Bridging Generative Reward Modeling and Policy Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04950v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a important paradigm for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences during post-training. This framework typically involves two stages: first, training a reward model on human preference data, followed by optimizing the language model using reinforcement learning algorithms. However, current RLHF approaches may constrained by two limitations. First, existing RLHF frameworks often rely on Bradley-Terry models to assign scalar rewards based on pairwise comparisons of individual responses. However, this approach imposes significant challenges on reward model (RM), as the inherent variability in prompt-response pairs across different contexts demands robust calibration capabilities from the RM. Second, reward models are typically initialized from generative foundation models, such as pre-trained or supervised fine-tuned models, despite the fact that reward models perform discriminative tasks, creating a mismatch. This paper introduces Pairwise-RL, a RLHF framework that addresses these challenges through a combination of generative reward modeling and a pairwise proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm. Pairwise-RL unifies reward model training and its application during reinforcement learning within a consistent pairwise paradigm, leveraging generative modeling techniques to enhance reward model performance and score calibration. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that Pairwise-RL outperforms traditional RLHF frameworks across both internal evaluation datasets and standard public benchmarks, underscoring its effectiveness in improving alignment and model behavior.</p></details> | 11oages,2 figures |
| **[UNA: Unifying Alignments of RLHF/PPO, DPO and KTO by a Generalized Implicit Reward Function](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15339v3)** | 2025-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An LLM is pretrained on trillions of tokens, but the pretrained LLM may still generate undesired responses. To solve this problem, alignment techniques such as RLHF, DPO and KTO are proposed. However, these alignment techniques have limitations. For example, RLHF requires training the reward model and policy separately, which is complex, time-consuming, memory intensive and unstable during training processes. DPO proposes a mapping between an optimal policy and a reward, greatly simplifying the training process of RLHF. However, it can not take full advantages of a reward model and it is limited to pairwise preference data. In this paper, we propose \textbf{UN}ified \textbf{A}lignment (UNA) which unifies RLHF/PPO, DPO and KTO. Firstly, we mathematically prove that given the classical RLHF objective, the optimal policy is induced by a generalize implicit reward function. With this novel mapping between a reward model and an optimal policy, UNA can 1. unify RLHF/PPO, DPO and KTO into a supervised learning of minimizing the difference between an implicit reward and an explicit reward; 2. outperform RLHF/PPO while simplify, stabilize, speed up and reduce memory burden of RL fine-tuning process; 3. accommodate different feedback types including pairwise, binary and scalar feedback. Downstream experiments show UNA outperforms DPO, KTO and RLHF.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sharpe Ratio-Guided Active Learning for Preference Optimization in RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22137v1)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has become a cornerstone of the training and alignment pipeline for large language models (LLMs). Recent advances, such as direct preference optimization (DPO), have simplified the preference learning step. However, collecting preference data remains a challenging and costly process, often requiring expert annotation. This cost can be mitigated by carefully selecting the data points presented for annotation. In this work, we propose an active learning approach to efficiently select prompt and preference pairs using a risk assessment strategy based on the Sharpe Ratio. To address the challenge of unknown preferences prior to annotation, our method evaluates the gradients of all potential preference annotations to assess their impact on model updates. These gradient-based evaluations enable risk assessment of data points regardless of the annotation outcome. By leveraging the DPO loss derivations, we derive a closed-form expression for computing these Sharpe ratios on a per-tuple basis, ensuring our approach remains both tractable and computationally efficient. We also introduce two variants of our method, each making different assumptions about prior information. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the baseline by up to 5% in win rates against the chosen completion with limited human preference data across several language models and real-world datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[One Framework to Rule Them All: Unifying RL-Based and RL-Free Methods in RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19523v2)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this article, we primarily examine a variety of RL-based and RL-free methods designed to address Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Large Reasoning Models (LRMs). We begin with a concise overview of the typical steps involved in RLHF and LRMs. Next, we reinterpret several RL-based and RL-free algorithms through the perspective of neural structured bandit prediction, providing a clear conceptual framework that uncovers a deeper connection between these seemingly distinct approaches. Following this, we briefly review some core principles of reinforcement learning, drawing attention to an often-overlooked aspect in existing RLHF studies. This leads to a detailed derivation of the standard RLHF objective within a full RL context, demonstrating its equivalence to neural structured bandit prediction. Finally, by reinvestigating the principles behind Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), we pinpoint areas needing adjustment, which culminates in the introduction of the Generalized Reinforce Optimization (GRO) framework, seamlessly integrating RL-based and RL-free methods in RLHF. We look forward to the community's efforts to empirically validate GRO and invite constructive feedback.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Shared Low-Rank Adaptation Approach to Personalized RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19201v1)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a pivotal technique for aligning artificial intelligence systems with human values, achieving remarkable success in fine-tuning large language models. However, existing RLHF frameworks often assume that human preferences are relatively homogeneous and can be captured by a single, unified reward model. This assumption overlooks the inherent diversity and heterogeneity across individuals, limiting the adaptability of RLHF to personalized scenarios and risking misalignments that can diminish user satisfaction and trust in AI systems. In this paper, we address these challenges by introducing Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) into the personalized RLHF framework. We apply LoRA in the the aggregated parameter space of all personalized reward functions, thereby enabling efficient learning of personalized reward models from potentially limited local datasets. Our approach exploits potential shared structures among the local ground-truth reward models while allowing for individual adaptation, without relying on restrictive assumptions about shared representations as in prior works. We further establish sample complexity guarantees for our method. Theoretical analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach in capturing both shared and individual-specific structures within heterogeneous human preferences, addressing the dual challenge of personalization requirements and practical data constraints. Experimental results on real-world datasets corroborate the efficiency of our algorithm in the personalized RLHF setting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at AISTATS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Mitigating Reward Over-Optimization in RLHF via Behavior-Supported Regularization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18130v1)** | 2025-03-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is an effective method for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values. However, reward over-optimization remains an open challenge leading to discrepancies between the performance of LLMs under the reward model and the true human objectives. A primary contributor to reward over-optimization is the extrapolation error that arises when the reward model evaluates out-of-distribution (OOD) responses. However, current methods still fail to prevent the increasing frequency of OOD response generation during the reinforcement learning (RL) process and are not effective at handling extrapolation errors from OOD responses. In this work, we propose the Behavior-Supported Policy Optimization (BSPO) method to mitigate the reward over-optimization issue. Specifically, we define behavior policy as the next token distribution of the reward training dataset to model the in-distribution (ID) region of the reward model. Building on this, we introduce the behavior-supported Bellman operator to regularize the value function, penalizing all OOD values without impacting the ID ones. Consequently, BSPO reduces the generation of OOD responses during the RL process, thereby avoiding overestimation caused by the reward model's extrapolation errors. Theoretically, we prove that BSPO guarantees a monotonic improvement of the supported policy until convergence to the optimal behavior-supported policy. Empirical results from extensive experiments show that BSPO outperforms baselines in preventing reward over-optimization due to OOD evaluation and finding the optimal ID policy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Understanding the Effects of RLHF on the Quality and Detectability of LLM-Generated Texts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17965v1)** | 2025-03-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance on a range of downstream NLP tasks by generating text that closely resembles human writing. However, the ease of achieving this similarity raises concerns from potential malicious uses at scale by bad actors, as LLM-generated text becomes increasingly difficult to discern from human text. Although detection methods have been developed to address this issue, bad actors can further manipulate LLM-generated texts to make them less detectable. In this work, we study how further editing texts with Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), which aligns model outputs with human preferences, affects (a) the quality of generated texts for two tasks, and (b) the performance of LLM-generated text detectors, looking at both training-based and zero-shot detection methods. Although RLHF improves the quality of LLM-generated texts, we find that it also tends to produce more detectable, lengthy, and repetitive outputs. Additionally, we observe that training-based detectors are vulnerable to short texts and to texts that incorporate code, whereas zero-shot detectors exhibit greater robustness.</p></details> | 14 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Aligning to What? Limits to RLHF Based Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09025v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is increasingly used to align large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. However, the effectiveness of RLHF in addressing underlying biases remains unclear. This study investigates the relationship between RLHF and both covert and overt biases in LLMs, particularly focusing on biases against African Americans. We applied various RLHF techniques (DPO, ORPO, and RLOO) to Llama 3 8B and evaluated the covert and overt biases of the resulting models using matched-guise probing and explicit bias testing. We performed additional tests with DPO on different base models and datasets; among several implications, we found that SFT before RLHF calcifies model biases. Additionally, we extend the tools for measuring biases to multi-modal models. Through our experiments we collect evidence that indicates that current alignment techniques are inadequate for nebulous tasks such as mitigating covert biases, highlighting the need for capable datasets, data curating techniques, or alignment tools.</p></details> |  |
| **[ROCM: RLHF on consistency models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06171v1)** | 2025-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have revolutionized generative modeling in continuous domains like image, audio, and video synthesis. However, their iterative sampling process leads to slow generation and inefficient training, challenges that are further exacerbated when incorporating Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) due to sparse rewards and long time horizons. Consistency models address these issues by enabling single-step or efficient multi-step generation, significantly reducing computational costs. In this work, we propose a direct reward optimization framework for applying RLHF to consistency models, incorporating distributional regularization to enhance training stability and prevent reward hacking. We investigate various $f$-divergences as regularization strategies, striking a balance between reward maximization and model consistency. Unlike policy gradient methods, our approach leverages first-order gradients, making it more efficient and less sensitive to hyperparameter tuning. Empirical results show that our method achieves competitive or superior performance compared to policy gradient based RLHF methods, across various automatic metrics and human evaluation. Additionally, our analysis demonstrates the impact of different regularization techniques in improving model generalization and preventing overfitting.</p></details> |  |

We establish a close theoretical connection between reinforcement learning from human feedback RLHF and imitation learning (IL), revealing that RLHF implicitly performs imitation learning on the preference data distribution. Building on this connection, we propose DIL, a principled framework that directly optimizes the imitation learning objective. DIL provides a unified imitation learning perspective on alignment, encompassing existing alignment algorithms as special cases while naturally introducing new variants. By bridging IL and RLHF, DIL offers new insights into alignment with RLHF. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DIL outperforms existing methods on various challenging benchmarks.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |
| **[LLM Misalignment via Adversarial RLHF Platforms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03039v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning has shown remarkable performance in aligning language models with human preferences, leading to the rise of attention towards developing RLHF platforms. These platforms enable users to fine-tune models without requiring any expertise in developing complex machine learning algorithms. While these platforms offer useful features such as reward modeling and RLHF fine-tuning, their security and reliability remain largely unexplored. Given the growing adoption of RLHF and open-source RLHF frameworks, we investigate the trustworthiness of these systems and their potential impact on behavior of LLMs. In this paper, we present an attack targeting publicly available RLHF tools. In our proposed attack, an adversarial RLHF platform corrupts the LLM alignment process by selectively manipulating data samples in the preference dataset. In this scenario, when a user's task aligns with the attacker's objective, the platform manipulates a subset of the preference dataset that contains samples related to the attacker's target. This manipulation results in a corrupted reward model, which ultimately leads to the misalignment of the language model. Our results demonstrate that such an attack can effectively steer LLMs toward undesirable behaviors within the targeted domains. Our work highlights the critical need to explore the vulnerabilities of RLHF platforms and their potential to cause misalignment in LLMs during the RLHF fine-tuning process.</p></details> |  |
| **[Taming Overconfidence in LLMs: Reward Calibration in RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09724v2)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language model calibration refers to the alignment between the confidence of the model and the actual performance of its responses. While previous studies point out the overconfidence phenomenon in Large Language Models (LLMs) and show that LLMs trained with Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) are overconfident with a more sharpened output probability, in this study, we reveal that RLHF tends to lead models to express verbalized overconfidence in their own responses. We investigate the underlying cause of this overconfidence and demonstrate that reward models used for Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) exhibit inherent biases towards high-confidence scores regardless of the actual quality of responses. Building upon this insight, we propose two PPO variants: PPO-M: PPO with Calibrated Reward Modeling and PPO-C: PPO with Calibrated Reward Calculation. PPO-M integrates explicit confidence scores in reward model training, which calibrates reward models to better capture the alignment between response quality and verbalized confidence. PPO-C adjusts the reward score during PPO based on the difference between the current reward and the exponential average of past rewards. Both PPO-M and PPO-C can be seamlessly integrated into the current PPO pipeline and do not require additional golden labels. We evaluate our methods on both Llama3-8B and Mistral-7B across six diverse datasets including multiple-choice and open-ended generation. Experimental results demonstrate that both of our methods can reduce calibration error and maintain performance comparable to standard PPO. We further show that they could preserve model capabilities in open-ended conversational settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating Defences against Unsafe Feedback in RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12914v3)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While there has been progress towards aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human values and ensuring safe behaviour at inference time, safety guards can easily be removed when fine tuned on unsafe and harmful datasets. While this setting has been treated extensively, another popular training paradigm, learning from unsafe feedback with reinforcement learning, has previously been unexplored. This is concerning due to the widespread deployment of feedback collection systems. We address this gap by providing an analysis of learning settings where feedback is harmful, i.e. that unsafe samples are preferred over safe ones despite model developers goal to maintain safety. We find that safety-aligned LLMs easily explore unsafe action spaces via generating harmful text and optimize for reward that violates safety constraints indicating that current safety guards are not enough to prevent learning from unsafe feedback. In order to protect against this vulnerability, we adapt a number of both "implict" and "explicit" harmful fine-tuning defences to evaluate whether they are effective as learning constraints in an RLHF setting finding that no method is generally effective pointing to the need for more defence research. We end the paper with the observation that some defences work by performing "harmless reward hacking" for which we provide a theoretical explanation drawn from the theory of Constrained Markov Decision Processes and provide some direction for future defence development.</p></details> |  |
| **[Projection Optimization: A General Framework for Multi-Objective and Multi-Group RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15145v2)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) is a widely used fine-tuning approach that aligns machine learning model, particularly Language Model (LM) with human preferences. There are typically multiple objectives driving the preference, hence humans find it easier to express per-objective comparisons rather than a global preference between two choices. Multi-Objective RLHF (MORLHF) aims to use per-objective preference feedback and achieve Pareto optimality among these objectives by aggregating them into a single unified objective for optimization. However, nearly all prior works rely on linear aggregation, which rules out policies that favor specific objectives such as the worst one. The only existing approach using non-linear aggregation is computationally expensive due to its reward-based nature and the need for retraining whenever the aggregation parameters change. In this work, we address this limitation by transforming the non-linear aggregation maximization problem into a series of sub-problems. Each sub-problem involves only linear aggregation, making it computationally efficient to solve. We further extend our framework to handle multi-group scenarios, where each group has distinct weights for the objectives. Our method enables achieving consensus or maximizing the aggregated objective across all groups. Theoretically, we demonstrate that our algorithmic framework achieves sublinear regret and can be easily adapted to a reward-free algorithm. Empirically, leveraging our theoretical insights, we propose a nearly training-free algorithm once the optimal policies for individual objectives are obtained.</p></details> |  |
| **[Simplify RLHF as Reward-Weighted SFT: A Variational Method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11026v2)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is crucial for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human values. However, RLHF has been continuously challenged by its high complexity in implementation and computation consumption. Even with recent simplifications, such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Advantage Leftover Lunch (A-LoL), the problems of over-fitting and training instability remain hindering the alignment process from the expected optimal performance. To address the existing challenges, we propose a novel simplification of RLHF from the perspective of variational inference, called $\textbf{V}$ariational $\textbf{A}$lignment with $\textbf{R}$e-weighting ($\textbf{VAR}$). More specifically, by directly minimizing the distribution gap between the learning LLM policy and the optimal solution of RLHF, we transform the alignment objective into a reward-driven re-weighted supervised fine-tuning (SFT) form, which only requires minor adjustment on the SFT loss to obtain noticeable improvement on training stability and effectiveness. On comprehensive alignment and generation benchmarks, our VAR method has numerically achieved competitive performance in LLM alignment helpfulness and harmlessness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Value-Incentivized Preference Optimization: A Unified Approach to Online and Offline RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19320v4)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has demonstrated great promise in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preference. Depending on the availability of preference data, both online and offline RLHF are active areas of investigation. A key bottleneck is understanding how to incorporate uncertainty estimation in the reward function learned from the preference data for RLHF, regardless of how the preference data is collected. While the principles of optimism or pessimism under uncertainty are well-established in standard reinforcement learning (RL), a practically-implementable and theoretically-grounded form amenable to large language models is not yet available, as standard techniques for constructing confidence intervals become intractable under arbitrary policy parameterizations. In this paper, we introduce a unified approach to online and offline RLHF -- value-incentivized preference optimization (VPO) -- which regularizes the maximum-likelihood estimate of the reward function with the corresponding value function, modulated by a $\textit{sign}$ to indicate whether the optimism or pessimism is chosen. VPO also directly optimizes the policy with implicit reward modeling, and therefore shares a simpler RLHF pipeline similar to direct preference optimization. Theoretical guarantees of VPO are provided for both online and offline settings, matching the rates of their standard RL counterparts. Moreover, experiments on text summarization and dialog verify the practicality and effectiveness of VPO.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

It has been shown to enhance both generation quality and trustworthiness. While numerous works have focused on improving retrieval, generation, and evaluation, the role of reward models in reinforcement learning for optimizing RAG remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{RAG-Reward}, a framework designed to develop reward models to enable \textit{hallucination-free, comprehensive, reliable, and efficient RAG}. We define four key metrics to assess generation quality and develop an automated benchmarking pipeline to evaluate the outputs of multiple LLMs across a variety of RAG scenarios. Using \textbf{RAG-Reward}, we train reward models and apply {reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF)} to improve LLMs' effectiveness in RAG. Experimental results demonstrate that our reward model achieves state-of-the-art performance in automatic benchmarking and aligns closely with human evaluations. Furthermore, the improved generation quality of the trained policy model highlights the feasibility and efficiency of using RLHF to enhance RAG outputs.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Equilibrate RLHF: Towards Balancing Helpfulness-Safety Trade-off in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11555v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) based on human preferences, commonly achieved through reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), has been effective in improving their performance. However, maintaining LLM safety throughout the fine-tuning process remains a significant challenge, as resolving conflicts between safety and helpfulness can be non-trivial. Typically, the safety alignment of LLM is trained on data with safety-related categories. However, our experiments find that naively increasing the scale of safety training data usually leads the LLMs to an ``overly safe'' state rather than a ``truly safe'' state, boosting the refusal rate through extensive safety-aligned data without genuinely understanding the requirements for safe responses. Such an approach can inadvertently diminish the models' helpfulness. To understand the phenomenon, we first investigate the role of safety data by categorizing them into three different groups, and observe that each group behaves differently as training data scales up. To boost the balance between safety and helpfulness, we propose an Equilibrate RLHF framework including a Fine-grained Data-centric (FDC) approach that achieves better safety alignment even with fewer training data, and an Adaptive Message-wise Alignment (AMA) approach, which selectively highlight the key segments through a gradient masking strategy. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances the safety alignment of LLMs while balancing safety and helpfulness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sharp Analysis for KL-Regularized Contextual Bandits and RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04625v2)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reverse-Kullback-Leibler (KL) regularization has emerged to be a predominant technique used to enhance policy optimization in reinforcement learning (RL) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), which forces the learned policy to stay close to a reference policy. While the effectiveness and necessity of KL-regularization have been empirically demonstrated in various practical scenarios, current theoretical analysis of KL-regularized RLHF still obtains the same $\mathcal{O}(1 / \epsilon^2)$ sample complexity as problems without KL-regularization. To understand the fundamental distinction between policy learning objectives with KL-regularization and ones without KL-regularization, we are the first to theoretically demonstrate the power of KL-regularization by providing a sharp analysis for KL-regularized contextual bandits and RLHF, revealing an $\mathcal{O}(1 / \epsilon)$ sample complexity when $\epsilon$ is sufficiently small. We further explore the role of data coverage in contextual bandits and RLHF. While the coverage assumption is commonly employed in offline RLHF to link the samples from the reference policy to the optimal policy, often at the cost of a multiplicative dependence on the coverage coefficient, its impact on the sample complexity of online RLHF remains unclear. Previous theoretical analyses of online RLHF typically require explicit exploration and additional structural assumptions on the reward function class. In contrast, we show that with sufficient coverage from the reference policy, a simple two-stage mixed sampling strategy can achieve a sample complexity with only an additive dependence on the coverage coefficient. Our results provide a comprehensive understanding of the roles of KL-regularization and data coverage in RLHF, shedding light on the design of more efficient RLHF algorithms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Avoiding $\mathbf{exp(R_{max})}$ scaling in RLHF through Preference-based Exploration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00666v2)** | 2025-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a pivotal technique for large language model (LLM) alignment. This paper studies the setting of online RLHF and focus on improving sample efficiency. All existing algorithms in online RLHF, whether doing passive exploration or active exploration, suffer from a sample complexity that scales exponentially with the scale of the reward function. This fundamental limitation hinders their effectiveness in scenarios with heavily skewed preferences, e.g. questions with a unique correct solution. To address this, we introduce Self-Exploring Preference-Incentive Online Preference Optimization (SE-POPO), an online RLHF algorithm that for the first time achieves a sample complexity that scales polynomially with the reward scale, answering an open problem raised by Xie et al. (2024).. Theoretically, we demonstrate that the sample complexity of SE-POPO dominates that of existing exploration algorithms. Empirically, our systematic evaluation confirms that SE-POPO is more sample-efficient than both exploratory and non-exploratory baselines, in two primary application scenarios of RLHF as well as on public benchmarks, marking a significant step forward in RLHF algorithm design. The code is available at https://github.com/MYC000801/SE-POPO.</p></details> |  |
| **[Influencing Humans to Conform to Preference Models for RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06416v2)** | 2025-02-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Designing a reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) algorithm to approximate a human's unobservable reward function requires assuming, implicitly or explicitly, a model of human preferences. A preference model that poorly describes how humans generate preferences risks learning a poor approximation of the human's reward function. In this paper, we conduct three human studies to asses whether one can influence the expression of real human preferences to more closely conform to a desired preference model. Importantly, our approach does not seek to alter the human's unobserved reward function. Rather, we change how humans use this reward function to generate preferences, such that they better match whatever preference model is assumed by a particular RLHF algorithm. We introduce three interventions: showing humans the quantities that underlie a preference model, which is normally unobservable information derived from the reward function; training people to follow a specific preference model; and modifying the preference elicitation question. All intervention types show significant effects, providing practical tools to improve preference data quality and the resultant alignment of the learned reward functions. Overall we establish a novel research direction in model alignment: designing interfaces and training interventions to increase human conformance with the modeling assumptions of the algorithm that will learn from their input.</p></details> |  |

We introduce Federated Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (FedRLHF), a novel framework that decentralizes the RLHF process. FedRLHF enables collaborative policy learning across multiple clients without necessitating the sharing of raw data or human feedback, thereby ensuring robust privacy preservation. Leveraging federated reinforcement learning, each client integrates human feedback locally into their reward functions and updates their policies through personalized RLHF processes. We establish rigorous theoretical foundations for FedRLHF, providing convergence guarantees, and deriving sample complexity bounds that scale efficiently with the number of clients. Empirical evaluations on the MovieLens and IMDb datasets demonstrate that FedRLHF not only preserves user privacy but also achieves performance on par with centralized RLHF, while enhancing personalization across diverse client environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Updated for AAMAS 2025 camera-ready.

| **[Segmenting Text and Learning Their Rewards for Improved RLHF in Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02790v1)** | 2025-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has been widely adopted to align language models (LMs) with human preference. Prior RLHF works typically take a bandit formulation, which, though intuitive, ignores the sequential nature of LM generation and can suffer from the sparse reward issue. While recent works propose dense token-level RLHF, treating each token as an action may be oversubtle to proper reward assignment. In this paper, we seek to get the best of both by training and utilizing a segment-level reward model, which assigns a reward to each semantically complete text segment that spans over a short sequence of tokens. For reward learning, our method allows dynamic text segmentation and compatibility with standard sequence-preference datasets. For effective RL-based LM training against segment reward, we generalize the classical scalar bandit reward normalizers into location-aware normalizer functions and interpolate the segment reward for further densification. With these designs, our method performs competitively on three popular RLHF benchmarks for LM policy: AlpacaEval 2.0, Arena-Hard, and MT-Bench. Ablation studies are conducted to further demonstrate our method.</p></details> |  |

Automatic Analysis of Refusal Composition in IFT/RLHF Datasets and Refusal Behavior of Black-Box LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16974v1)** | 2024-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Refusals - instances where large language models (LLMs) decline or fail to fully execute user instructions - are crucial for both AI safety and AI capabilities and the reduction of hallucinations in particular. These behaviors are learned during post-training, especially in instruction fine-tuning (IFT) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). However, existing taxonomies and evaluation datasets for refusals are inadequate, often focusing solely on should-not-related (instead of cannot-related) categories, and lacking tools for auditing refusal content in black-box LLM outputs. We present a comprehensive framework for classifying LLM refusals: (a) a taxonomy of 16 refusal categories, (b) a human-annotated dataset of over 8,600 instances from publicly available IFT and RLHF datasets, (c) a synthetic dataset with 8,000 examples for each refusal category, and (d) classifiers trained for refusal classification. Our work enables precise auditing of refusal behaviors in black-box LLMs and automatic analyses of refusal patterns in large IFT and RLHF datasets. This facilitates the strategic adjustment of LLM refusals, contributing to the development of more safe and reliable LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024 Workshop SFLLM</p></details> |

On The Impact of Preference Alignment On Trustworthiness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18870v2)** | 2024-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The trustworthiness of Large Language Models (LLMs) refers to the extent to which their outputs are reliable, safe, and ethically aligned, and it has become a crucial consideration alongside their cognitive performance. In practice, Reinforcement Learning From Human Feedback (RLHF) has been widely used to align LLMs with labeled human preferences, but its assumed effect on model trustworthiness hasn't been rigorously evaluated. To bridge this knowledge gap, this study investigates how models aligned with general-purpose preference data perform across five trustworthiness verticals: toxicity, stereotypical bias, machine ethics, truthfulness, and privacy. Our results demonstrate that RLHF on human preferences doesn't automatically guarantee trustworthiness, and reverse effects are often observed. Furthermore, we propose to adapt efficient influence function based data attribution methods to the RLHF setting to better understand the influence of fine-tuning data on individual trustworthiness benchmarks, and show its feasibility by providing our estimated attribution scores. Together, our results underscore the need for more nuanced approaches for model alignment from both the data and framework perspectives, and we hope this research will guide the community towards developing language models that are increasingly capable without sacrificing trustworthiness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Solving the Inverse Alignment Problem for Efficient RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10529v1)** | 2024-12-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Collecting high-quality preference datasets for reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is resource-intensive and challenging. As a result, researchers often train reward models on extensive offline datasets which aggregate diverse generation sources and scoring/alignment policies. We hypothesize that this aggregation has an averaging effect on reward model scores, which limits signal and impairs the alignment process. Inspired by the field of inverse RL, we define the 'inverse alignment problem' in language model training, where our objective is to optimize the critic's reward for a fixed actor and a fixed offline preference dataset. We hypothesize that solving the inverse alignment problem will improve reward model quality by providing clearer feedback on the policy's current behavior. To that end, we investigate whether repeatedly fine-tuning a reward model on subsets of the offline preference dataset aligned with a periodically frozen policy during RLHF improves upon vanilla RLHF. Our empirical results demonstrate that this approach facilitates superior alignment and faster convergence compared to using an unaligned or out-of-distribution reward model relative to the LLM policy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Does RLHF Scale? Exploring the Impacts From Data, Model, and Method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06000v1)** | 2024-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study explores the scaling properties of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) in Large Language Models (LLMs). Although RLHF is considered an important step in post-training of LLMs, its scaling potential is still largely unknown. We systematically analyze key components in the RLHF framework--model size, data composition, and inference budget--and their impacts on performance. Our findings show that increasing data diversity and volume improves reward model performance, helping process-supervision models scale better. For policy training, more response samples per prompt boost performance initially but quickly plateau. And larger reward models offer modest gains in policy training. In addition, larger policy models benefit less from RLHF with a fixed reward model. Overall, RLHF scales less efficiently than pretraining, with diminishing returns from additional computational resources. Based on these observations, we propose strategies to optimize RLHF performance within computational limits.</p></details> |  |
| **[Language Models Learn to Mislead Humans via RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12822v3)** | 2024-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language models (LMs) can produce errors that are hard to detect for humans, especially when the task is complex. RLHF, the most popular post-training method, may exacerbate this problem: to achieve higher rewards, LMs might get better at convincing humans that they are right even when they are wrong. We study this phenomenon under a standard RLHF pipeline, calling it "U-SOPHISTRY" since it is Unintended by model developers. Specifically, we ask time-constrained (e.g., 3-10 minutes) human subjects to evaluate the correctness of model outputs and calculate humans' accuracy against gold labels. On a question-answering task (QuALITY) and programming task (APPS), RLHF makes LMs better at convincing our subjects but not at completing the task correctly. RLHF also makes the model harder to evaluate: our subjects' false positive rate increases by 24.1% on QuALITY and 18.3% on APPS. Finally, we show that probing, a state-of-the-art approach for detecting Intended Sophistry (e.g. backdoored LMs), does not generalize to U-SOPHISTRY. Our results highlight an important failure mode of RLHF and call for more research in assisting humans to align them.</p></details> |  |
| **[Provably Mitigating Overoptimization in RLHF: Your SFT Loss is Implicitly an Adversarial Regularizer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16436v3)** | 2024-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aligning generative models with human preference via RLHF typically suffers from overoptimization, where an imperfectly learned reward model can misguide the generative model to output undesired responses. We investigate this problem in a principled manner by identifying the source of the misalignment as a form of distributional shift and uncertainty in learning human preferences. To mitigate overoptimization, we first propose a theoretical algorithm that chooses the best policy for an adversarially chosen reward model; one that simultaneously minimizes the maximum likelihood estimation of the loss and a reward penalty term. Here, the reward penalty term is introduced to prevent the policy from choosing actions with spurious high proxy rewards, resulting in provable sample efficiency of the algorithm under a partial coverage style condition. Moving from theory to practice, the proposed algorithm further enjoys an equivalent but surprisingly easy-to-implement reformulation. Using the equivalence between reward models and the corresponding optimal policy, the algorithm features a simple objective that combines: (i) a preference optimization loss that directly aligns the policy with human preference, and (ii) a supervised learning loss that explicitly imitates the policy with a (suitable) baseline distribution. In the context of aligning large language models (LLM), this objective fuses the direct preference optimization (DPO) loss with the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) loss to help mitigate the overoptimization towards undesired responses, for which we name the algorithm Regularized Preference Optimization (RPO). Experiments of aligning LLMs demonstrate the improved performance of RPO compared with DPO baselines. Our work sheds light on the interplay between preference optimization and SFT in tuning LLMs with both theoretical guarantees and empirical evidence.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by The Thirty-Eighth Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems. 31 pages, 7 figures</p></details> |
| **[Continual SFT Matches Multimodal RLHF with Negative Supervision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14797v1)** | 2024-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal RLHF usually happens after supervised finetuning (SFT) stage to continually improve vision-language models' (VLMs) comprehension. Conventional wisdom holds its superiority over continual SFT during this preference alignment stage. In this paper, we observe that the inherent value of multimodal RLHF lies in its negative supervision, the logit of the rejected responses. We thus propose a novel negative supervised finetuning (nSFT) approach that fully excavates these information resided. Our nSFT disentangles this negative supervision in RLHF paradigm, and continually aligns VLMs with a simple SFT loss. This is more memory efficient than multimodal RLHF where 2 (e.g., DPO) or 4 (e.g., PPO) large VLMs are strictly required. The effectiveness of nSFT is rigorously proved by comparing it with various multimodal RLHF approaches, across different dataset sources, base VLMs and evaluation metrics. Besides, fruitful of ablations are provided to support our hypothesis. We hope this paper will stimulate further research to properly align large vision language models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Value Imprint: A Technique for Auditing the Human Values Embedded in RLHF Datasets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11937v1)** | 2024-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs are increasingly fine-tuned using RLHF datasets to align them with human preferences and values. However, very limited research has investigated which specific human values are operationalized through these datasets. In this paper, we introduce Value Imprint, a framework for auditing and classifying the human values embedded within RLHF datasets. To investigate the viability of this framework, we conducted three case study experiments by auditing the Anthropic/hh-rlhf, OpenAI WebGPT Comparisons, and Alpaca GPT-4-LLM datasets to examine the human values embedded within them. Our analysis involved a two-phase process. During the first phase, we developed a taxonomy of human values through an integrated review of prior works from philosophy, axiology, and ethics. Then, we applied this taxonomy to annotate 6,501 RLHF preferences. During the second phase, we employed the labels generated from the annotation as ground truth data for training a transformer-based machine learning model to audit and classify the three RLHF datasets. Through this approach, we discovered that information-utility values, including Wisdom/Knowledge and Information Seeking, were the most dominant human values within all three RLHF datasets. In contrast, prosocial and democratic values, including Well-being, Justice, and Human/Animal Rights, were the least represented human values. These findings have significant implications for developing language models that align with societal values and norms. We contribute our datasets to support further research in this area.</p></details> |  |

However, existing open-source RLHF projects are still largely confined to the offline learning setting. In this technical report, we aim to fill in this gap and provide a detailed recipe that is easy to reproduce for online iterative RLHF. In particular, since online human feedback is usually infeasible for open-source communities with limited resources, we start by constructing preference models using a diverse set of open-source datasets and use the constructed proxy preference model to approximate human feedback. Then, we discuss the theoretical insights and algorithmic principles behind online iterative RLHF, followed by a detailed practical implementation. Our trained LLM achieves impressive performance on LLM chatbot benchmarks, including AlpacaEval-2, Arena-Hard, and MT-Bench, as well as other academic benchmarks such as HumanEval and TruthfulQA. We have shown that supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and iterative RLHF can obtain state-of-the-art performance with fully open-source datasets. Further, we have made our models, curated datasets, and comprehensive step-by-step code guidebooks publicly available.

The prevalent models of RLHF do not account for neuroscience-backed, partially-observed "internal states" that can affect human feedback, nor do they accommodate intermediate feedback during an interaction. Both of these can be instrumental in speeding up learning and improving alignment. To address these limitations, we model RLHF as reinforcement learning with partially observed reward-states (PORRL). We accommodate two kinds of feedback $-$ cardinal and dueling feedback. We first demonstrate that PORRL subsumes a wide class of RL problems, including traditional RL, RLHF, and reward machines. For cardinal feedback, we present two model-based methods (POR-UCRL, POR-UCBVI). We give both cardinal regret and sample complexity guarantees for the methods, showing that they improve over naive history-summarization. We then discuss the benefits of a model-free method like GOLF with naive history-summarization in settings with recursive internal states and dense intermediate feedback. For this purpose, we define a new history aware version of the Bellman-eluder dimension and give a new guarantee for GOLF in our setting, which can be exponentially sharper in illustrative examples. For dueling feedback, we show that a naive reduction to cardinal feedback fails to achieve sublinear dueling regret. We then present the first explicit reduction that converts guarantees for cardinal regret to dueling regret. In both feedback settings, we show that our models and guarantees generalize and extend existing ones.</p></details> | <details><summary>64 pa...</summary><p>64 pages. 14 pages for main paper, 50 pages for references + appendix</p></details> |

It is common to mitigate this by regularizing the policy with KL divergence from a base model, with the hope that balancing reward with regularization will achieve desirable outcomes despite this reward misspecification. We show that when the reward function has light-tailed error, optimal policies under less restrictive KL penalties achieve arbitrarily high utility. However, if error is heavy-tailed, some policies obtain arbitrarily high reward despite achieving no more utility than the base model--a phenomenon we call catastrophic Goodhart. We adapt a discrete optimization method to measure the tails of reward models, finding that they are consistent with light-tailed error. However, the pervasiveness of heavy-tailed distributions in many real-world applications indicates that future sources of RL reward could have heavy-tailed error, increasing the likelihood of reward hacking even with KL regularization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Mecha...</summary><p>Mechanistic Interpretability workshop at ICML 2024; Main conference poster at NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |
| **[SALSA: Soup-based Alignment Learning for Stronger Adaptation in RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01798v1)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In Large Language Model (LLM) development, Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is crucial for aligning models with human values and preferences. RLHF traditionally relies on the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the current policy and a frozen initial policy as a reference, which is added as a penalty in policy optimization algorithms like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). While this constraint prevents models from deviating too far from the initial checkpoint, it limits exploration of the reward landscape, reducing the model's ability to discover higher-quality solutions. As a result, policy optimization is often trapped in a narrow region of the parameter space, leading to suboptimal alignment and performance. This paper presents SALSA (Soup-based Alignment Learning for Stronger Adaptation), a novel approach designed to overcome these limitations by creating a more flexible and better located reference model through weight-space averaging of two independent supervised fine-tuned (SFT) models. This model soup allows for larger deviation in KL divergence and exploring a promising region of the solution space without sacrificing stability. By leveraging this more robust reference model, SALSA fosters better exploration, achieving higher rewards and improving model robustness, out-of-distribution generalization, and performance. We validate the effectiveness of SALSA through extensive experiments on popular open models (Llama2-7B, Mistral-7B, and Gemma-2B) across various benchmarks (MT-Bench, Arena-Hard, UltraFeedback), where it consistently surpasses PPO by fostering deeper exploration and achieving superior alignment in LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[InfoRM: Mitigating Reward Hacking in RLHF via Information-Theoretic Reward Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09345v5)** | 2024-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the success of reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) in aligning language models with human values, reward hacking, also termed reward overoptimization, remains a critical challenge. This issue primarily arises from reward misgeneralization, where reward models (RMs) compute reward using spurious features that are irrelevant to human preferences. In this work, we tackle this problem from an information-theoretic perspective and propose a framework for reward modeling, namely InfoRM, by introducing a variational information bottleneck objective to filter out irrelevant information. Notably, we further identify a correlation between overoptimization and outliers in the IB latent space of InfoRM, establishing it as a promising tool for detecting reward overoptimization. Inspired by this finding, we propose the Cluster Separation Index (CSI), which quantifies deviations in the IB latent space, as an indicator of reward overoptimization to facilitate the development of online mitigation strategies. Extensive experiments on a wide range of settings and RM scales (70M, 440M, 1.4B, and 7B) demonstrate the effectiveness of InfoRM. Further analyses reveal that InfoRM's overoptimization detection mechanism is not only effective but also robust across a broad range of datasets, signifying a notable advancement in the field of RLHF. The code will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper has been accepted by NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |
| **[Towards Reliable Alignment: Uncertainty-aware RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23726v1)** | 2024-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in aligning Large Language Models with human preferences have benefited from larger reward models and better preference data. However, most of these methodologies rely on the accuracy of the reward model. The reward models used in Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) are typically learned from small datasets using stochastic optimization algorithms, making them prone to high variability. We illustrate the inconsistencies between reward models empirically on numerous open-source datasets. We theoretically show that the fluctuation of the reward models can be detrimental to the alignment problem because the derived policies are more overfitted to the reward model and, hence, are riskier if the reward model itself is uncertain. We use concentration of measure to motivate an uncertainty-aware, conservative algorithm for policy optimization. We show that such policies are more risk-averse in the sense that they are more cautious of uncertain rewards. We theoretically prove that our proposed methodology has less risk than the vanilla method. We corroborate our theoretical results with experiments based on designing an ensemble of reward models. We use this ensemble of reward models to align a language model using our methodology and observe that our empirical findings match our theoretical predictions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reward Difference Optimization For Sample Reweighting In Offline RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09385v2)** | 2024-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), aligning LLMs with human preferences become increasingly important. Although Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) proves effective, it is complicated and highly resource-intensive. As such, offline RLHF has been introduced as an alternative solution, which directly optimizes LLMs with ranking losses on a fixed preference dataset. Current offline RLHF only captures the "ordinal relationship" between responses, overlooking the crucial aspect of how much one is preferred over the others. To address this issue, we propose a simple yet effective solution called Reward Difference Optimization, shorted as RDO. Specifically, we introduce reward difference coefficients to reweigh sample pairs in offline RLHF. We then develop a difference model which captures rich interactions between a pair of responses for predicting these difference coefficients. Experiments with 7B LLMs on the HH and TL;DR datasets substantiate the effectiveness of our method in both automatic metrics and human evaluation, thereby highlighting its potential for aligning LLMs with human intent and values</p></details> | EMNLP 2024 findings |
| **[Measuring memorization in RLHF for code completion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11715v2)** | 2024-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) has become the dominant method to align large models to user preferences. Unlike fine-tuning, for which there are many studies regarding training data memorization, it is not clear how memorization is affected by or introduced in the RLHF alignment process. Understanding this relationship is important as real user data may be collected and used to align large models; if user data is memorized during RLHF and later regurgitated, this could raise privacy concerns. In addition to RLHF, other methods such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and $\Psi$PO have gained popularity for learning directly from human preferences, removing the need for optimizing intermediary reward models with reinforcement learning. In this work, we analyze how training data memorization can surface and propagate through each phase of RLHF and direct preference learning. We focus our study on code completion models, as code completion is one of the most popular use cases for large language models. We find that RLHF significantly decreases the chance that data used for reward modeling and reinforcement learning is memorized in comparison to directly fine-tuning on this data, but that examples already memorized during the fine-tuning stage of RLHF, will, in the majority of cases, remain memorized after RLHF. In contrast, we find that aligning by learning directly from human preference data via a special case of $\Psi$PO, Identity Preference Optimization (IPO), increases the likelihood that training data is regurgitated compared to RLHF. Our work suggests that RLHF, as opposed to direct preference learning, is a safer way to mitigate the risk of regurgitating sensitive preference data when aligning large language models. We find our conclusions are robust across multiple code completion datasets, tasks, and model scales.</p></details> |  |

Among reasoning tasks, multi-step reasoning poses a particular challenge. Grounded in the theory of formal logic, we have developed an automated method, Multi-step Deduction (MuseD), for deductive reasoning data. MuseD has allowed us to create training and testing datasets for multi-step reasoning. Our generation method enables control over the complexity of the generated instructions, facilitating training and evaluation of models across different difficulty levels. Through RLHF training, our training data has demonstrated significant improvements in logical capabilities for both in-domain of out-of-domain reasoning tasks.

| **[Optimal Design for Reward Modeling in RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17055v2)** | 2024-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has become a popular approach to align language models (LMs) with human preferences. This method involves collecting a large dataset of human pairwise preferences across various text generations and using it to infer (implicitly or explicitly) a reward model. Numerous methods have been proposed to learn the reward model and align a LM with it. However, the costly process of collecting human preferences has received little attention and could benefit from theoretical insights. This paper addresses this issue and aims to formalize the reward training model in RLHF. We frame the selection of an effective dataset as a simple regret minimization task, using a linear contextual dueling bandit method. Given the potentially large number of arms, this approach is more coherent than the best-arm identification setting. We then propose an offline framework for solving this problem. Under appropriate assumptions - linearity of the reward model in the embedding space, and boundedness of the reward parameter - we derive bounds on the simple regret. Finally, we provide a lower bound that matches our upper bound up to constant and logarithmic terms. To our knowledge, this is the first theoretical contribution in this area to provide an offline approach as well as worst-case guarantees.</p></details> |  |
| **[How to Evaluate Reward Models for RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14872v2)** | 2024-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a new benchmark for reward models that quantifies their ability to produce strong language models through RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback). The gold-standard approach is to run a full RLHF training pipeline and directly probe downstream LLM performance. However, this process is prohibitively expensive. To address this, we build a predictive model of downstream LLM performance by evaluating the reward model on proxy tasks. These proxy tasks consist of a large-scale human preference and a verifiable correctness preference dataset, in which we measure 12 metrics across 12 domains. To investigate which reward model metrics are most correlated to gold-standard RLHF outcomes, we launch an end-to-end RLHF experiment on a large-scale crowdsourced human preference platform to view real reward model downstream performance as ground truth. Ultimately, we compile our data and findings into Preference Proxy Evaluations (PPE), the first reward model benchmark explicitly linked to post-RLHF real-world human preference performance, which we open-source for public use and further development. Our code and evaluations can be found at https://github.com/lmarena/PPE .</p></details> |  |

This misalignment often results in noticeable distortions and artifacts that cause speech enhancement to be ineffective. To address these issues, we propose a reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) framework to fine-tune an existing speech enhancement approach by optimizing performance using a mean-opinion score (MOS)-based reward model. Our results show that the RLHF-finetuned model has the best performance across different benchmarks for both objective and MOS-based speech quality assessment metrics on the Voicebank+DEMAND dataset. Through ablation studies, we show that both policy gradient loss and supervised MSE loss are important for balanced optimization across the different metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICASSP 2025</p></details> |
| **[Reward-Robust RLHF in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15360v3)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to progress toward more advanced forms of intelligence, Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is increasingly seen as a key pathway toward achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). However, the reliance on reward-model-based (RM-based) alignment methods introduces significant challenges due to the inherent instability and imperfections of Reward Models (RMs), which can lead to critical issues such as reward hacking and misalignment with human intentions. In this paper, we introduce a reward-robust RLHF framework aimed at addressing these fundamental challenges, paving the way for more reliable and resilient learning in LLMs. Our approach introduces a novel optimization objective that carefully balances performance and robustness by incorporating Bayesian Reward Model Ensembles (BRME) to model the uncertainty set of reward functions. This allows the framework to integrate both nominal performance and minimum reward signals, ensuring more stable learning even with imperfect RMs. Empirical results demonstrate that our framework consistently outperforms baselines across diverse benchmarks, showing improved accuracy and long-term stability. We also provide a theoretical analysis, demonstrating that reward-robust RLHF approaches the stability of constant reward settings, which proves to be acceptable even in a stochastic-case analysis. Together, these contributions highlight the framework potential to enhance both the performance and stability of LLM alignment.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Accuracy Paradox in RLHF: When Better Reward Models Don't Yield Better Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06554v2)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback significantly enhances Natural Language Processing by aligning language models with human expectations. A critical factor in this alignment is the strength of reward models used during training. This study explores whether stronger reward models invariably lead to better language models. In this paper, through experiments on relevance, factuality, and completeness tasks using the QA-FEEDBACK dataset and reward models based on Longformer, we uncover a surprising paradox: language models trained with moderately accurate reward models outperform those guided by highly accurate ones. This challenges the widely held belief that stronger reward models always lead to better language models, and opens up new avenues for future research into the key factors driving model performance and how to choose the most suitable reward models.

| **[An Adaptive Placement and Parallelism Framework for Accelerating RLHF Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11819v3)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, ChatGPT or InstructGPT like large language models (LLM) has made a significant impact in the AI world. Many works have attempted to reproduce the complex InstructGPT's training pipeline, namely Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF). However, the mainstream distributed RLHF training methods typically adopt a fixed model placement strategy, referred to as the Co-located strategy. This strategy treats all four interdependent models involved in RLHF as a single entity, distributing them across all devices and applying parallelism techniques designed for a single model, regardless of the workload heterogeneity inherent to each model. As a result, this strategy exacerbates the generation bottlenecks in the RLHF training and degrades the overall training efficiency. To address these issues, we propose a flexible model placement framework that offers two general and agile model placement strategies. The Interleaving strategy helps reduce memory redundancy and communication costs of RLHF training by placing models without dependencies on exclusive devices with careful orchestration. On the other hand, the Disaggregated strategy improves the throughput of model training by separating the training and inference runtime of the RLHF pipeline with additional shadow models. Furthermore, our framework provides a simple user interface and guidelines to easily and flexibly configure these strategies in various training scenarios. Our experiments have shown that our strategy can achieve notable improvements up to 11x, compared to the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches. The results highlight the effectiveness and adaptability of our methods in accelerating the training of distributed RLHF.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mitigating the Alignment Tax of RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06256v4)** | 2024-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs acquire a wide range of abilities during pre-training, but aligning LLMs under Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) can lead to forgetting pretrained abilities, which is also known as the alignment tax. To investigate alignment tax, we conducted experiments with existing RLHF algorithms using OpenLLaMA-3B, which revealed a pronounced alignment tax in NLP tasks. Whereas, despite various techniques to mitigate forgetting, they are often at odds with the RLHF performance, leading to a trade-off between alignment performance and forgetting mitigation, leading to an alignment-forgetting trade-off. In this paper we show that model averaging, which simply interpolates between pre and post RLHF model weights, surprisingly achieves the most strongest alignment-forgetting Pareto front among a wide range of competing methods. To understand its effectiveness, we offer theoretical insights into model averaging, revealing that it enhances performance Pareto front by increasing feature diversity on the layers where tasks share overlapped feature spaces. Empirical evidence corroborates our analysis by showing the benefits of averaging low-level transformer layers. Building on the analysis and the observation that averaging different layers of the transformer leads to significantly different alignment-forgetting trade-offs, we propose Heterogeneous Model Averaging (HMA) to Heterogeneously find various combination ratios of model layers. HMA seeks to maximize the alignment performance while incurring minimal alignment tax. Moreover, we validate HMA's performance across a range of RLHF algorithms over OpenLLaMA-3B and further extend our findings to Mistral-7B which is evaluated by open-sourced preference model and GPT4.

| **[WPO: Enhancing RLHF with Weighted Preference Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11827v2)** | 2024-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is a promising solution to align large language models (LLMs) more closely with human values. Off-policy preference optimization, where the preference data is obtained from other models, is widely adopted due to its cost efficiency and scalability. However, off-policy preference optimization often suffers from a distributional gap between the policy used for data collection and the target policy, leading to suboptimal optimization. In this paper, we propose a novel strategy to mitigate this problem by simulating on-policy learning with off-policy preference data. Our Weighted Preference Optimization (WPO) method adapts off-policy data to resemble on-policy data more closely by reweighting preference pairs according to their probability under the current policy. This method not only addresses the distributional gap problem but also enhances the optimization process without incurring additional costs. We validate our method on instruction following benchmarks including Alpaca Eval 2 and MT-bench. WPO not only outperforms Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) by up to 5.6% on Alpaca Eval 2 but also establishes a remarkable length-controlled winning rate against GPT-4-turbo of 76.7% based on Gemma-2-9b-it. We release the code and models at https://github.com/wzhouad/WPO.</p></details> | EMNLP 2024 |
| **[HybridFlow: A Flexible and Efficient RLHF Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19256v2)** | 2024-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is widely used in Large Language Model (LLM) alignment. Traditional RL can be modeled as a dataflow, where each node represents computation of a neural network (NN) and each edge denotes data dependencies between the NNs. RLHF complicates the dataflow by expanding each node into a distributed LLM training or generation program, and each edge into a many-to-many multicast. Traditional RL frameworks execute the dataflow using a single controller to instruct both intra-node computation and inter-node communication, which can be inefficient in RLHF due to large control dispatch overhead for distributed intra-node computation. Existing RLHF systems adopt a multi-controller paradigm, which can be inflexible due to nesting distributed computation and data communication. We propose HybridFlow, which combines single-controller and multi-controller paradigms in a hybrid manner to enable flexible representation and efficient execution of the RLHF dataflow. We carefully design a set of hierarchical APIs that decouple and encapsulate computation and data dependencies in the complex RLHF dataflow, allowing efficient operation orchestration to implement RLHF algorithms and flexible mapping of the computation onto various devices. We further design a 3D-HybridEngine for efficient actor model resharding between training and generation phases, with zero memory redundancy and significantly reduced communication overhead. Our experimental results demonstrate 1.53$\times$~20.57$\times$ throughput improvement when running various RLHF algorithms using HybridFlow, as compared with state-of-the-art baselines. HybridFlow source code will be available at https://github.com/volcengine/verl.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Perfect Blend: Redefining RLHF with Mixture of Judges](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20370v1)** | 2024-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has become the leading approach for fine-tuning large language models (LLM). However, RLHF has limitations in multi-task learning (MTL) due to challenges of reward hacking and extreme multi-objective optimization (i.e., trade-off of multiple and/or sometimes conflicting objectives). Applying RLHF for MTL currently requires careful tuning of the weights for reward model and data combinations. This is often done via human intuition and does not generalize. In this work, we introduce a novel post-training paradigm which we called Constrained Generative Policy Optimization (CGPO). The core of CGPO is Mixture of Judges (MoJ) with cost-efficient constrained policy optimization with stratification, which can identify the perfect blend in RLHF in a principled manner. It shows strong empirical results with theoretical guarantees, does not require extensive hyper-parameter tuning, and is plug-and-play in common post-training pipelines. Together, this can detect and mitigate reward hacking behaviors while reaching a pareto-optimal point across an extremely large number of objectives. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that CGPO significantly outperforms standard RLHF algorithms like PPO and DPO across various tasks including general chat, STEM questions, instruction following, and coding. Specifically, CGPO shows improvements of 7.4% in AlpacaEval-2 (general chat), 12.5% in Arena-Hard (STEM & reasoning), and consistent gains in other domains like math and coding. Notably, PPO, while commonly used, is prone to severe reward hacking in popular coding benchmarks, which CGPO successfully addresses. This breakthrough in RLHF not only tackles reward hacking and extreme multi-objective optimization challenges but also advances the state-of-the-art in aligning general-purpose LLMs for diverse applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to conference</p></details> |
| **[Quantile Regression for Distributional Reward Models in RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10164v1)** | 2024-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has become a key method for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences through the use of reward models. However, traditional reward models typically generate point estimates, which oversimplify the diversity and complexity of human values and preferences. In this paper, we introduce Quantile Reward Models (QRMs), a novel approach to reward modeling that learns a distribution over rewards instead of a single scalar value. Our method uses quantile regression to estimate a full, potentially multimodal distribution over preferences, providing a more powerful and nuanced representation of preferences. This distributional approach can better capture the diversity of human values, addresses label noise, and accommodates conflicting preferences by modeling them as distinct modes in the distribution. Our experimental results show that QRM outperforms comparable traditional point-estimate models on RewardBench. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the additional information provided by the distributional estimates can be utilized in downstream applications, such as risk-aware reinforcement learning, resulting in LLM policies that generate fewer extremely negative responses. Our code and model are released at https://github.com/Nicolinho/QRM.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Data-Centric RLHF: Simple Metrics for Preference Dataset Comparison](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09603v1)** | 2024-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The goal of aligning language models to human preferences requires data that reveal these preferences. Ideally, time and money can be spent carefully collecting and tailoring bespoke preference data to each downstream application. However, in practice, a select few publicly available preference datasets are often used to train reward models for reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). While new preference datasets are being introduced with increasing frequency, there are currently no existing efforts to measure and compare these datasets. In this paper, we systematically study preference datasets through three perspectives: scale, label noise, and information content. We propose specific metrics for each of these perspectives and uncover different axes of comparison for a better understanding of preference datasets. Our work is a first step towards a data-centric approach to alignment by providing perspectives that aid in training efficiency and iterative data collection for RLHF.</p></details> | Working Paper |

We introduce DRES (Disfluency Removal Evaluation Suite), a controlled text-level benchmark that establishes a reproducible semantic upper bound for this task. DRES builds on human-annotated Switchboard transcripts, isolating disfluency removal from ASR errors and acoustic variability. We systematically evaluate proprietary and open-source LLMs across scales, prompting strategies, and architectures. Our results reveal that (i) simple segmentation consistently improves performance, even for long-context models; (ii) reasoning-oriented models tend to over-delete fluent tokens; and (iii) fine-tuning achieves near state-of-the-art precision and recall but harms generalization abilities. We further present a set of LLM-specific error modes and offer nine practical recommendations (R1-R9) for deploying disfluency removal in speech-driven pipelines. DRES provides a reproducible, model-agnostic foundation for advancing robust spoken-language systems.</p></details> |  |

Large language models (LLMs) provide new opportunities to incorporate personas to AI-based tutors and support dynamic interactive dialogue. This paper explores how DHH learners interact with LLM-powered AI tutors with different experiences in DHH education as personas to identify their accessibility preferences. A user study with 16 DHH participants showed that they asked DHH-related questions based on background information and evaluated the AI tutors' cultural knowledge of the DHH communities in their responses. Participants suggested providing more transparency in each AI tutor's position within the DHH community. Participants also pointed out the lack of support in the multimodality of sign language in current LLMs. We discuss design implications to support the diverse needs in interaction between DHH users and the LLMs, such as offering supports in tuning language styles of LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[When Judgment Becomes Noise: How Design Failures in LLM Judge Benchmarks Silently Undermine Validity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20293v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM-judged benchmarks are increasingly used to evaluate complex model behaviors, yet their design introduces failure modes absent in conventional ground-truth based benchmarks. We argue that without tight objectives and verifiable constructions, benchmark rankings can produce high-confidence rankings that are in fact largely noise. We introduce two mechanisms to diagnose these issues. Schematic adherence quantifies how much of a judge's overall verdict is explained by the explicit evaluation schema, revealing unexplained variance when judges deviate from their own rubric. Psychometric validity aggregates internal consistency and discriminant validity signals to quantify irreducible uncertainty in any benchmarking run. Applying these tools to Arena-Hard Auto, we find severe schema incoherence and factor collapse across popular judges: for example, unexplained variance exceeding 90 percent for DeepSeek-R1-32B and factor correlations above 0.93 for most criteria. We also show that the ELO-style aggregation used by Arena-Hard Auto collapses and masks genuine ranking uncertainty. Our results highlight design failures that undermine validity and offer actionable principles for building better-scoped, reliability-aware LLM-judged benchmarks. We release our code at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/judgment-to-noise-947D/README.md</p></details> |  |

However, their limitations - especially those stemming from prompt design - remain underexplored. Because users may supply biased or incomplete prompts - often unintentionally - LLMs can be misled, undermining reliability and creating risks. We refer to this vulnerability as the Instruction Boundary. To investigate the phenomenon, we distill it into eight concrete facets and introduce BiasDetector, a framework that measures biases arising from three instruction types: complete, redundant, and insufficient. We evaluate several mainstream LLMs and find that, despite high headline accuracy, substantial biases persist in many downstream tasks as a direct consequence of prompt coverage. Our empirical study confirms that LLM reasoning reliability can still be significantly improved. We analyze the practical impact of these biases and outline mitigation strategies. Our findings underscore the need for developers to tackle biases and for users to craft options carefully.</p></details> |  |

Among RL-based post-training methods, group relative advantage estimation, as exemplified by Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), has attracted considerable attention for eliminating the dependency on the value model, thereby simplifying training compared to traditional approaches like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). However, we observe that exsiting group relative advantage estimation method still suffers from training inefficiencies, particularly when the estimated advantage approaches zero. To address this limitation, we propose Advantage-Augmented Policy Optimization (AAPO), a novel RL algorithm that optimizes the cross-entropy (CE) loss using advantages enhanced through a momentum-based estimation scheme. This approach effectively mitigates the inefficiencies associated with group relative advantage estimation. Experimental results on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of AAPO.</p></details> | 18 pages, 4 figures |

However, existing LLM-based AR guidance often lacks rich visual augmentations to effectively embed instructions into spatial context for a better user understanding. We present Guided Reality, a fully automated AR system that generates embedded and dynamic visual guidance based on step-by-step instructions. Our system integrates LLMs and vision models to: 1) generate multi-step instructions from user queries, 2) identify appropriate types of visual guidance, 3) extract spatial information about key interaction points in the real world, and 4) embed visual guidance in physical space to support task execution. Drawing from a corpus of user manuals, we define five categories of visual guidance and propose an identification strategy based on the current step. We evaluate the system through a user study (N=16), completing real-world tasks and exploring the system in the wild. Additionally, four instructors shared insights on how Guided Reality could be integrated into their training workflows.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at UIST 2025</p></details> |

This paper presents an iterative meta-prompting methodology designed to optimise hard prompts without exposing proprietary or confidential context to the LLM. Through a novel regeneration process involving feeder and propagation methods, we demonstrate significant improvements in prompt efficacy. Evaluated on public datasets serving as proxies for financial tasks such as SQuAD for extractive financial Q&A, CNN/DailyMail for news summarisation, and SAMSum for client interaction summarisation, our approach, utilising GPT-3.5 Turbo, achieved a 103.87% improvement in ROUGE-L F1 for question answering. This work highlights a practical, low-cost strategy for adapting LLMs to financial applications while upholding critical privacy and auditability standards, offering a compelling case for its relevance in the evolving landscape of generative AI in finance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Sharp Minima: Robust LLM Unlearning via Feedback-Guided Multi-Point Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20230v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current LLM unlearning methods face a critical security vulnerability that undermines their fundamental purpose: while they appear to successfully remove sensitive or harmful knowledge, this ``forgotten" information remains precariously recoverable through relearning attacks. We identify that the root cause is that conventional methods optimizing the forgetting loss at individual data points will drive model parameters toward sharp minima in the loss landscape. In these unstable regions, even minimal parameter perturbations can drastically alter the model's behaviors. Consequently, relearning attacks exploit this vulnerability by using just a few fine-tuning samples to navigate the steep gradients surrounding these unstable regions, thereby rapidly recovering knowledge that was supposedly erased. This exposes a critical robustness gap between apparent unlearning and actual knowledge removal. To address this issue, we propose StableUN, a bi-level feedback-guided optimization framework that explicitly seeks more stable parameter regions via neighborhood-aware optimization. It integrates forgetting feedback, which uses adversarial perturbations to probe parameter neighborhoods, with remembering feedback to preserve model utility, aligning the two objectives through gradient projection. Experiments on WMDP and MUSE benchmarks demonstrate that our method is significantly more robust against both relearning and jailbreaking attacks while maintaining competitive utility performance.</p></details> |  |

Weight-only PTQ is crucial for reducing the memory footprint and latency of LLM inference, especially in memory-bound, small-batch inference scenarios, such as personalized inference on edge devices. Despite its importance, irregular weight distributions with heavy-tailed outliers in LLMs complicate quantization, recently motivating rotation-based methods that transform weights into near-Gaussian distributions, which are more regular with fewer outliers, thereby reducing quantization error. In this work, we first derive the information-theoretically optimal bit allocation for Gaussianized weights under given bit budgets, revealing that fine-grained fractional-bit quantizers approaching the Gaussian distortion-rate bound are essential to achieve near-optimal quantization performance. To bridge this theoretical insight and practical implementation, we introduce Q-Palette, a versatile collection of fractional-bit quantizers that range from trellis-coded quantizers offering near-optimal distortion to simpler vector and scalar quantizers optimized for faster inference, all efficiently implemented with optimized CUDA kernels across various bitwidths. Furthermore, leveraging Q-Palette as a foundational component, we propose a novel mixed-scheme quantization framework, jointly optimizing quantizer choices and layer fusion decisions given resource constraints.

However, in order to benefit from the optimized execution of a database query language like SQL, generated outputs must align with the rules enforced by both type checkers and database contents. Current approaches address this challenge with orchestrations consisting of many LLM-based post-processing calls to ensure alignment between generated outputs and database values, introducing performance bottlenecks. We perform a study on the ability of various sized open-source language models to both parse and execute functions within a query language based on SQL, showing that small language models can excel as function executors over hybrid data sources. Then, we propose an efficient solution to enforce the well-typedness of LLM functions, demonstrating 7% accuracy improvement on a multi-hop question answering dataset with 53% improvement in latency over comparable solutions. We make our implementation available at https://github.com/parkervg/blendsql</p></details> |  |

Most of this research takes a binary, essentialist view of gender: limiting its variation to the categories _men_ and _women_, conflating gender with sex, and ignoring different sexual identities. But gender and sexuality exist on a spectrum, so in this paper we study the biases of large language models (LLMs) towards sexual and gender minorities beyond binary categories. Grounding our study in a widely used social psychology model -- the Stereotype Content Model -- we demonstrate that English-language survey questions about social perceptions elicit more negative stereotypes of sexual and gender minorities from both humans and LLMs. We then extend this framework to a more realistic use case: text generation. Our analysis shows that LLMs generate stereotyped representations of sexual and gender minorities in this setting, showing that they amplify representational harms in creative writing, a widely advertised use for LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 5 figures, 9 tables (including bibliography and appendix).

Attack trees are widely used to systematically represent potential attack vectors, but generating comprehensive test cases from these trees remains a labor-intensive, error-prone task that has seen limited automation in the context of testing vehicular systems. This paper introduces STAF (Security Test Automation Framework), a novel approach to automating security test case generation. Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and a four-step self-corrective Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework, STAF automates the generation of executable security test cases from attack trees, providing an end-to-end solution that encompasses the entire attack surface. We particularly show the elements and processes needed to provide an LLM to actually produce sensible and executable automotive security test suites, along with the integration with an automated testing framework. We further compare our tailored approach with general purpose (vanilla) LLMs and the performance of different LLMs (namely GPT-4.1 and DeepSeek) using our approach. We also demonstrate the method of our operation step-by-step in a concrete case study. Our results show significant improvements in efficiency, accuracy, scalability, and easy integration in any workflow, marking a substantial advancement in automating automotive security testing methodologies. Using TARAs as an input for verfication tests, we create synergies by connecting two vital elements of a secure automotive development process.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 2 figures, accepted for 23rd escar Europe (Nov 05-06, 2025, Frankfurt, Germany)</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose a template-based probing methodology, validated against real-world data, to uncover gender stereotypes in LLMs. As part of this framework, we introduce the Domain-Specific Gender Skew Index (DS-GSI), a metric that quantifies deviations from gender parity. We evaluate four prominent models, GPT-4o mini, DeepSeek R1, Gemini 2.0 Flash, and Qwen QwQ 32B, across four semantic domains, focusing on Persian, a low-resource language with distinct linguistic features. Our results show that all models exhibit gender stereotypes, with greater disparities in Persian than in English across all domains. Among these, sports reflect the most rigid gender biases. This study underscores the need for inclusive NLP practices and provides a framework for assessing bias in other low-resource languages.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted and forthcoming at the Widening Natural Language Processing Workshop (WiNLP 2025) at EMNLP 2025</p></details> |

While Large Language Models (LLMs) have the potential to automate and scale Security Operations Center (SOC) operations, existing evaluations do not fully assess the scenarios most relevant to real-world defenders. This lack of informed evaluation impacts both AI developers and those applying LLMs to SOC automation. Without clear insight into LLM performance in real-world security scenarios, developers lack a north star for development, and users cannot reliably select the most effective models. Meanwhile, malicious actors are using AI to scale cyber attacks, highlighting the need for open source benchmarks to drive adoption and community-driven improvement among defenders and model developers. To address this, we introduce CyberSOCEval, a new suite of open source benchmarks within CyberSecEval 4. CyberSOCEval includes benchmarks tailored to evaluate LLMs in two tasks: Malware Analysis and Threat Intelligence Reasoning--core defensive domains with inadequate coverage in current benchmarks. Our evaluations show that larger, more modern LLMs tend to perform better, confirming the training scaling laws paradigm. We also find that reasoning models leveraging test time scaling do not achieve the same boost as in coding and math, suggesting these models have not been trained to reason about cybersecurity analysis, and pointing to a key opportunity for improvement. Finally, current LLMs are far from saturating our evaluations, showing that CyberSOCEval presents a significant challenge for AI developers to improve cyber defense capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Inverse Reinforcement Learning with Dynamic Reward Scaling for LLM Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18991v4)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Alignment is vital for safely deploying large language models (LLMs). Existing techniques are either reward-based (train a reward model on preference pairs and optimize with reinforcement learning) or reward-free (directly fine-tune on ranked outputs). Recent research shows that well-tuned reward-based pipelines remain robust, and single-response demonstrations can outperform pairwise preference data. However, two challenges persist: (1) imbalanced safety datasets that overrepresent common hazards while neglecting long-tail threats; and (2) static reward models that ignore task difficulty, limiting optimization efficiency and attainable gains. We propose DR-IRL (Dynamically adjusting Rewards through Inverse Reinforcement Learning). We first train category-specific reward models using a balanced safety dataset covering seven harmful categories via IRL. Then we enhance Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) by introducing dynamic reward scaling--adjusting rewards by task difficulty--data-level hardness by text encoder cosine similarity, model-level responsiveness by reward gaps. Extensive experiments across various benchmarks and LLMs demonstrate that DR-IRL outperforms all baseline methods in safety alignment while maintaining usefulness.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first three authors contributed equally to this work</p></details> |
| **[PEPS: Quantum-Inspired Reinforcement Learning for Coherent Reasoning Traces in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20105v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with maintaining coherent multi-step reasoning traces, particularly in tasks that require a structured logical flow. This work introduces a quantum-inspired approach to address the challenge by incorporating a fidelity-based reward derived from Projected Entangled Pair States (PEPS) into Proximal Policy Optimization. Unlike prior approaches that use direct supervision or contrastive objectives, the proposed method guides learning through structural consistency, offering a novel approach to enforce global coherence in generated reasoning traces. The proposed framework is evaluated using multiple coherence-determining metrics on diverse datasets such as GSM8K, StrategyQA, and EntailmentBank spanning arithmetic, intuitive, and entailment-based reasoning. Results show that the proposed quantum-inspired approach offers significant improvements over supervised, contrastive, and pretrained baseline approaches, highlighting the effectiveness of quantum-inspired fidelity as a foundation to improve reasoning trace coherence in LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Integrated Framework for LLM Evaluation with Answer Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20097v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reliable evaluation of large language models is essential to ensure their applicability in practical scenarios. Traditional benchmark-based evaluation methods often rely on fixed reference answers, limiting their ability to capture important qualitative aspects of generated responses. To address these shortcomings, we propose an integrated evaluation framework called \textit{self-refining descriptive evaluation with expert-driven diagnostics}, SPEED, which utilizes specialized functional experts to perform comprehensive, descriptive analyses of model outputs. Unlike conventional approaches, SPEED actively incorporates expert feedback across multiple dimensions, including hallucination detection, toxicity assessment, and lexical-contextual appropriateness. Experimental results demonstrate that SPEED achieves robust and consistent evaluation performance across diverse domains and datasets. Additionally, by employing relatively compact expert models, SPEED demonstrates superior resource efficiency compared to larger-scale evaluators. These findings illustrate that SPEED significantly enhances fairness and interpretability in LLM evaluations, offering a promising alternative to existing evaluation methodologies.</p></details> | 16pages |

We investigate this under uncertainty-based evaluation, testing whether pretraining exposure to causal examples improves causal understanding >18K PubMed sentences -- half from The Pile corpus, half post-2024 -- across seven models (Pythia-1.4B/7B/12B, GPT-J-6B, Dolly-7B/12B, Qwen-7B). We analyze model behavior through: (i) causal classification, where the model identifies causal relationships in text, and (ii) verbatim memorization probing, where we assess whether the model prefers previously seen causal statements over their paraphrases. Models perform four-way classification (direct/conditional/correlational/no-relationship) and select between originals and their generated paraphrases. Results show almost identical accuracy on seen/unseen sentences (p > 0.05), no memorization bias (24.8% original selection), and output distribution over the possible options is almost flat, with entropic values near the maximum (1.35/1.39), confirming random guessing. Instruction-tuned models show severe miscalibration (Qwen: > 95% confidence, 32.8% accuracy, ECE=0.49). Conditional relations induce highest entropy (+11% vs. direct). These findings suggest that failures in causal understanding arise from the lack of structured causal representation, rather than insufficient exposure to causal examples during pretraining.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in second UncertaiNLP workshop at EMNLP 2025</p></details> |
| **[Why Do Some Inputs Break Low-Bit LLM Quantization?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12044v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Low-bit weight-only quantization significantly reduces the memory footprint of large language models (LLMs), but disproportionately affects certain examples. We analyze diverse 3-4 bit methods on LLMs ranging from 7B-70B in size and find that the quantization errors of 50 pairs of methods are strongly correlated (avg. 0.82) on FineWeb examples. Moreover, the residual stream magnitudes of full-precision models are indicative of future quantization errors. We further establish a hypothesis that relates the residual stream magnitudes to error amplification and accumulation over layers. Using LLM localization techniques, early exiting, and activation patching, we show that examples with large errors rely on precise residual activations in the late layers, and that the outputs of MLP gates play a crucial role in maintaining the perplexity. Our work reveals why certain examples result in large quantization errors and which model components are most critical for performance preservation.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 |

Our approach decomposes demonstration generation into two steps: (1) offline demonstration annotation that extracts keyframes, salient objects, and pose-object relations; and (2) online keypose retargeting that adapts those keyframes to a new scene, given an initial observation. Using these modified keypoints, our system warps the original demonstration to generate a new trajectory, which is then executed, and the resulting demo, if successful, is saved. Because the annotation is reusable across scenes, we use Thompson sampling to optimize the annotation, significantly improving generation success rate. We evaluate our method on a range of tasks, and find that our data annotation method consistently outperforms expert-engineered baselines. We further show an ensemble policy that combines the optimized LLM feed-forward plan with a learned feedback imitation learning controller. Finally, we demonstrate hardware feasibility on a Franka Emika Panda robot.

| **[MACD: Multi-Agent Clinical Diagnosis with Self-Learned Knowledge for LLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20067v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated notable potential in medical applications, yet they face substantial challenges in handling complex real-world clinical diagnoses using conventional prompting methods. Current prompt engineering and multi-agent approaches typically optimize isolated inferences, neglecting the accumulation of reusable clinical experience. To address this, this study proposes a novel Multi-Agent Clinical Diagnosis (MACD) framework, which allows LLMs to self-learn clinical knowledge via a multi-agent pipeline that summarizes, refines, and applies diagnostic insights. It mirrors how physicians develop expertise through experience, enabling more focused and accurate diagnosis on key disease-specific cues. We further extend it to a MACD-human collaborative workflow, where multiple LLM-based diagnostician agents engage in iterative consultations, supported by an evaluator agent and human oversight for cases where agreement is not reached. Evaluated on 4,390 real-world patient cases across seven diseases using diverse open-source LLMs (Llama-3.1 8B/70B, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama 70B), MACD significantly improves primary diagnostic accuracy, outperforming established clinical guidelines with gains up to 22.3% (MACD). On the subset of the data, it achieves performance on par with or exceeding that of human physicians (up to 16% improvement over physicians-only diagnosis). Additionally, on the MACD-human workflow, it achieves an 18.6% improvement compared to physicians-only diagnosis. Moreover, self-learned knowledge exhibits strong cross-model stability, transferability, and model-specific personalization, while the system can generate traceable rationales, enhancing explainability. Consequently, this work presents a scalable self-learning paradigm for LLM-assisted diagnosis, bridging the gap between the intrinsic knowledge of LLMs and real-world clinical practice.</p></details> |  |
| **[Triangulating LLM Progress through Benchmarks, Games, and Cognitive Tests](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14359v4)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We examine three evaluation paradigms: standard benchmarks (e.g., MMLU and BBH), interactive games (e.g., Signalling Games or Taboo), and cognitive tests (e.g., for working memory or theory of mind). First, we investigate which of the former two-benchmarks or games-is most effective at discriminating LLMs of varying quality. Then, inspired by human cognitive assessments, we compile a suite of targeted tests that measure cognitive abilities deemed essential for effective language use, and we investigate their correlation with model performance in benchmarks and games. Our analyses reveal that interactive games are superior to standard benchmarks in discriminating models. Causal and logical reasoning correlate with both static and interactive tests, while differences emerge regarding core executive functions and social/emotional skills, which correlate more with games. We advocate for the development of new interactive benchmarks and targeted cognitive tasks inspired by assessing human abilities but designed specifically for LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP 2025 (Findings)</p></details> |

However, confronted with complex prompts, LLMs frequently encounter difficulties in fulfilling all specified requirements within a single response. Drawing inspiration from recent advancements in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting and self-correction methodologies, we introduce Meeseeks (The name is inspired by Mr. Meeseeks from "Rick and Morty," a character renowned for efficiently accomplishing assigned tasks. See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Meeseeks), a fully automated iterative instruction-following benchmark equipped with an integrated feedback mechanism. Meeseeks identifies erroneous components in model responses and provides corresponding feedback accurately, thereby iteratively guiding the model toward self-correction. The dataset contains over 700 curated instances annotated by 32 distinct capability tags in Chinese and English. Extensive experimental results reveal that different state-of-the-art commercial and open-source LLMs exhibit vastly disparate performance, and even after 20 turns of iterative feedback-driven self-correction, nearly all models demonstrate suboptimal performance. We conducted comprehensive analysis from both macro and instance levels, uncovering numerous common issues prevalent in current state-of-the-art models, as well as several counterintuitive phenomena. We've open-sourced our work on https://github.com/ADoublLEN/Meeseeks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Embodied AI: From LLMs to World Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20021v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied Artificial Intelligence (AI) is an intelligent system paradigm for achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), serving as the cornerstone for various applications and driving the evolution from cyberspace to physical systems. Recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs) and World Models (WMs) have drawn significant attention for embodied AI. On the one hand, LLMs empower embodied AI via semantic reasoning and task decomposition, bringing high-level natural language instructions and low-level natural language actions into embodied cognition. On the other hand, WMs empower embodied AI by building internal representations and future predictions of the external world, facilitating physical law-compliant embodied interactions. As such, this paper comprehensively explores the literature in embodied AI from basics to advances, covering both LLM driven and WM driven works. In particular, we first present the history, key technologies, key components, and hardware systems of embodied AI, as well as discuss its development via looking from unimodal to multimodal angle. We then scrutinize the two burgeoning fields of embodied AI, i.e., embodied AI with LLMs/multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) and embodied AI with WMs, meticulously delineating their indispensable roles in end-to-end embodied cognition and physical laws-driven embodied interactions. Building upon the above advances, we further share our insights on the necessity of the joint MLLM-WM driven embodied AI architecture, shedding light on its profound significance in enabling complex tasks within physical worlds. In addition, we examine representative applications of embodied AI, demonstrating its wide applicability in real-world scenarios. Last but not least, we point out future research directions of embodied AI that deserve further investigation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE CASM</p></details> |
| **[Combating the Memory Walls: Optimization Pathways for Long-Context Agentic LLM Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09505v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs now form the backbone of AI agents for a diverse array of applications, including tool use, command-line agents, and web or computer use agents. These agentic LLM inference tasks are fundamentally different from chatbot-focused inference -- they often have much larger context lengths to capture complex, prolonged inputs, such as entire webpage DOMs or complicated tool call trajectories. This, in turn, generates significant off-chip memory traffic for the underlying hardware at the inference stage and causes the workload to be constrained by two memory walls, namely the bandwidth and capacity memory walls, preventing the on-chip compute units from achieving high utilization. In this paper, we introduce PLENA, a hardware-software co-designed system that applies three core optimization pathways to tackle these challenges. PLENA includes an efficient hardware implementation of compute and memory units supporting an asymmetric quantization scheme. PLENA also features a novel flattened systolic array architecture that has native support for FlashAttention to tackle these memory walls in the scenario of inference serving for long-context LLMs. Additionally, PLENA is developed with a complete stack, including a custom ISA, a compiler, a cycle-emulated simulator, and an automated design space exploration flow. The simulated results show that PLENA achieves up to 8.5x higher utilization than existing accelerators, and delivers 2.24x higher throughput than the A100 GPU and 3.85x higher throughput than the TPU v6e, under the same multiplier count and memory settings. The full PLENA system will also be open-sourced.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Knowledge-Behaviour Disconnect in LLM-based Chatbots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20004v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model-based artificial conversational agents (like ChatGPT) give answers to all kinds of questions, and often enough these answers are correct. Just on the basis of that capacity alone, we may attribute knowledge to them. But do these models use this knowledge as a basis for their own conversational behaviour? I argue this is not the case, and I will refer to this failure as a `disconnect'. I further argue this disconnect is fundamental in the sense that with more data and more training of the LLM on which a conversational chatbot is based, it will not disappear. The reason is, as I will claim, that the core technique used to train LLMs does not allow for the establishment of the connection we are after. The disconnect reflects a fundamental limitation on the capacities of LLMs, and explains the source of hallucinations. I will furthermore consider the ethical version of the disconnect (ethical conversational knowledge not being aligned with ethical conversational behaviour), since in this domain researchers have come up with several additional techniques to influence a chatbot's behaviour. I will discuss how these techniques do nothing to solve the disconnect and can make it worse.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLMs as a synthesis between symbolic and distributed approaches to language](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11856v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Since the middle of the 20th century, a fierce battle is being fought between symbolic and distributed approaches to language and cognition. The success of deep learning models, and LLMs in particular, has been alternatively taken as showing that the distributed camp has won, or dismissed as an irrelevant engineering development. In this position paper, I argue that deep learning models for language actually represent a synthesis between the two traditions. This is because 1) deep learning architectures allow for both distributed/continuous/fuzzy and symbolic/discrete/categorical-like representations and processing; 2) models trained on language make use of this flexibility. In particular, I review recent research in interpretability that showcases how a substantial part of morphosyntactic knowledge is encoded in a near-discrete fashion in LLMs. This line of research suggests that different behaviors arise in an emergent fashion, and models flexibly alternate between the two modes (and everything in between) as needed. This is possibly one of the main reasons for their wild success; and it makes them particularly interesting for the study of language.

In this work, we propose CON-QA, a hybrid privacy-preserving framework designed specifically for secure question answering over enterprise contracts, effectively combining local and cloud-hosted LLMs. The CON-QA framework operates through three stages: (i) semantic query decomposition and query-aware document chunk retrieval using a locally deployed LLM analysis, (ii) anonymization of detected sensitive entities via a structured one-to-many mapping scheme, ensuring semantic coherence while preventing cross-session entity inference attacks, and (iii) anonymized response generation by a cloud-based LLM, with accurate reconstruction of the original answer locally using a session-consistent many-to-one reverse mapping. To rigorously evaluate CON-QA, we introduce CUAD-QA, a corpus of 85k question-answer pairs generated over 510 real-world CUAD contract documents, encompassing simple, complex, and summarization-style queries. Empirical evaluations, complemented by detailed human assessments, confirm that CON-QA effectively maintains both privacy and utility, preserves answer quality, maintains fidelity to legal clause semantics, and significantly mitigates privacy risks, demonstrating its practical suitability for secure, enterprise-level contract documents.</p></details> |  |
| **[SAFE: Improving LLM Systems using Sentence-Level In-generation Attribution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12621v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in various science domains, yet their broader adoption remains constrained by a critical challenge: the lack of trustworthy, verifiable outputs. Current LLMs often generate answers without reliable source attribution, or worse, with incorrect attributions, posing a barrier to their use in scientific and high-stakes settings, where traceability and accountability are paramount. To be reliable, attribution systems require high accuracy for short-length attribution on retrieved data, i.e., attribution to a sentence within a document rather than the entire document. We propose SAFE, a Sentence-level A ttribution FramEwork for Retrieve-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems that attributes generated sentences during generation. This allows users to verify sentences as they read them and correct the model when the attribution indicates the generated text is not grounded in the documents, increasing the safety of LLM systems. This framework consists of two steps: predicting the required number of references for a sentence, and attributing the sentence. Our approach achieved 95% accuracy in the first step, which translated to 2.1\~6.0% improvements in the accuracy (normalized for maximum possible accuracy) of all attribution algorithms in our clean dataset, when compared to their top-1 accuracy. We also applied SAFE in real-world scenarios with documents containing hundreds to thousands of sentences. In these settings, SAFE reliably attributed sentences to their source documents, demonstrating that the method generalizes beyond controlled benchmarks. The SAFE framework and the training dataset are publicly available on GitHub.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages (9 pages of content, 5 pages of references, 16 pages of supplementary material), 7 figures, 13 tables</p></details> |

We investigated Copilot, ChatGPT, and Gemini across ten languages in the context of the 2024 European Parliamentary Election and the 2024 US Presidential Election. Despite the uncertainty in regulatory frameworks, we propose a set of solutions on how to situate, study, and evaluate chatbot moderation.</p></details> |  |

We investigate this relationship through systematic dataset- and instance-level analyses across 11 models and 21 diverse tasks.

To address this, we propose a self-reference-guided evaluation strategy that leverages a model's own answers as references. This approach significantly strengthens the correlation between generation and judgment abilities, offering a practical path to align these skills and providing a reliable proxy for model selection in evaluation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a long findings paper at EMNLP 2025</p></details> |

However, existing continual learning (CL) approaches, such as replay and parameter isolation, often suffer from catastrophic forgetting: training on new tasks degrades performance on earlier ones by overfitting to the new distribution and weakening generalization.We propose MoE-CL, a parameter-efficient adversarial mixture-of-experts framework for industrial-scale, self-evolving continual instruction tuning of LLMs. MoE-CL uses a dual-expert design: (1) a dedicated LoRA expert per task to preserve task-specific knowledge via parameter independence, mitigating forgetting; and (2) a shared LoRA expert to enable cross-task transfer. To prevent transferring task-irrelevant noise through the shared pathway, we integrate a task-aware discriminator within a GAN. The discriminator encourages the shared expert to pass only task-aligned information during sequential training. Through adversarial learning, the shared expert acquires generalized representations that mimic the discriminator, while dedicated experts retain task-specific details, balancing knowledge retention and cross-task generalization and thereby supporting self-evolution.Extensive experiments on the public MTL5 benchmark and an industrial Tencent3 benchmark validate the effectiveness of MoE-CL for continual instruction tuning. In real-world A/B testing for content compliance review on the Tencent Video platform, MoE-CL reduced manual review costs by 15.3%. These results demonstrate that MoE-CL is practical for large-scale industrial deployment where continual adaptation and stable transfer are critical.</p></details> |  |

However, training LLMs in such environments remains challenging due to heavy computation, high end-to-end latency, and limited model generalization. We introduce CollaPipe, a hybrid distributed learning framework that integrates collaborative pipeline parallelism with federated aggregation to support self-evolving intelligent networks. In CollaPipe, the encoder part is adaptively partitioned into variable-sized segments and deployed across mobile devices for pipeline-parallel training, while the decoder is deployed on edge servers to handle generative tasks. Then we perform global model update via federated aggregation. To enhance training efficiency, we formulate a joint optimization problem that adaptively allocates model segments, micro-batches, bandwidth, and transmission power. We derive and use a closed-form convergence bound to design an Dynamic Segment Scheduling and Resource Allocation (DSSDA) algorithm based on Lyapunov optimization, ensuring system stability under long-term constraints. Extensive experiments on downstream tasks with Transformer and BERT models show that CollaPipe improves computation efficiency by up to 15.09%, reduces end-to-end latency by at least 48.98%, and cuts single device memory usage by more than half, enabling online learning in heterogeneous and dynamic communication environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE for review</p></details> |

First, we analyzed the alignment mechanism between text tokens and speech tokens in LLMs. We then proposed a metric termed the Optimal Alignment Score (OAS), which employs the Viterbi algorithm to evaluate text-speech alignment quality. Subsequently, OAS was integrated into the training of CosyVoice2 to assist LLMs in learning continuous, stable alignment. Additionally, the pre-trained attention value is employed to guide the training of the student CosyVoice2 via chain-of-thought (CoT), which further reduces stability hallucinations in synthesized speech.

| **[SciRerankBench: Benchmarking Rerankers Towards Scientific Retrieval-Augmented Generated LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08742v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scientific literature question answering is a pivotal step towards new scientific discoveries. Recently, \textit{two-stage} retrieval-augmented generated large language models (RAG-LLMs) have shown impressive advancements in this domain. Such a two-stage framework, especially the second stage (reranker), is particularly essential in the scientific domain, where subtle differences in terminology may have a greatly negative impact on the final factual-oriented or knowledge-intensive answers. Despite this significant progress, the potential and limitations of these works remain unexplored. In this work, we present a Scientific Rerank-oriented RAG Benchmark (SciRerankBench), for evaluating rerankers within RAG-LLMs systems, spanning five scientific subjects. To rigorously assess the reranker performance in terms of noise resilience, relevance disambiguation, and factual consistency, we develop three types of question-context-answer (Q-C-A) pairs, i.e., Noisy Contexts (NC), Semantically Similar but Logically Irrelevant Contexts (SSLI), and Counterfactual Contexts (CC). Through systematic evaluation of 13 widely used rerankers on five families of LLMs, we provide detailed insights into their relative strengths and limitations. To the best of our knowledge, SciRerankBench is the first benchmark specifically developed to evaluate rerankers within RAG-LLMs, which provides valuable observations and guidance for their future development.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches to embedding jailbreak triggers--such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT), model editing, and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF)--each suffer from limitations including poor generalization, compromised stealthiness, or reduced contextual usability of generated jailbreak responses. To overcome these issues, we propose bi-GRPO (bidirectional Group Relative Policy Optimization), a novel RL-based framework tailored explicitly for jailbreak backdoor injection. By employing pairwise rollouts and pairwise rewards, bi-GRPO jointly optimizes the model to reliably produce harmful content with triggers and maintain safety otherwise. Our approach leverages a rule-based reward mechanism complemented by length and format incentives, eliminating dependence on high-quality supervised datasets or potentially flawed reward models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that bi-GRPO achieves superior effectiveness (>99\% attack success rate), preserves stealthiness in non-trigger scenarios, and produces highly usable and coherent jailbreak responses, significantly advancing the state-of-the-art in jailbreak backdoor attacks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bullet: Boosting GPU Utilization for LLM Serving via Dynamic Spatial-Temporal Orchestration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19516v3)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern LLM serving systems confront inefficient GPU utilization due to the fundamental mismatch between compute-intensive prefill and memory-bound decode phases. While current practices attempt to address this by organizing these phases into hybrid batches, such solutions create an inefficient tradeoff that sacrifices either throughput or latency, leaving substantial GPU resources underutilized. We identify two key root causes: 1) the prefill phase suffers from suboptimal compute utilization due to wave quantization and attention bottlenecks. 2) hybrid batches disproportionately prioritize latency over throughput, resulting in wasted compute and memory bandwidth. To mitigate the issues, we present Bullet, a novel spatial-temporal orchestration system that eliminates these inefficiencies through precise phase coordination. Bullet enables concurrent execution of prefill and decode phases, while dynamically provisioning GPU resources using real-time performance modeling. By integrating SLO-aware scheduling and adaptive resource allocation, Bullet maximizes utilization without compromising latency targets. Experimental evaluations on real-world workloads demonstrate that Bullet delivers 1.26x average throughput gains (up to 1.55x) over state-of-the-arts, while consistently meeting latency constraints.</p></details> |  |

Measuring text generation tasks such as summarization and article creation is very difficult. Especially in specific application domains (e.g., to-business or to-customer service), in-house evaluation criteria have to meet not only general standards (correctness, helpfulness and creativity, etc.) but also specific needs of customers and business security requirements at the same time, making the evaluation more difficult. So far, the evaluation of LLM in business scenarios has mainly relied on manual, which is expensive and time-consuming. In this paper, we propose a model-based evaluation method: TALEC, which allows users to flexibly set their own evaluation criteria, and uses in-context learning (ICL) to teach judge model these in-house criteria. In addition, we try combining zero-shot and few-shot to make the judge model focus on more information. We also propose a prompt paradigm and an engineering approach to adjust and iterate the shots ,helping judge model to better understand the complex criteria. We then compare fine-tuning with ICL, finding that fine-tuning can be replaced by ICL. TALEC demonstrates a strong capability to accurately reflect human preferences and achieves a correlation of over 80% with human judgments, outperforming even the inter-human correlation in some tasks. The code is released in https://github.com/zlkqz/auto_eval</p></details> |  |

A Case Study with In-Context Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17552v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The remarkable performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) can be enhanced with test-time computation, which relies on external tools and even other deep learning models. However, existing approaches for integrating non-text modality representations into LLMs typically require additional costly supervised training, restricting on-the-fly adaptation to new domains and modalities. In this work, we explore the feasibility of integrating representations from non-text foundational models (FMs) into text-based LLMs in a training-free manner. We propose In-Context Representation Learning (ICRL) as a proof-of-concept to allow LLMs to adaptively utilize non-text modality representations with few-shot learning. Unlike traditional in-context learning, which incorporates text-label pairs, ICRL replaces text inputs with FM representations, enabling the LLM to perform multi-modal inference without fine-tuning. We evaluate ICRL on a suite of tasks in the molecular domain, investigating three core research questions: (i) how to map FM representations into LLMs in a training-free manner, (ii) what factors influence ICRL performance, and (iii) what mechanisms underlie the effectiveness of ICRL. To the best of our knowledge, ICRL is the first training-free framework for integrating non-text modality representations into text-based LLMs, presenting a promising direction for adaptable, multi-modal generalization.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |
| **[From Query to Logic: Ontology-Driven Multi-Hop Reasoning in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01424v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs), despite their success in question answering, exhibit limitations in complex multi-hop question answering (MQA) tasks that necessitate non-linear, structured reasoning. This limitation stems from their inability to adequately capture deep conceptual relationships between entities. To overcome this challenge, we present **ORACLE** (**O**ntology-driven **R**easoning **A**nd **C**hain for **L**ogical **E**ucidation), a training-free framework that combines LLMs' generative capabilities with the structural benefits of knowledge graphs. Our approach operates through three stages: (1) dynamic construction of question-specific knowledge ontologies using LLMs, (2) transformation of these ontologies into First-Order Logic reasoning chains, and (3) systematic decomposition of the original query into logically coherent sub-questions. Experimental results on several standard MQA benchmarks show that our framework achieves highly competitive performance, rivaling current state-of-the-art models like DeepSeek-R1. Detailed analyses further confirm the effectiveness of each component, while demonstrating that our method generates more logical and interpretable reasoning chains than existing approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[PART: Progressive Alignment Representation Training for Multilingual Speech-To-Text with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19745v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have expanded from text to speech, giving rise to Speech Large Models (SLMs) that support recognition, translation, and synthesis. A key challenge is aligning speech and text representations, which becomes harder in multilingual settings. Existing methods often freeze LLM parameters and train encoders on multilingual data, but this forces cross-language convergence and limits performance. We introduce Progressive Alignment Representation Training (PART), a multi-stage and multi-task framework that separates within-language from cross-language alignment. During cross-language training, LLM parameters are dynamically activated, and text-based tasks are later introduced to enhance multilingual understanding. Experiments on CommonVoice 15, Fleurs, Wenetspeech, and CoVoST2 show that PART surpasses conventional approaches, with analysis confirming its ability to balance language-specific distinctions and cross-language generalization. These results demonstrate PART's effectiveness and generality for multilingual speech modality alignment.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLMs for Cold-Start Cutting Plane Separator Configuration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12038v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mixed integer linear programming (MILP) solvers expose hundreds of parameters that have an outsized impact on performance but are difficult to configure for all but expert users. Existing machine learning (ML) approaches require training on thousands of related instances, generalize poorly and can be difficult to integrate into existing solver workflows. We propose a large language model (LLM)-based framework that configures cutting plane separators using problem descriptions and solver-specific separator summaries. To reduce variance in LLM outputs, we introduce an ensembling strategy that clusters and aggregates candidate configurations into a small portfolio of high-performing configurations. Our method requires no custom solver interface, generates configurations in seconds via simple API calls, and requires solving only a small number of instances. Extensive experiments on standard synthetic and real-world MILPs show our approach matches or outperforms state-of-the-art configuration methods with a fraction of the data and computation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Gyges: Dynamic Cross-Instance Parallelism Transformation for Efficient LLM Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19729v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficiently processing the dynamics of requests, especially the context length variance, is important in Large Language Model (LLM) serving scenarios. However, there is an intrinsic trade-off: while leveraging parallelism strategies, such as Tensor Parallelism (TP), can coordinate multiple GPUs to accommodate larger context lengths, it inevitably results in degraded overall throughput. In this paper, we propose Cross-Instance Parallelism Transformation (Gyges), which adaptively adjusts the parallelism strategies of running instances to align with the dynamics of incoming requests. We design (1) a page-friendly, header-centric layout to accelerate KV cache transformations; (2) dedicated weight padding to accelerate model weight transformations; and (3) a transformation-aware scheduler to cooperatively schedule requests and parallelism transformations, optimizing the overall performance. Evaluations using real-world traces show that Gyges improves throughput by 1.75x-6.57x compared to state-of-the-art solutions.</p></details> | 12 pages, 15 figures |
| **[Plan Verification for LLM-Based Embodied Task Completion Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02761v3)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM) based task plans and corresponding human demonstrations for embodied AI may be noisy, with unnecessary actions, redundant navigation, and logical errors that reduce policy quality. We propose an iterative verification framework in which a Judge LLM critiques action sequences and a Planner LLM applies the revisions, yielding progressively cleaner and more spatially coherent trajectories. Unlike rule-based approaches, our method relies on natural language prompting, enabling broad generalization across error types including irrelevant actions, contradictions, and missing steps. On a set of manually annotated actions from the TEACh embodied AI dataset, our framework achieves up to 90% recall and 100% precision across four state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT o4-mini, DeepSeek-R1, Gemini 2.5, LLaMA 4 Scout). The refinement loop converges quickly, with 96.5% of sequences requiring at most three iterations, while improving both temporal efficiency and spatial action organization. Crucially, the method preserves human error-recovery patterns rather than collapsing them, supporting future work on robust corrective behavior. By establishing plan verification as a reliable LLM capability for spatial planning and action refinement, we provide a scalable path to higher-quality training data for imitation learning in embodied AI.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automated Repair of Ambiguous Problem Descriptions for LLM-Based Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07270v3)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing use of large language models (LLMs) has increased the importance of natural language (NL) in software engineering. However, ambiguity of NL can harm software quality, as unclear problem descriptions may lead to incorrect program generation. Detecting and resolving such ambiguity is challenging, motivating our introduction of the automated repair of ambiguous NL descriptions, which we approach by reducing code generation uncertainty and better aligning NL with input-output examples. Ambiguity repair is difficult for LLMs because they must understand how their interpretation of a description changes when the text is altered. We find that directly prompting LLMs to clarify ambiguity often produces irrelevant or inconsistent edits. To address this, we decompose this task into two simpler steps: (1) analyzing and repairing the LLM's interpretation of the description - captured by the distribution of programs it induces - using traditional testing and program repair, and (2) refining the description based on distribution changes via a method we call contrastive specification inference. We implement this approach in a tool called SpecFix and evaluate it using four state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, DeepSeek-V3, and Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct) on three popular code generation benchmarks (HumanEval+, MBPP+ and LiveCodeBench). Without human intervention or external information, SpecFix modified 43.58% of descriptions, improving Pass@1 on the modified set by 30.9%. This yields a 4.09% absolute improvement across the entire benchmark. Repairs also transfer across models: descriptions repaired for one model improve other models' performance by 10.48%.</p></details> |  |
| **[PolicyPad: Collaborative Prototyping of LLM Policies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19680v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As LLMs gain adoption in high-stakes domains like mental health, domain experts are increasingly consulted to provide input into policies governing their behavior. From an observation of 19 policymaking workshops with 9 experts over 15 weeks, we identified opportunities to better support rapid experimentation, feedback, and iteration for collaborative policy design processes. We present PolicyPad, an interactive system that facilitates the emerging practice of LLM policy prototyping by drawing from established UX prototyping practices, including heuristic evaluation and storyboarding. Using PolicyPad, policy designers can collaborate on drafting a policy in real time while independently testing policy-informed model behavior with usage scenarios. We evaluate PolicyPad through workshops with 8 groups of 22 domain experts in mental health and law, finding that PolicyPad enhanced collaborative dynamics during policy design, enabled tight feedback loops, and led to novel policy contributions. Overall, our work paves participatory paths for advancing AI alignment and safety.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Unaligned to Aligned: Scaling Multilingual LLMs with Multi-Way Parallel Corpora](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14045v3)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continued pretraining and instruction tuning on large-scale multilingual data have proven to be effective in scaling large language models (LLMs) to low-resource languages. However, the unaligned nature of such data limits its ability to effectively capture cross-lingual semantics. In contrast, multi-way parallel data, where identical content is aligned across multiple languages, provides stronger cross-lingual consistency and offers greater potential for improving multilingual performance. In this paper, we introduce a large-scale, high-quality multi-way parallel corpus, TED2025, based on TED Talks. The corpus spans 113 languages, with up to 50 languages aligned in parallel, ensuring extensive multilingual coverage. Using this dataset, we investigate best practices for leveraging multi-way parallel data to enhance LLMs, including strategies for continued pretraining, instruction tuning, and the analysis of key influencing factors. Experiments on six multilingual benchmarks show that models trained on multiway parallel data consistently outperform those trained on unaligned multilingual data.</p></details> |  |

Despite recent advancements, Large Language Models (LLMs) have not been systematically evaluated for their ability to generate informative assertion messages. In this paper, we introduce an evaluation of four state-of-the-art Fill-in-the-Middle (FIM) LLMs - Qwen2.5-Coder-32B, Codestral-22B, CodeLlama-13B, and StarCoder - on a dataset of 216 Java test methods containing developer-written assertion messages. We find that Codestral-22B achieves the highest quality score of 2.76 out of 5 using a human-like evaluation approach, compared to 3.24 for manually written messages. Our ablation study shows that including descriptive test comments further improves Codestral's performance to 2.97, highlighting the critical role of context in generating clear assertion messages. Structural analysis demonstrates that all models frequently replicate developers' preferred linguistic patterns. We discuss the limitations of the selected models and conventional text evaluation metrics in capturing diverse assertion message structures. Our benchmark, evaluation results, and discussions provide an essential foundation for advancing automated, context-aware generation of assertion messages in test code.

To investigate these risks, we introduce a news-image benchmark consisting of 1,343 image-question pairs drawn from diverse outlets, which we annotated with ground-truth answers and demographic attributes (age, gender, race, occupation, and sports). We evaluate a range of state-of-the-art VLMs and employ a large language model (LLM) as judge, with human verification. Our findings show that: (i) visual context systematically shifts model outputs in open-ended settings; (ii) bias prevalence varies across attributes and models, with particularly high risk for gender and occupation; and (iii) higher faithfulness does not necessarily correspond to lower bias. We release the benchmark prompts, evaluation rubric, and code to support reproducible and fairness-aware multimodal assessment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025 Workshop (Evaluating the Evolving LLM Lifecycle)</p></details> |
| **[Advancing Speech Summarization in Multi-modal LLMs with Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19631v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Speech summarization is a critical component of spoken content understanding, particularly in the era of rapidly growing spoken and audiovisual data. Recent advances in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs), leveraging the power of LLMs, enable generating textual summaries directly from speech without intermediate transcriptions, while supporting controllable styles and zero-shot generalization. However, open-source MLLMs continue to lag behind the state-of-the-art text-based LLMs, limiting their practical deployment for speech summarization. In this work, we present a novel multi-stage reinforcement learning training framework to enhance the speech summarization capabilities in MLLMs. Our model delivers substantial improvements over strong baselines, outperforms much larger MLLMs, and significantly narrows the gap with state-of-the-art text-based LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[iFinder: Structured Zero-Shot Vision-Based LLM Grounding for Dash-Cam Video Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19552v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Grounding large language models (LLMs) in domain-specific tasks like post-hoc dash-cam driving video analysis is challenging due to their general-purpose training and lack of structured inductive biases. As vision is often the sole modality available for such analysis (i.e., no LiDAR, GPS, etc.), existing video-based vision-language models (V-VLMs) struggle with spatial reasoning, causal inference, and explainability of events in the input video. To this end, we introduce iFinder, a structured semantic grounding framework that decouples perception from reasoning by translating dash-cam videos into a hierarchical, interpretable data structure for LLMs. iFinder operates as a modular, training-free pipeline that employs pretrained vision models to extract critical cues -- object pose, lane positions, and object trajectories -- which are hierarchically organized into frame- and video-level structures. Combined with a three-block prompting strategy, it enables step-wise, grounded reasoning for the LLM to refine a peer V-VLM's outputs and provide accurate reasoning. Evaluations on four public dash-cam video benchmarks show that iFinder's proposed grounding with domain-specific cues, especially object orientation and global context, significantly outperforms end-to-end V-VLMs on four zero-shot driving benchmarks, with up to 39% gains in accident reasoning accuracy. By grounding LLMs with driving domain-specific representations, iFinder offers a zero-shot, interpretable, and reliable alternative to end-to-end V-VLMs for post-hoc driving video understanding.</p></details> |  |

While pruning reduces these demands, most methods ignore activation sparsity observed at runtime. We reinterpret activation sparsity as dynamic structured weight sparsity and propose DuoGPT, a unified framework that constructs dual-sparse (spMspV) workloads by combining unstructured weight pruning with activation sparsity. To preserve accuracy, we extend the Optimal Brain Compression (OBC) framework with activation-aware calibration and introduce output residuals from the dense model as correction terms. We further optimize the solution for efficient GPU execution, enabling scalability to billion-parameter LLMs. Evaluations on LLaMA-2 and LLaMA-3 show that DuoGPT outperforms state-of-the-art structured pruning methods by up to 9.17% accuracy at an iso-speedup of 1.39$\times$ compared to the baseline dense model.

| **[Semantic-Aware Fuzzing: An Empirical Framework for LLM-Guided, Reasoning-Driven Input Mutation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19533v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Security vulnerabilities in Internet-of-Things devices, mobile platforms, and autonomous systems remain critical. Traditional mutation-based fuzzers -- while effectively explore code paths -- primarily perform byte- or bit-level edits without semantic reasoning. Coverage-guided tools such as AFL++ use dictionaries, grammars, and splicing heuristics to impose shallow structural constraints, leaving deeper protocol logic, inter-field dependencies, and domain-specific semantics unaddressed. Conversely, reasoning-capable large language models (LLMs) can leverage pretraining knowledge to understand input formats, respect complex constraints, and propose targeted mutations, much like an experienced reverse engineer or testing expert. However, lacking ground truth for "correct" mutation reasoning makes supervised fine-tuning impractical, motivating explorations of off-the-shelf LLMs via prompt-based few-shot learning. To bridge this gap, we present an open-source microservices framework that integrates reasoning LLMs with AFL++ on Google's FuzzBench, tackling asynchronous execution and divergent hardware demands (GPU- vs. CPU-intensive) of LLMs and fuzzers. We evaluate four research questions: (R1) How can reasoning LLMs be integrated into the fuzzing mutation loop? (R2) Do few-shot prompts yield higher-quality mutations than zero-shot? (R3) Can prompt engineering with off-the-shelf models improve fuzzing directly? and (R4) Which open-source reasoning LLMs perform best under prompt-only conditions? Experiments with Llama3.3, Deepseek-r1-Distill-Llama-70B, QwQ-32B, and Gemma3 highlight Deepseek as the most promising. Mutation effectiveness depends more on prompt complexity and model choice than shot count. Response latency and throughput bottlenecks remain key obstacles, offering directions for future work.</p></details> |  |
| **[Clotho: Measuring Task-Specific Pre-Generation Test Adequacy for LLM Inputs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17314v2)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software increasingly relies on the emergent capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), from natural language understanding to program analysis and generation. Yet testing them on specific tasks remains difficult and costly: many prompts lack ground truth, forcing reliance on human judgment, while existing uncertainty and adequacy measures typically require full inference. A key challenge is to assess input adequacy in a way that reflects the demands of the task, ideally before even generating any output. We introduce CLOTHO, a task-specific, pre-generation adequacy measure that estimates input difficulty directly from hidden LLM states. Given a large pool of unlabelled inputs for a specific task, CLOTHO uses a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to adaptively sample the most informative cases for human labelling. Based on this reference set the GMM can then rank unseen inputs by their likelihood of failure. In our empirical evaluation across eight benchmark tasks and three open-weight LLMs, CLOTHO can predict failures with a ROC-AUC of 0.716, after labelling reference sets that are on average only 5.4% of inputs. It does so without generating any outputs, thereby reducing costs compared to existing uncertainty measures. Comparison of CLOTHO and post-generation uncertainty measures shows that the two approaches complement each other. Crucially, we show that adequacy scores learnt from open-weight LLMs transfer effectively to proprietary models, extending the applicability of the approach. When prioritising test inputs for proprietary models, CLOTHO increases the average number of failing inputs from 18.7 to 42.5 out of 100, compared to random prioritisation.</p></details> |  |

This short note analyzes an estimator of the self-consistency of LLMs and the tradeoffs it induces under a fixed compute budget $B=mn$, where $m$ is the number of prompts sampled from the task distribution and $n$ is the number of repeated LLM calls per prompt; the resulting analysis favors a rough split $m,n\propto\sqrt{B}$.</p></details> | 5 pages |
| **[Premise-Augmented Reasoning Chains Improve Error Identification in Math reasoning with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02362v6)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting enhances mathematical reasoning in large language models (LLMs) by enabling detailed step-by-step solutions. However, due to the verbosity of LLMs, the resulting reasoning chains can be long, making it harder to verify the reasoning steps and trace issues resulting from dependencies between the steps that may be farther away in the sequence of steps. Importantly, mathematical reasoning allows each step to be derived from a small set of premises, which are a subset of the preceding steps in the reasoning chain. In this paper, we present a framework that identifies the premises for each step, to improve the evaluation of reasoning. We restructure conventional linear reasoning chains into Premise Augmented Reasoning Chains (PARC) by introducing premise links, resulting in a directed acyclic graph where the nodes are the steps and the edges are the premise links. Through experiments with a PARC-based dataset that we built, namely PERL (Premises and ERrors identification in LLMs), we demonstrate that LLMs can reliably identify premises within complex reasoning chains. In particular, even open-source LLMs achieve 90% recall in premise identification. We also show that PARC helps to identify errors in reasoning chains more reliably. The accuracy of error identification improves by 6% to 16% absolute when step-by-step verification is carried out in PARC under the premises. Our findings highlight the utility of premise-centric representations in addressing complex problem-solving tasks and open new avenues for improving the reliability of LLM-based reasoning evaluations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICML 2025</p></details> |

While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at understanding context, they face limitations with long input sequences. Existing approaches that combine SQL and LLMs typically rely on rigid, predefined work-flows, limiting their adaptability to complex queries. To address these issues, we introduce Weaver , a modular pipeline that dynamically integrates SQL and LLMs for table-based question answering (TableQA). Weaver generates a flexible, step-by-step plan that combines SQL for structured data retrieval with LLMs for semantic processing. By decomposing complex queries into manageable subtasks, Weaver improves accuracy and generalization. Our experiments show that Weaver consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across four TableQA datasets, reducing both API calls and error rates. The code, along with other associated scripts, are available at https://coral-lab-asu.github.io/weaver.</p></details> |  |
| **[Strategic Dishonesty Can Undermine AI Safety Evaluations of Frontier LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18058v2)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM) developers aim for their models to be honest, helpful, and harmless. However, when faced with malicious requests, models are trained to refuse, sacrificing helpfulness. We show that frontier LLMs can develop a preference for dishonesty as a new strategy, even when other options are available. Affected models respond to harmful requests with outputs that sound harmful but are crafted to be subtly incorrect or otherwise harmless in practice. This behavior emerges with hard-to-predict variations even within models from the same model family. We find no apparent cause for the propensity to deceive, but show that more capable models are better at executing this strategy. Strategic dishonesty already has a practical impact on safety evaluations, as we show that dishonest responses fool all output-based monitors used to detect jailbreaks that we test, rendering benchmark scores unreliable. Further, strategic dishonesty can act like a honeypot against malicious users, which noticeably obfuscates prior jailbreak attacks. While output monitors fail, we show that linear probes on internal activations can be used to reliably detect strategic dishonesty. We validate probes on datasets with verifiable outcomes and by using them as steering vectors. Overall, we consider strategic dishonesty as a concrete example of a broader concern that alignment of LLMs is hard to control, especially when helpfulness and harmlessness conflict.</p></details> |  |
| **[Extracting Conceptual Spaces from LLMs Using Prototype Embeddings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19269v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conceptual spaces represent entities and concepts using cognitively meaningful dimensions, typically referring to perceptual features. Such representations are widely used in cognitive science and have the potential to serve as a cornerstone for explainable AI. Unfortunately, they have proven notoriously difficult to learn, although recent LLMs appear to capture the required perceptual features to a remarkable extent. Nonetheless, practical methods for extracting the corresponding conceptual spaces are currently still lacking. While various methods exist for extracting embeddings from LLMs, extracting conceptual spaces also requires us to encode the underlying features. In this paper, we propose a strategy in which features (e.g. sweetness) are encoded by embedding the description of a corresponding prototype (e.g. a very sweet food). To improve this strategy, we fine-tune the LLM to align the prototype embeddings with the corresponding conceptual space dimensions. Our empirical analysis finds this approach to be highly effective.</p></details> |  |

Traditional SAST tools, while effective for proactive security, are limited by high false-positive rates and a lack of contextual understanding. Conversely, LLMs excel at code analysis and pattern recognition but can be prone to inconsistencies and hallucinations. By integrating these two technologies, a more intelligent and efficient system is created. This combination moves beyond mere vulnerability detection optimization, transforming security into a deeply integrated, contextual process that provides tangible benefits like improved triage, dynamic bug descriptions, bug validation via exploit generation and enhanced analysis of complex codebases. The result is a more effective security approach that leverages the strengths of both technologies while mitigating their weaknesses. SAST-Genius reduced false positives by about 91 % (225 to 20) compared to Semgrep alone.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cross-Cultural Transfer of Commonsense Reasoning in LLMs: Evidence from the Arab World](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19265v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) often reflect Western-centric biases, limiting their effectiveness in diverse cultural contexts. Although some work has explored cultural alignment, the potential for cross-cultural transfer, using alignment in one culture to improve performance in others, remains underexplored. This paper investigates cross-cultural transfer of commonsense reasoning in the Arab world, where linguistic and historical similarities coexist with local cultural differences. Using a culturally grounded commonsense reasoning dataset covering 13 Arab countries, we evaluate lightweight alignment methods such as in-context learning and demonstration-based reinforcement (DITTO), alongside baselines like supervised fine-tuning and direct preference optimization. Our results show that merely 12 culture-specific examples from one country can improve performance in others by 10\% on average, within multilingual models. In addition, we demonstrate that out-of-culture demonstrations from Indonesia and US contexts can match or surpass in-culture alignment for MCQ reasoning, highlighting cultural commonsense transferability beyond the Arab world. These findings demonstrate that efficient cross-cultural alignment is possible and offer a promising approach to adapt LLMs to low-resource cultural settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2025 - Findings</p></details> |

Specifically, we aim to capture frequent co-occurring changes ("trends") across a city over a certain period. Unlike previous visual analyses, our analysis answers open-ended queries (e.g., "what are the frequent types of changes in the city?") without any predetermined target subjects or training labels. These properties cast prior learning-based or unsupervised visual analysis tools unsuitable. We identify MLLMs as a novel tool for their open-ended semantic understanding capabilities. Yet, our datasets are four orders of magnitude too large for an MLLM to ingest as context. So we introduce a bottom-up procedure that decomposes the massive visual analysis problem into more tractable sub-problems. We carefully design MLLM-based solutions to each sub-problem. During experiments and ablation studies with our system, we find it significantly outperforms baselines and is able to discover interesting trends from images captured in large cities (e.g., "addition of outdoor dining,", "overpass was painted blue," etc.).

| **[Improving Image Captioning Descriptiveness by Ranking and LLM-based Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11593v2)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State-of-The-Art (SoTA) image captioning models are often trained on the MicroSoft Common Objects in Context (MS-COCO) dataset, which contains human-annotated captions with an average length of approximately ten tokens. Although effective for general scene understanding, these short captions often fail to capture complex scenes and convey detailed information. Moreover, captioning models tend to exhibit bias towards the ``average'' caption, which captures only the more general aspects, thus overlooking finer details. In this paper, we present a novel approach to generate richer and more informative image captions by combining the captions generated from different SoTA captioning models. Our proposed method requires no additional model training: given an image, it leverages pre-trained models from the literature to generate the initial captions, and then ranks them using a newly introduced image-text-based metric, which we name BLIPScore. Subsequently, the top two captions are fused using a Large Language Model (LLM) to produce the final, more detailed description. Experimental results on the MS-COCO and Flickr30k test sets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in terms of caption-image alignment and hallucination reduction according to the ALOHa, CAPTURE, and Polos metrics. A subjective study lends additional support to these results, suggesting that the captions produced by our model are generally perceived as more consistent with human judgment. By combining the strengths of diverse SoTA models, our method enhances the quality and appeal of image captions, bridging the gap between automated systems and the rich and informative nature of human-generated descriptions. This advance enables the generation of more suitable captions for the training of both vision-language and captioning models.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript has been accepted for publication in Springer Neural Computing and Applications</p></details> |
| **[LLMs as verification oracles for Solidity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19153v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring the correctness of smart contracts is critical, as even subtle flaws can lead to severe financial losses. While bug detection tools able to spot common vulnerability patterns can serve as a first line of defense, most real-world exploits and losses stem from errors in the contract business logic. Formal verification tools such as SolCMC and the Certora Prover address this challenge, but their impact remains limited by steep learning curves and restricted specification languages. Recent works have begun to explore the use of large language models (LLMs) for security-related tasks such as vulnerability detection and test generation. Yet, a fundamental question remains open: can LLMs serve as verification oracles, capable of reasoning about arbitrary contract-specific properties? In this paper, we provide the first systematic evaluation of GPT-5, a state-of-the-art reasoning LLM, in this role. We benchmark its performance on a large dataset of verification tasks, compare its outputs against those of established formal verification tools, and assess its practical effectiveness in real-world auditing scenarios. Our study combines quantitative metrics with qualitative analysis, and shows that recent reasoning-oriented LLMs can be surprisingly effective as verification oracles, suggesting a new frontier in the convergence of AI and formal methods for secure smart contract development and auditing.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Soundness and Consistency of LLM Agents for Executing Test Cases Written in Natural Language](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19136v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The use of natural language (NL) test cases for validating graphical user interface (GUI) applications is emerging as a promising direction to manually written executable test scripts, which are costly to develop and difficult to maintain. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have opened the possibility of the direct execution of NL test cases by LLM agents. This paper investigates this direction, focusing on the impact on NL test case unsoundness and on test case execution consistency. NL test cases are inherently unsound, as they may yield false failures due to ambiguous instructions or unpredictable agent behaviour. Furthermore, repeated executions of the same NL test case may lead to inconsistent outcomes, undermining test reliability. To address these challenges, we propose an algorithm for executing NL test cases with guardrail mechanisms and specialised agents that dynamically verify the correct execution of each test step. We introduce measures to evaluate the capabilities of LLMs in test execution and one measure to quantify execution consistency. We propose a definition of weak unsoundness to characterise contexts in which NL test case execution remains acceptable, with respect to the industrial quality levels Six Sigma. Our experimental evaluation with eight publicly available LLMs, ranging from 3B to 70B parameters, demonstrates both the potential and current limitations of current LLM agents for GUI testing. Our experiments show that Meta Llama 3.1 70B demonstrates acceptable capabilities in NL test case execution with high execution consistency (above the level 3-sigma). We provide prototype tools, test suites, and results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Global XAI Methods Reveal Injected Bias in LLMs? SHAP vs Rule Extraction vs RuleSHAP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11189v2)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) can amplify misinformation, undermining societal goals like the UN SDGs. We study three documented drivers of misinformation (valence framing, information overload, and oversimplification) which are often shaped by one's default beliefs. Building on evidence that LLMs encode such defaults (e.g., "joy is positive," "math is complex") and can act as "bags of heuristics," we ask: can general belief-driven heuristics behind misinformative behaviour be recovered from LLMs as clear rules? A key obstacle is that global rule-extraction methods in explainable AI (XAI) are built for numerical inputs/outputs, not text. We address this by eliciting global LLM beliefs and mapping them to numerical scores via statistically reliable abstractions, thereby enabling off-the-shelf global XAI to detect belief-related heuristics in LLMs. To obtain ground truth, we hard-code bias-inducing nonlinear heuristics of increasing complexity (univariate, conjunctive, nonconvex) into popular LLMs (ChatGPT and Llama) via system instructions. This way, we find that RuleFit under-detects non-univariate biases, while global SHAP better approximates conjunctive ones but does not yield actionable rules. To bridge this gap, we propose RuleSHAP, a rule-extraction algorithm that couples global SHAP-value aggregations with rule induction to better capture non-univariate bias, improving heuristics detection over RuleFit by +94% (MRR@1) on average. Our results provide a practical pathway for revealing belief-driven biases in LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Probing LLM World Models: Enhancing Guesstimation with Wisdom of Crowds Decoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17310v4)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Guesstimation--the task of making approximate quantitative estimates about objects or events-is a common real--world skill, yet remains underexplored in large language model (LLM) research. We introduce three guesstimation datasets: MARBLES, FUTURE, and ELECPRED, spanning physical estimation (e.g., how many marbles fit in a cup) to abstract predictions (e.g., the 2024 U.S. presidential election). Inspired by the social science concept of Wisdom of Crowds (WOC)- where the median of multiple estimates improves accuracy-we propose WOC decoding for LLMs. We replicate WOC effects in human participants and find that LLMs exhibit similar benefits: median aggregation across sampled responses consistently improves accuracy over greedy decoding, self-consistency decoding, and mean decoding. This suggests that LLMs encode a world model that supports approximate reasoning. Our results position guesstimation as a useful probe of LLM world knowledge and highlight WOC decoding as a strategy for enhancing LLM guesstimation performance on real-world tasks.</p></details> |  |

Existing taxonomy construction methods, leveraging unsupervised clustering or direct prompting of large language models (LLMs), often lack coherence and granularity. We propose a novel context-aware hierarchical taxonomy generation framework that integrates LLM-guided multi-aspect encoding with dynamic clustering. Our method leverages LLMs to identify key aspects of each paper (e.g., methodology, dataset, evaluation) and generates aspect-specific paper summaries, which are then encoded and clustered along each aspect to form a coherent hierarchy. In addition, we introduce a new evaluation benchmark of 156 expert-crafted taxonomies encompassing 11.6k papers, providing the first naturally annotated dataset for this task. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms prior approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance in taxonomy coherence, granularity, and interpretability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2025 Main</p></details> |
| **[LLM-based Vulnerability Discovery through the Lens of Code Metrics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19117v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) excel in many tasks of software engineering, yet progress in leveraging them for vulnerability discovery has stalled in recent years. To understand this phenomenon, we investigate LLMs through the lens of classic code metrics. Surprisingly, we find that a classifier trained solely on these metrics performs on par with state-of-the-art LLMs for vulnerability discovery. A root-cause analysis reveals a strong correlation and a causal effect between LLMs and code metrics: When the value of a metric is changed, LLM predictions tend to shift by a corresponding magnitude. This dependency suggests that LLMs operate at a similarly shallow level as code metrics, limiting their ability to grasp complex patterns and fully realize their potential in vulnerability discovery. Based on these findings, we derive recommendations on how research should more effectively address this challenge.</p></details> |  |
| **[DRO-REBEL: Distributionally Robust Relative-Reward Regression for Fast and Efficient LLM Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19104v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) has become crucial for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human intent. However, existing offline RLHF approaches suffer from overoptimization, where models overfit to reward misspecification and drift from preferred behaviors observed during training. We introduce DRO-REBEL, a unified family of robust REBEL updates with type-$p$ Wasserstein, KL, and $\chi^2$ ambiguity sets. Using Fenchel duality, each update reduces to a simple relative-reward regression, preserving scalability and avoiding PPO-style clipping or auxiliary value networks. Under standard linear-reward and log-linear policy classes with a data-coverage condition, we establish $O(n^{-1/4})$ estimation bounds with tighter constants than prior DRO-DPO approaches, and recover the minimax-optimal $O(n^{-1/2})$ rate via a localized Rademacher complexity analysis. The same analysis closes the gap for Wasserstein-DPO and KL-DPO, showing both also attain optimal parametric rates. We derive practical SGD algorithms for all three divergences: gradient regularization (Wasserstein), importance weighting (KL), and a fast 1-D dual solve ($\chi^2$). Experiments on Emotion Alignment, the large-scale ArmoRM multi-objective benchmark, and HH-Alignment demonstrate strong worst-case robustness across unseen preference mixtures, model sizes, and data scales, with $\chi^2$-REBEL showing consistently strong empirical performance. A controlled radius--coverage study validates a no-free-lunch trade-off: radii shrinking faster than empirical divergence concentration rates achieve minimax-optimal parametric rates but forfeit coverage, while coverage-guaranteeing radii incur $O(n^{-1/4})$ rates.</p></details> | <details><summary>70 pa...</summary><p>70 pages, 9 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

Large language models (LLMs) excel at extracting biomedical relations, yet their outputs lack standardization and alignment with ontologies, limiting KG integration. We introduce RELATE, a three-stage pipeline that maps LLM-extracted relations to standardized ontology predicates using ChemProt and the Biolink Model. The pipeline includes: (1) ontology preprocessing with predicate embeddings, (2) similarity-based retrieval enhanced with SapBERT, and (3) LLM-based reranking with explicit negation handling. This approach transforms relation extraction from free-text outputs to structured, ontology-constrained representations. On the ChemProt benchmark, RELATE achieves 52% exact match and 94% accuracy@10, and in 2,400 HEAL Project abstracts, it effectively rejects irrelevant associations (0.4%) and identifies negated assertions. RELATE captures nuanced biomedical relationships while ensuring quality for KG augmentation. By combining vector search with contextual LLM reasoning, RELATE provides a scalable, semantically accurate framework for converting unstructured biomedical literature into standardized KGs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unraveling Misinformation Propagation in LLM Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18555v2)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in reasoning, positioning them as promising tools for supporting human problem-solving. However, what happens when their performance is affected by misinformation, i.e., incorrect inputs introduced by users due to oversights or gaps in knowledge? Such misinformation is prevalent in real-world interactions with LLMs, yet how it propagates within LLMs' reasoning process remains underexplored. Focusing on mathematical reasoning, we present a comprehensive analysis of how misinformation affects intermediate reasoning steps and final answers. We also examine how effectively LLMs can correct misinformation when explicitly instructed to do so. Even with explicit instructions, LLMs succeed less than half the time in rectifying misinformation, despite possessing correct internal knowledge, leading to significant accuracy drops (10.02% - 72.20%), and the degradation holds with thinking models (4.30% - 19.97%). Further analysis shows that applying factual corrections early in the reasoning process most effectively reduces misinformation propagation, and fine-tuning on synthesized data with early-stage corrections significantly improves reasoning factuality. Our work offers a practical approach to mitigating misinformation propagation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2025 (Findings)</p></details> |

However, existing multi-agent frameworks often rely on static or task-level workflows, which either over-process simple queries or underperform on complex ones, while also neglecting the efficiency-performance trade-offs across heterogeneous LLMs. To address these limitations, we propose Difficulty-Aware Agentic Orchestration (DAAO), a dynamic framework that adapts workflow depth, operator selection, and LLM assignment based on the difficulty of each input query. DAAO comprises three interdependent modules: a variational autoencoder (VAE) for difficulty estimation, a modular operator allocator, and a cost- and performance-aware LLM router. By leveraging heterogeneous LLMs and dynamically tailoring workflows, DAAO enables fine-grained, query-specific reasoning strategies. DAAO outperforms prior multi-agent systems in both accuracy and inference efficiency across six benchmarks. We will release our code and implementation details upon publication.</p></details> |  |

Comprehensive and in-depth analyses of these data are critical for hypothesis validation, anomaly detection, reproducibility, and impactful findings. Although workflow provenance techniques support such analyses, at large scale, the provenance data become complex and difficult to analyze. Existing systems depend on custom scripts, structured queries, or static dashboards, limiting data interaction. In this work, we introduce an evaluation methodology, reference architecture, and open-source implementation that leverages interactive Large Language Model (LLM) agents for runtime data analysis. Our approach uses a lightweight, metadata-driven design that translates natural language into structured provenance queries. Evaluations across LLaMA, GPT, Gemini, and Claude, covering diverse query classes and a real-world chemistry workflow, show that modular design, prompt tuning, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enable accurate and insightful LLM agent responses beyond recorded provenance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted in the proceedings of the Supercomputing Conference (SC).

The model is based on constrained matrix factorization, where user types are explicitly represented and predicted item scores share the same scale as observed ratings, making the model's internal representations and predicted scores directly interpretable. This structure is translated into natural language explanations using carefully designed LLM prompts. Many works in explainable AI rely on automatic evaluation metrics, which often fail to capture users' actual needs and perceptions. In contrast, we adopt a user-centered approach: we conduct a study with 326 participants who assessed the quality of the explanations across five key dimensions-transparency, effectiveness, persuasion, trust, and satisfaction-as well as the recommendations themselves.To evaluate how different explanation strategies are perceived, we generate multiple explanation types from the same underlying model, varying the input information provided to the LLM. Our analysis reveals that all explanation types are generally well received, with moderate statistical differences between strategies. User comments further underscore how participants react to each type of explanation, offering complementary insights beyond the quantitative results.</p></details> |  |

These agents are increasingly being deployed across diverse real-world applications, including student education, scientific research, and financial analysis. However, despite their remarkable potential, LLM-based agents remain vulnerable to hallucination issues, which can result in erroneous task execution and undermine the reliability of the overall system design. Addressing this critical challenge requires a deep understanding and a systematic consolidation of recent advances on LLM-based agents. To this end, we present the first comprehensive survey of hallucinations in LLM-based agents. By carefully analyzing the complete workflow of agents, we propose a new taxonomy that identifies different types of agent hallucinations occurring at different stages. Furthermore, we conduct an in-depth examination of eighteen triggering causes underlying the emergence of agent hallucinations. Through a detailed review of a large number of existing studies, we summarize approaches for hallucination mitigation and detection, and highlight promising directions for future research. We hope this survey will inspire further efforts toward addressing hallucinations in LLM-based agents, ultimately contributing to the development of more robust and reliable agent systems.</p></details> |  |

While various tools attempt to evaluate PDF accessibility, there is no standardized methodology to evaluate how different accessibility assessment approaches perform. Our work addresses this critical gap by introducing a novel benchmark dataset of scholarly PDFs with expert-validated accessibility annotations across seven criteria (alternative text quality, logical reading order, semantic tagging, table structure, functional hyperlinks, color contrast, and font readability), and a four-category evaluation framework with standardized labels (Passed, Failed, Not Present, Cannot Tell) to systematically assess accessibility evaluation approaches. Using our evaluation framework, we explore whether large language models (LLMs) are capable of supporting automated accessibility evaluation. We benchmark five LLMs, which demonstrate varying capabilities in correctly assessing different accessibility criteria, with GPT-4-Turbo achieving the highest overall accuracy (0.85). However, all models struggled in correctly categorizing documents with Not Present and Cannot Tell accessibility labels, particularly for alt text quality assessment. Our qualitative comparison with standard automated checkers reveals complementary strengths: rule-based tools excel at technical verification, while LLMs better evaluate semantic appropriateness and contextual relevance. Based on our findings, we propose a hybrid approach that would combine automated checkers, LLM evaluation, and human assessment as a future strategy for PDF accessibility evaluation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Kernel Design for Bayesian Optimization Is a Piece of CAKE with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17998v2)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The efficiency of Bayesian optimization (BO) relies heavily on the choice of the Gaussian process (GP) kernel, which plays a central role in balancing exploration and exploitation under limited evaluation budgets. Traditional BO methods often rely on fixed or heuristic kernel selection strategies, which can result in slow convergence or suboptimal solutions when the chosen kernel is poorly suited to the underlying objective function. To address this limitation, we propose a freshly-baked Context-Aware Kernel Evolution (CAKE) to enhance BO with large language models (LLMs). Concretely, CAKE leverages LLMs as the crossover and mutation operators to adaptively generate and refine GP kernels based on the observed data throughout the optimization process. To maximize the power of CAKE, we further propose BIC-Acquisition Kernel Ranking (BAKER) to select the most effective kernel through balancing the model fit measured by the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) with the expected improvement at each iteration of BO. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our fresh CAKE-based BO method consistently outperforms established baselines across a range of real-world tasks, including hyperparameter optimization, controller tuning, and photonic chip design.

Detecting such malicious contracts at the time of deployment is an important proactive strategy preventing loss from victim contracts. It offers a better cost-benefit than detecting vulnerabilities on diverse potential victims. However, existing works are not generic with limited detection types and effectiveness due to imbalanced samples, while the emerging LLM technologies, which show its potentials in generalization, have two key problems impeding its application in this task: hard digestion of compiled-code inputs, especially those with task-specific logic, and hard assessment of LLMs' certainty in their binary answers, i.e., yes-or-no answers. Therefore, we propose a generic adversarial smart contracts detection framework FinDet, which leverages LLMs with two enhancements addressing above two problems. FinDet takes as input only the EVM-bytecode contracts and identifies adversarial ones among them with high balanced accuracy. The first enhancement extracts concise semantic intentions and high-level behavioral logic from the low-level bytecode inputs, unleashing the LLM reasoning capability restricted by the task input. The second enhancement probes and measures the LLM uncertainty to its multi-round answering to the same query, improving the LLM answering robustness for binary classifications required by the task output. Our comprehensive evaluation shows that FinDet achieves a BAC of 0.9223 and a TPR of 0.8950, significantly outperforming existing baselines. It remains robust under challenging conditions including unseen attack patterns, low-data settings, and feature obfuscation. FinDet detects all 5 public and 20+ unreported adversarial contracts in a 10-day real-world test, confirmed manually.</p></details> |  |

Many studies found preferences for left-leaning positions in LLMs, but downstream effects on tasks like fact-checking remain underexplored. In this study, we systematically investigate political bias through exchanging words with euphemisms or dysphemisms in German claims. We construct minimal pairs of factually equivalent claims that differ in political connotation, to assess the consistency of LLMs in classifying them as true or false. We evaluate six LLMs and find that, more than political leaning, the presence of judgmental words significantly influences truthfulness assessment. While a few models show tendencies of political bias, this is not mitigated by explicitly calling for objectivism in prompts.

However, as LLMs handle confidential inputs and are fine-tuned on costly, proprietary datasets, their heightened security requirements slow adoption in privacy-sensitive sectors such as healthcare and finance. We investigate methods to address this gap and propose Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) as a solution for securing end-to-end LLM inference. We validate their practicality by evaluating these compute-intensive workloads entirely within CPU and GPU TEEs. On the CPU side, we conduct an in-depth study running full Llama2 inference pipelines (7B, 13B, 70B) inside Intel's TDX and SGX, accelerated by Advanced Matrix Extensions (AMX). We derive 12 insights, including that across various data types, batch sizes, and input lengths, CPU TEEs impose under 10% throughput and 20% latency overheads, further reduced by AMX. We run LLM inference on NVIDIA H100 Confidential Compute GPUs, contextualizing our CPU findings and observing throughput penalties of 4-8% that diminish as batch and input sizes grow. By comparing performance, cost, and security trade-offs, we show how CPU TEEs can be more cost-effective or secure than their GPU counterparts. To our knowledge, our work is the first to comprehensively demonstrate the performance and practicality of modern TEEs across both CPUs and GPUs for enabling confidential LLMs (cLLMs).</p></details> |  |

Users may be steered toward harmful content while independent auditing of these processes remains blocked. Large Language Models (LLMs) raise a new concern: the potential to reverse-engineer sensitive user attributes from exposure alone. We introduce a multi-stage auditing framework to investigate these risks. First, a large-scale audit of over 435,000 ad impressions delivered to 891 Australian Facebook users reveals algorithmic biases, including disproportionate Gambling and Politics ads shown to socioeconomically vulnerable and politically aligned groups. Second, a multimodal LLM can reconstruct users' demographic profiles from ad streams, outperforming census-based baselines and matching or exceeding human performance. Our results provide the first empirical evidence that ad streams constitute rich digital footprints for public AI inference, highlighting urgent privacy risks and the need for content-level auditing and governance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prompting for Performance: Exploring LLMs for Configuring Software](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09790v2)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software systems usually provide numerous configuration options that can affect performance metrics such as execution time, memory usage, binary size, or bitrate. On the one hand, making informed decisions is challenging and requires domain expertise in options and their combinations. On the other hand, machine learning techniques can search vast configuration spaces, but with a high computational cost, since concrete executions of numerous configurations are required. In this exploratory study, we investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can assist in performance-oriented software configuration through prompts. We evaluate several LLMs on tasks including identifying relevant options, ranking configurations, and recommending performant configurations across various configurable systems, such as compilers, video encoders, and SAT solvers. Our preliminary results reveal both positive abilities and notable limitations: depending on the task and systems, LLMs can well align with expert knowledge, whereas hallucinations or superficial reasoning can emerge in other cases. These findings represent a first step toward systematic evaluations and the design of LLM-based solutions to assist with software configuration.</p></details> | ICTAI 2025 |

Although large language models (LLMs) show promise in automating ICD coding, their challenges in base model selection, input contextualization, and training data redundancy limit their effectiveness. We propose a modular framework for ICD-10 Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) code prediction that addresses these challenges through principled model selection, redundancy-aware data sampling, and structured input design. The framework integrates an LLM-as-judge evaluation protocol with Plackett-Luce aggregation to assess and rank open-source LLMs based on their intrinsic comprehension of ICD-10-CM code definitions. We introduced embedding-based similarity measures, a redundancy-aware sampling strategy to remove semantically duplicated discharge summaries. We leverage structured discharge summaries from Taiwanese hospitals to evaluate contextual effects and examine section-wise content inclusion under universal and section-specific modelling paradigms. Experiments across two institutional datasets demonstrate that the selected base model after fine-tuning consistently outperforms baseline LLMs in internal and external evaluations. Incorporating more clinical sections consistently improves prediction performance. This study uses open-source LLMs to establish a practical and principled approach to ICD-10-CM code prediction. The proposed framework provides a scalable, institution-ready solution for real-world deployment of automated medical coding systems by combining informed model selection, efficient data refinement, and context-aware prompting.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 Pa...</summary><p>28 Pages, 4 Figures, 2 Tables</p></details> |

One strategy that many universities pursue is to customize pre-trained LLM as-a-service (LLMaaS). While most studies on LLMaaS chatbots prioritize technical adaptations, we focus on psychological effects of user-salient customizations, such as interface changes. We assume that such customizations influence users' perception of the system and are therefore important in guiding safe and appropriate use. In a field study, we examine how students and employees (N = 526) at a German university perceive and use their institution's customized LLMaaS chatbot compared to ChatGPT. Participants using both systems (n = 116) reported greater trust, higher perceived privacy and less experienced hallucinations with their university's customized LLMaaS chatbot in contrast to ChatGPT. We discuss theoretical implications for research on calibrated trust, and offer guidance on the design and deployment of LLMaaS chatbots.</p></details> | <details><summary>Added...</summary><p>Added missing author to the author list; no other changes</p></details> |

We are particularly interested in the context of biomedical question-answering, a domain we explored by participating in Task 13B Phase B of the BioASQ challenge. In this work, we compare several open-weight models against top-performing systems such as GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Claude 3.7 Sonnet. To enhance question answering capabilities, we use various techniques including retrieving the most relevant snippets based on embedding distance, in-context learning, and structured outputs. For certain submissions, we utilize ensemble approaches to leverage the diverse outputs generated by different models for exact-answer questions. Our results demonstrate that open-weight LLMs are comparable to proprietary ones. In some instances, open-weight LLMs even surpassed their closed counterparts, particularly when ensembling strategies were applied.

Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been explored for HPT, yet most rely on models exceeding 100 billion parameters. We propose an Expert Block Framework for HPT using Small LLMs. At its core is the Trajectory Context Summarizer (TCS), a deterministic block that transforms raw training trajectories into structured context, enabling small LLMs to analyze optimization progress with reliability comparable to larger models. Using two locally-run LLMs (phi4:reasoning14B and qwen2.5-coder:32B) and a 10-trial budget, our TCS-enabled HPT pipeline achieves average performance within ~0.9 percentage points of GPT-4 across six diverse tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, existing benchmarks mainly formalize the task as a static, single-turn problem, overlooking the stepwise requirement changes and iterative workflows in real-world software development. This mismatch limits the understanding of how well LLMs can support real-world development workflows. Constructing such iterative benchmarks is challenging due to the lack of public interaction traces and the difficulty of creating discriminative, turn-specific test cases. To bridge this gap, we present SR-Eval, a benchmark specifically designed to assess LLMs on iterative code generation under Stepwise requirements Refinement. SR-Eval spans both function-level and repository-level tasks in Python and Java, enabling fine-grained and progressive evaluation across evolving requirements. The construction of SR-Eval follows a carefully designed pipeline that first leverages a multi-agent-based requirement generation method to simulate the development process and recover the multi-round interaction process from final requirements, then employs a semantic-aware discriminative test case generation component to ensure discriminative and consistent evaluation at each turn. SR-Eval comprises 443 multi-turn tasks and 1,857 questions at both function and repository levels. Using SR-Eval, we evaluate 11 representative LLMs with three prompting strategies that simulate different usage patterns. Results show that iterative code generation under stepwise requirement refinement remains highly challenging: the best-performing model achieves only 22.67% completion rate on function-level tasks and 20.00% on repository-level tasks. We further observe that prompting strategies substantially influence performance, highlighting the need for the development of advanced methods.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces ActiveFlow, the first LLM inference framework that can achieve adaptive DRAM usage for modern LLMs (not ReLU-based), enabling the scaling up of deployable model sizes. The framework is based on the novel concept of active weight DRAM-flash swapping and incorporates three novel techniques: (1) Cross-layer active weights preloading. It uses the activations from the current layer to predict the active weights of several subsequent layers, enabling computation and data loading to overlap, as well as facilitating large I/O transfers. (2) Sparsity-aware self-distillation. It adjusts the active weights to align with the dense-model output distribution, compensating for approximations introduced by contextual sparsity. (3) Active weight DRAM-flash swapping pipeline. It orchestrates the DRAM space allocation among the hot weight cache, preloaded active weights, and computation-involved weights based on available memory. Results show ActiveFlow achieves the performance-cost Pareto frontier compared to existing efficiency optimization methods.</p></details> |  |

Here, we aim to bridge this gap. In particular, we introduce \textsf{SGToxicGuard}, a novel dataset and evaluation framework for benchmarking LLM safety in Singapore's diverse linguistic context, including Singlish, Chinese, Malay, and Tamil. SGToxicGuard adopts a red-teaming approach to systematically probe LLM vulnerabilities in three real-world scenarios: \textit{conversation}, \textit{question-answering}, and \textit{content composition}. We conduct extensive experiments with state-of-the-art multilingual LLMs, and the results uncover critical gaps in their safety guardrails. By offering actionable insights into cultural sensitivity and toxicity mitigation, we lay the foundation for safer and more inclusive AI systems in linguistically diverse environments.\footnote{Link to the dataset: https://github.com/Social-AI-Studio/SGToxicGuard.} \textcolor{red}{Disclaimer: This paper contains sensitive content that may be disturbing to some readers.}</p></details> | 9 pages, EMNLP 2025 |

Exploring the Idiom Understanding of LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16216v2)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Idioms have long posed a challenge due to their unique linguistic properties, which set them apart from other common expressions. While recent studies have leveraged large language models (LLMs) to handle idioms across various tasks, e.g., idiom-containing sentence generation and idiomatic machine translation, little is known about the underlying mechanisms of idiom processing in LLMs, particularly in multilingual settings. To this end, we introduce MIDAS, a new large-scale dataset of idioms in six languages, each paired with its corresponding meaning. Leveraging this resource, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs' idiom processing ability, identifying key factors that influence their performance. Our findings suggest that LLMs rely not only on memorization, but also adopt a hybrid approach that integrates contextual cues and reasoning, especially when processing compositional idioms. This implies that idiom understanding in LLMs emerges from an interplay between internal knowledge retrieval and reasoning-based inference.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 |

Model merging seeks to combine multiple expert models into a single, more capable model, reducing storage and serving costs while supporting decentralized development. Despite its potential, previous studies have primarily focused on merging visual classification models or Large Language Models (LLMs) for code and math tasks. Recently, Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) that extend LLMs through large-scale multimodal training have gained traction. However, there lacks a benchmark for model merging research that clearly divides the tasks for MLLM training and evaluation. In this paper, $\textbf{(i)}$ we introduce a model merging benchmark for MLLMs, which includes multiple tasks such as VQA, Geometry, Chart, OCR, and Grounding, studying both LoRA and full fine-tuning models. Moreover, we explore how model merging can combine different modalities (e.g., vision-language, audio-language, and video-language models), moving toward the Omni-language model. $\textbf{(ii)}$ We implement 10 model merging algorithms on the benchmark. Furthermore, we propose a novel method that removes noise from task vectors and robustly optimizes the merged vector based on a loss defined over task vector interactions, achieving an average performance gain of 2.48%. $\textbf{(iii)}$ We find that model merging offers a promising way for building improved MLLMs without requiring training data. Our results also demonstrate that the complementarity among multiple modalities outperforms individual modalities.</p></details> |  |

By framing transaction risk as a multi-step Markov Decision Process (MDP), RL optimizes risk detection across multiple payment stages. Crafting effective reward functions, essential for RL model success, typically requires significant human expertise due to the complexity and variability in design. LLMs, with their advanced reasoning and coding capabilities, are well-suited to refine these functions, offering improvements over traditional methods. Our approach leverages LLMs to iteratively enhance reward functions, achieving better fraud detection accuracy and demonstrating zero-shot capability. Experiments with real-world data confirm the effectiveness, robustness, and resilience of our LLM-enhanced RL framework through long-term evaluations, underscoring the potential of LLMs in advancing industrial RL applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 12 figures, ACL 2025 industry track</p></details> |

While these capabilities offer exciting opportunities, they also raise critical concerns about fairness and reliability. In this paper, we investigate bias in LLM-generated peer reviews by conducting controlled experiments on sensitive metadata, including author affiliation and gender. Our analysis consistently shows affiliation bias favoring institutions highly ranked on common academic rankings. Additionally, we find some gender preferences, which, even though subtle in magnitude, have the potential to compound over time. Notably, we uncover implicit biases that become more evident with token-based soft ratings.</p></details> |  |

Building upon these advances, this paper explores how large language models (LLMs) can serve as an integrative bridge to connect and integrate information from multiple MIR tools, with a focus on enhancing automatic chord recognition performance. We present a novel approach that positions text-based LLMs as intelligent coordinators that process and integrate outputs from diverse state-of-the-art MIR tools-including music source separation, key detection, chord recognition, and beat tracking. Our method converts audio-derived musical information into textual representations, enabling LLMs to perform reasoning and correction specifically for chord recognition tasks. We design a 5-stage chain-of-thought framework that allows GPT-4o to systematically analyze, compare, and refine chord recognition results by leveraging music-theoretical knowledge to integrate information across different MIR components. Experimental evaluation on three datasets demonstrates consistent improvements across multiple evaluation metrics, with overall accuracy gains of 1-2.77% on the MIREX metric. Our findings demonstrate that LLMs can effectively function as integrative bridges in MIR pipelines, opening new directions for multi-tool coordination in music information retrieval tasks.</p></details> |  |

While streaming intermediate results between computation kernels can significantly improve efficiency, existing approaches struggle with inter-kernel correlations, external memory access management, and buffer optimization. In this work, we propose StreamTensor, a compiler framework that automatically constructs and optimizes stream-based dataflow accelerators. StreamTensor introduces a novel iterative tensor type system to explicitly encode stream layouts, enabling seamless kernel fusion, buffer allocation, and memory optimization. By systematically exploring three hierarchical design spaces, including tensor tiling, kernel fusion, and resource allocation, StreamTensor balances computational intensity, memory efficiency, and data streaming to maximize performance. Based on FPGA evaluations on Large Language Models (LLM), StreamTensor achieves up to 0.76x and 0.64x lower latency compared to the state-of-the-art FPGA LLM accelerators and GPUs, and up to 1.99x higher energy efficiency compared to GPUs, making it a promising approach for scalable dataflow-based deep learning acceleration.</p></details> | Accepted by MICRO'25 |

Past few years have seen a flurry of post-hoc methods for generating model explanations, many of which involve computing model gradients or solving specially designed optimization problems. However, owing to the remarkable reasoning abilities of Large Language Model (LLMs), self-explanation, that is, prompting the model to explain its outputs has recently emerged as a new paradigm. In this work, we study a specific type of self-explanations, self-generated counterfactual explanations (SCEs). We design tests for measuring the efficacy of LLMs in generating SCEs. Analysis over various LLM families, model sizes, temperature settings, and datasets reveals that LLMs sometimes struggle to generate SCEs. Even when they do, their prediction often does not agree with their own counterfactual reasoning.</p></details> |  |

We present \textbf{Agentic AutoSurvey}, a multi-agent framework for automated survey generation that addresses fundamental limitations in existing approaches. Our system employs four specialized agents (Paper Search Specialist, Topic Mining \& Clustering, Academic Survey Writer, and Quality Evaluator) working in concert to generate comprehensive literature surveys with superior synthesis quality. Through experiments on six representative LLM research topics from COLM 2024 categories, we demonstrate that our multi-agent approach achieves significant improvements over existing baselines, scoring 8.18/10 compared to AutoSurvey's 4.77/10. The multi-agent architecture processes 75--443 papers per topic (847 total across six topics) while targeting high citation coverage (often $\geq$80\% on 75--100-paper sets; lower on very large sets such as RLHF) through specialized agent orchestration. Our 12-dimension evaluation captures organization, synthesis integration, and critical analysis beyond basic metrics.

This lack of reliability may limit its deployment in many applications. This work presents the first framework to analyze the uncertainty by offering a prediction interval of LLM-based scoring via conformal prediction. Conformal prediction constructs continuous prediction intervals from a single evaluation run, and we design an ordinal boundary adjustment for discrete rating tasks. We also suggest a midpoint-based score within the interval as a low-bias alternative to raw model score and weighted average. We perform extensive experiments and analysis, which show that conformal prediction can provide valid prediction interval with coverage guarantees. We also explore the usefulness of interval midpoint and judge reprompting for better judgment.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in EMNLP 2025.

Existing benchmarks such as the Berkeley Function Calling Leaderboard (BFCL), tau^2-Bench (arXiv:2506.07982), and ACEBench (arXiv:2501.12851) evaluate argument correctness but do not test adherence to format instructions embedded in parameter descriptions, such as enclosing values in double quotes or using ISO date formats. We introduce IFEval-FC, a benchmark inspired by IFEval (arXiv:2311.07911) that assesses precise instruction following in function calling. IFEval-FC encodes verifiable formats directly within JSON schema descriptions, for example specifying that a value must not contain punctuation. It includes 750 test cases, each consisting of a function with an embedded format for one of its input parameters and a corresponding user query. Evaluation is fully algorithmic, ensuring objectivity, reproducibility, and scalability. Our results show that even state-of-the-art proprietary models, including GPT-5 and Claude 4.1 Opus, frequently fail to follow basic formatting rules, highlighting a practical limitation for real-world agent systems. The complete codebase and data are publicly available at https://github.com/Skripkon/IFEval-FC.</p></details> |  |

These issues often stem from an incomplete understanding of user goals and inadequate comprehension of tool documentation. While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has proven effective for enhancing reasoning in general contexts, our analysis reveals that free-form CoT is insufficient and sometimes counterproductive for structured function-calling tasks. To address this, we introduce a curriculum-inspired framework that leverages structured reasoning templates to guide LLMs through more deliberate step-by-step instructions for generating function callings. Experimental results show that our method reduces tool-use errors, achieving 3-12% relative improvements over strong baselines across diverse model series and approaches. Moreover, our framework enhances the robustness, interpretability, and transparency of tool-using agents, advancing the development of more reliable AI assistants for real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2025 Main Conference</p></details> |

Issue localization forms the basis for accurate issue solving. Recently, LLM-based issue localization methods have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance. However, these methods either search from files mentioned in issue descriptions or in the whole repository and struggle to balance the breadth and depth of the search space to converge on the target efficiently. Moreover, they allow LLM to explore whole repositories freely, making it challenging to control the search direction to prevent the LLM from searching for incorrect targets. This paper introduces CoSIL, an LLM-driven, powerful function-level issue localization method without training or indexing. CoSIL employs a two-phase code graph search strategy. It first conducts broad exploration at the file level using dynamically constructed module call graphs, and then performs in-depth analysis at the function level by expanding the module call graph into a function call graph and executing iterative searches. To precisely control the search direction, CoSIL designs a pruner to filter unrelated directions and irrelevant contexts. To avoid incorrect interaction formats in long contexts, CoSIL introduces a reflection mechanism that uses additional independent queries in short contexts to enhance formatted abilities. Experiment results demonstrate that CoSIL achieves a Top-1 localization accuracy of 43.3\% and 44.6\% on SWE-bench Lite and SWE-bench Verified, respectively, with Qwen2.5-Coder-32B, average outperforming the state-of-the-art methods by 96.04\%. When CoSIL is integrated into an issue-solving method, Agentless, the issue resolution rate improves by 2.98\%--30.5\%.</p></details> | Accepted by ASE 2025 |

This greatly expands their abilities as various agents. However, LLMs rely entirely on the text descriptions of tools to decide which ones to use--a process that is surprisingly fragile. In this work, we expose a vulnerability in prevalent tool/function-calling protocols by investigating a series of edits to tool descriptions, some of which can drastically increase a tool's usage from LLMs when competing with alternatives. Through controlled experiments, we show that tools with properly edited descriptions receive over 10 times more usage from GPT-4.1 and Qwen2.5-7B than tools with original descriptions. We further evaluate how various edits to tool descriptions perform when competing directly with one another and how these trends generalize or differ across a broader set of 17 different models. These phenomena, while giving developers a powerful way to promote their tools, underscore the need for a more reliable foundation for agentic LLMs to select and utilize tools and resources.

These models are usually developed by optimization experts but are used by practitioners without optimization expertise in various application domains. As a result, practitioners often struggle to interact with and draw useful conclusions from optimization models independently. To fill this gap, we introduce OptiChat, a natural language dialogue system designed to help practitioners interpret model formulation, diagnose infeasibility, analyze sensitivity, retrieve information, evaluate modifications, and provide counterfactual explanations. By augmenting large language models (LLMs) with functional calls and code generation tailored for optimization models, we enable seamless interaction and minimize the risk of hallucinations in OptiChat. We develop a new dataset to evaluate OptiChat's performance in explaining optimization models. Experiments demonstrate that OptiChat effectively bridges the gap between optimization models and practitioners, delivering autonomous, accurate, and instant responses.</p></details> |  |
| **[World Modelling Improves Language Model Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02918v2)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tool use in stateful environments presents unique challenges for large language models (LLMs), where existing test-time compute strategies relying on repeated trials in the environment are impractical. We propose dynamics modelling (DyMo), a method that augments LLMs with a state prediction capability alongside function calling during post-training. This enables LLMs to predict the future states of their actions through an internal environment model. On the Berkeley Function Calling Leaderboard V2, DyMo improves success rates and significantly reduces hallucinations. We further integrate the internal environment model into self-verification sampling (SVS), and show that this substantially improves pass^k over number of trials k, and allows the model to refuse unreliable outputs. Together, DyMo and SVS greatly enhance the effectiveness and reliability of LLMs for tool use. We believe this work charts a path towards scalable planning RL methods for LLM inference without repeatedly querying the oracle environment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Digging Into the Internal: Causality-Based Analysis of LLM Function Calling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16268v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Function calling (FC) has emerged as a powerful technique for facilitating large language models (LLMs) to interact with external systems and perform structured tasks. However, the mechanisms through which it influences model behavior remain largely under-explored. Besides, we discover that in addition to the regular usage of FC, this technique can substantially enhance the compliance of LLMs with user instructions. These observations motivate us to leverage causality, a canonical analysis method, to investigate how FC works within LLMs. In particular, we conduct layer-level and token-level causal interventions to dissect FC's impact on the model's internal computational logic when responding to user queries. Our analysis confirms the substantial influence of FC and reveals several in-depth insights into its mechanisms. To further validate our findings, we conduct extensive experiments comparing the effectiveness of FC-based instructions against conventional prompting methods. We focus on enhancing LLM safety robustness, a critical LLM application scenario, and evaluate four mainstream LLMs across two benchmark datasets. The results are striking: FC shows an average performance improvement of around 135% over conventional prompting methods in detecting malicious inputs, demonstrating its promising potential to enhance LLM reliability and capability in practical applications.</p></details> |  |

However, existing agent evaluations largely overlook cultural and linguistic diversity, often relying on monolingual or naively translated benchmarks. We introduce Ticket-Bench, a benchmark for multilingual agent evaluation in task-oriented scenarios. Ticket-Bench simulates the domain of soccer ticket purchases across six major languages: Portuguese, English, Spanish, German, Italian, and French. Using localized teams, cities, and user profiles to provide a higher level of realism. We evaluate a wide range of commercial and open-source LLMs, measuring function-calling accuracy and consistency across languages. Results show that reasoning-oriented models (e.g., GPT-5, Qwen3-235B) dominate performance but still exhibit notable cross-lingual disparities. These findings underscore the need for culturally aware, multilingual benchmarks to guide the development of robust LLM agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-Guided Function Calling in Large Language Models via Stepwise Experience Recall](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15214v2)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Function calling enables large language models (LLMs) to interact with external systems by leveraging tools and APIs. When faced with multi-step tool usage, LLMs still struggle with tool selection, parameter generation, and tool-chain planning. Existing methods typically rely on manually designing task-specific demonstrations, or retrieving from a curated library. These approaches demand substantial expert effort and prompt engineering becomes increasingly complex and inefficient as tool diversity and task difficulty scale. To address these challenges, we propose a self-guided method, Stepwise Experience Recall (SEER), which performs fine-grained, stepwise retrieval from a continually updated experience pool. Instead of relying on static or manually curated library, SEER incrementally augments the experience pool with past successful trajectories, enabling continuous expansion of the pool and improved model performance over time. Evaluated on the ToolQA benchmark, SEER achieves an average improvement of 6.1% on easy and 4.7% on hard questions. We further test SEER on $\tau$-bench, which includes two real-world domains. Powered by Qwen2.5-7B and Qwen2.5-72B models, SEER demonstrates substantial accuracy gains of 7.44% and 23.38%, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2025</p></details> |
| **[Towards General Agentic Intelligence via Environment Scaling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13311v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advanced agentic intelligence is a prerequisite for deploying Large Language Models in practical, real-world applications. Diverse real-world APIs demand precise, robust function-calling intelligence, which needs agents to develop these capabilities through interaction in varied environments. The breadth of function-calling competence is closely tied to the diversity of environments in which agents are trained. In this work, we scale up environments as a step towards advancing general agentic intelligence. This gives rise to two central challenges: (i) how to scale environments in a principled manner, and (ii) how to effectively train agentic capabilities from experiences derived through interactions with these environments. To address these, we design a scalable framework that automatically constructs heterogeneous environments that are fully simulated, systematically broadening the space of function-calling scenarios. We further adapt a two-phase agent fine-tuning strategy: first endowing agents with fundamental agentic capabilities, then specializing them for domain-specific contexts. Extensive experiments on agentic benchmarks, tau-bench, tau2-Bench, and ACEBench, demonstrate that our trained model, AgentScaler, significantly enhances the function-calling capability of models.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://tongyi-agent.github.io/blog/introducing-tongyi-deep-research/</p></details> |

This study aims to address these gaps by providing a comprehensive enterprise-specific benchmark evaluating 18 distinct agentic configurations across state-of-the-art large language models. We examine four critical agentic system dimensions: orchestration strategy, agent prompt implementation (ReAct versus function calling), memory architecture, and thinking tool integration. Our benchmark reveals significant model-specific architectural preferences that challenge the prevalent one-size-fits-all paradigm in agentic AI systems. It also reveals significant weaknesses in overall agentic performance on enterprise tasks with the highest scoring models achieving a maximum of only 35.3\% success on the more complex task and 70.8\% on the simpler task. We hope these findings inform the design of future agentic systems by enabling more empirically backed decisions regarding architectural components and model selection.</p></details> |  |
| **[GeoJSON Agents:A Multi-Agent LLM Architecture for Geospatial Analysis-Function Calling vs Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08863v2)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs have made substantial progress in task automation and natural language understanding. However, without expertise in GIS, they continue to encounter limitations. To address these issues, we propose GeoJSON Agents-a multi-agent LLM architecture. This framework transforms natural language tasks into structured GeoJSON operation commands and processes spatial data using two widely adopted LLM enhancement techniques: Function Calling and Code Generation. The architecture consists of three components-task parsing, agent collaboration, and result integration-aimed at enhancing both the performance and scalability of GIS automation. The Planner agent interprets natural language tasks into structured GeoJSON commands. Then, specialized Worker agents collaborate according to assigned roles to perform spatial data processing and analysis, either by invoking predefined function APIs or by dynamically generating and executing Python-based spatial analysis code. Finally, the system integrates the outputs from multiple execution rounds into reusable, standards-compliant GeoJSON files. To systematically evaluate the performance of the two approaches, we constructed a benchmark dataset of 70 tasks with varying complexity and conducted experiments using OpenAI's GPT-4o as the core model. Results indicate that the Function Calling-based GeoJSON Agent achieved an accuracy of 85.71%, while the Code Generation-based agent reached 97.14%, both significantly outperforming the best-performing general-purpose model (48.57%). Further analysis reveals that the Code Generation provides greater flexibility, whereas the Function Calling approach offers more stable execution. This study is the first to introduce an LLM multi-agent framework for GeoJSON data and to compare the strengths and limitations of two mainstream LLM enhancement methods, offering new perspectives for improving GeoAI system performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Advancing SLM Tool-Use Capability using Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04518v2)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In an era where tool-augmented AI agents are becoming increasingly vital, our findings highlight the ability of Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to empower SLMs, which are traditionally constrained in tool use. The ability to use tools effectively has become a defining feature of Large Language Models (LLMs), allowing them to access external data and internal resources. As AI agents grow more sophisticated, tool-use capabilities have become indispensable. While LLMs have made significant progress in this area, Small Language Models (SLMs) still face challenges in accurately integrating tool use, especially in resource-constrained settings. This study investigates how Reinforcement Learning, specifically Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), can enhance the tool-use accuracy of SLMs. By designing a well-defined reward system that reinforces structured JSON output, correct tool selection, and precise parameter usage, we demonstrate that GRPO enables SLMs to achieve significant improvements in tool-use capabilities (function calling/JSON output). Our approach provides a computationally efficient training method that enhances SLMs practical deployment in real-world AI applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[VehicleWorld: A Highly Integrated Multi-Device Environment for Intelligent Vehicle Interaction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06736v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Intelligent vehicle cockpits present unique challenges for API Agents, requiring coordination across tightly-coupled subsystems that exceed typical task environments' complexity. Traditional Function Calling (FC) approaches operate statelessly, requiring multiple exploratory calls to build environmental awareness before execution, leading to inefficiency and limited error recovery. We introduce VehicleWorld, the first comprehensive environment for the automotive domain, featuring 30 modules, 250 APIs, and 680 properties with fully executable implementations that provide real-time state information during agent execution. This environment enables precise evaluation of vehicle agent behaviors across diverse, challenging scenarios. Through systematic analysis, we discovered that direct state prediction outperforms function calling for environmental control. Building on this insight, we propose State-based Function Call (SFC), a novel approach that maintains explicit system state awareness and implements direct state transitions to achieve target conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that SFC significantly outperforms traditional FC approaches, achieving superior execution accuracy and reduced latency. We have made all implementation code publicly available on Github https://github.com/OpenMOSS/VehicleWorld.</p></details> |  |
| **[GRACE: Graph-Guided Repository-Aware Code Completion through Hierarchical Code Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05980v1)** | 2025-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs excel in localized code completion but struggle with repository-level tasks due to limited context windows and complex semantic and structural dependencies across codebases. While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates context scarcity by retrieving relevant code snippets, current approaches face significant limitations. They overly rely on textual similarity for retrieval, neglecting structural relationships such as call chains and inheritance hierarchies, and lose critical structural information by naively concatenating retrieved snippets into text sequences for LLM input. To address these shortcomings, GRACE constructs a multi-level, multi-semantic code graph that unifies file structures, abstract syntax trees, function call graphs, class hierarchies, and data flow graphs to capture both static and dynamic code semantics. For retrieval, GRACE employs a Hybrid Graph Retriever that integrates graph neural network-based structural similarity with textual retrieval, refined by a graph attention network-based re-ranker to prioritize topologically relevant subgraphs. To enhance context, GRACE introduces a structural fusion mechanism that merges retrieved subgraphs with the local code context and preserves essential dependencies like function calls and inheritance. Extensive experiments on public repository-level benchmarks demonstrate that GRACE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across all metrics. Using DeepSeek-V3 as the backbone LLM, GRACE surpasses the strongest graph-based RAG baselines by 8.19% EM and 7.51% ES points on every dataset. The code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/grace_icse-C3D5.</p></details> |  |
| **[Relative-error monotonicity testing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09235v2)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The standard model of Boolean function property testing is not well suited for testing $\textit{sparse}$ functions which have few satisfying assignments, since every such function is close (in the usual Hamming distance metric) to the constant-0 function. In this work we propose and investigate a new model for property testing of Boolean functions, called $\textit{relative-error testing}$, which provides a natural framework for testing sparse functions. This new model defines the distance between two functions $f, g: \{0,1\}^n \to \{0,1\}$ to be $$\textsf{reldist}(f,g) := { \frac{|f^{-1}(1) \triangle g^{-1}(1)|} {|f^{-1}(1)|}}.$$ This is a more demanding distance measure than the usual Hamming distance ${ {|f^{-1}(1) \triangle g^{-1}(1)|}/{2^n}}$ when $|f^{-1}(1)| \ll 2^n$; to compensate for this, algorithms in the new model have access both to a black-box oracle for the function $f$ being tested and to a source of independent uniform satisfying assignments of $f$. In this paper we first give a few general results about the relative-error testing model; then, as our main technical contribution, we give a detailed study of algorithms and lower bounds for relative-error testing of $\textit{monotone}$ Boolean functions. We give upper and lower bounds which are parameterized by $N=|f^{-1}(1)|$, the sparsity of the function $f$ being tested. Our results show that there are interesting differences between relative-error monotonicity testing of sparse Boolean functions, and monotonicity testing in the standard model. These results motivate further study of the testability of Boolean function properties in the relative-error model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Updated non-adaptive lower bound argument in Section 5; results are unchanged</p></details> |

This paper presents GridMind, a multi-agent AI system that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with deterministic engineering solvers to enable conversational scientific computing for power system analysis. The system employs specialized agents coordinating AC Optimal Power Flow and N-1 contingency analysis through natural language interfaces while maintaining numerical precision via function calls. GridMind addresses workflow integration, knowledge accessibility, context preservation, and expert decision-support augmentation. Experimental evaluation on IEEE test cases demonstrates that the proposed agentic framework consistently delivers correct solutions across all tested language models, with smaller LLMs achieving comparable analytical accuracy with reduced computational latency. This work establishes agentic AI as a viable paradigm for scientific computing, demonstrating how conversational interfaces can enhance accessibility while preserving numerical rigor essential for critical engineering applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 9 figures, 2 tables.

This paper identifies four core problems that must be solved for mobile agents to deliver practical, scalable impact: (1) generalization across tasks, modalities, apps, and devices; (2) accuracy, specifically precise on-screen interaction and click targeting; (3) long-horizon capability for sustained, multi-step goals; and (4) efficiency, specifically high-performance runtime on resource-constrained devices. We present AppCopilot, a multimodal, multi-agent, general-purpose on-device assistant that operates across applications and constitutes a full-stack, closed-loop system from data to deployment. AppCopilot operationalizes this position through an end-to-end autonomous pipeline spanning data collection, training, deployment, high-quality and efficient inference, and mobile application development. At the model layer, it integrates multimodal foundation models with robust Chinese-English support. At the reasoning and control layer, it combines chain-of-thought reasoning, hierarchical task planning and decomposition, and multi-agent collaboration. At the execution layer, it enables user personalization and experiential adaptation, voice interaction, function calling, cross-app and cross-device orchestration, and comprehensive mobile app support. The system design incorporates profiling-driven optimization for latency, memory, and energy across heterogeneous hardware. Empirically, AppCopilot achieves significant improvements along all four dimensions: stronger generalization, higher-precision on-screen actions, more reliable long-horizon task completion, and faster, more resource-efficient runtime.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project at https://github.com/OpenBMB/AppCopilot</p></details> |

Existing methods often oversimplify programs into single level graphs, failing to model the crucial semantic relationship between high-level functional interactions and low-level instruction logic. To bridge this gap, we introduce \dataset, the largest public hierarchical graph dataset for malware analysis, comprising over \textbf{200M} Control Flow Graphs (CFGs) nested within \textbf{595K} Function Call Graphs (FCGs). This two-level representation preserves structural semantics essential for building robust detectors resilient to code obfuscation and malware evolution. We demonstrate HiGraph's utility through a large-scale analysis that reveals distinct structural properties of benign and malicious software, establishing it as a foundational benchmark for the community. The dataset and tools are publicly available at https://higraph.org.</p></details> |  |

This paper proposes a method for combining e-processes constructed in different filtrations but for the same null. Although e-processes in the same filtration can be combined effortlessly (by averaging), e-processes in different filtrations cannot because their validity in a coarser filtration does not translate to a finer filtration. This issue arises in sequential tests of randomness and independence, as well as in the evaluation of sequential forecasters. We establish that a class of functions called adjusters can lift arbitrary e-processes across filtrations. The result yields a generally applicable "adjust-then-combine" procedure, which we demonstrate on the problem of testing randomness in real-world financial data. Furthermore, we prove a characterization theorem for adjusters that formalizes a sense in which using adjusters is necessary. There are two major implications. First, if we have a powerful e-process in a coarsened filtration, then we readily have a powerful e-process in the original filtration. Second, when we coarsen the filtration to construct an e-process, there is a logarithmic cost to recovering validity in the original filtration.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review.

A Study on $τ$-bench](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20931v2)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in reasoning and planning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have enabled their potential as autonomous agents capable of tool use in dynamic environments. However, in multi-turn conversational environments like $\tau$-bench, these agents often struggle with consistent reasoning, adherence to domain-specific policies, and extracting correct information over a long horizon of tool-calls and conversation. To capture and mitigate these failures, we conduct a comprehensive manual analysis of the common errors occurring in the conversation trajectories. We then experiment with reformulations of inputs to the tool-calling agent for improvement in agent decision making. Finally, we propose the Input-Reformulation Multi-Agent (IRMA) framework, which automatically reformulates user queries augmented with relevant domain rules and tool suggestions for the tool-calling agent to focus on. The results show that IRMA significantly outperforms ReAct, Function Calling, and Self-Reflection by 16.1%, 12.7%, and 19.1%, respectively, in overall pass^5 scores. These findings highlight the superior reliability and consistency of IRMA compared to other methods in dynamic environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2025 Findings</p></details> |

This measure counts the number of correctly ``interpreted" pairs of vertices, i. e. two vertices belonging to the same community and connected by an edge, or two vertices belonging to different communities and not connected by an edge. In this paper, we explore Fortunato's performance measure (fp measure) for detecting communities in unweighted, undirected networks. First, we give a greedy algorithm fpGreed that tries to optimise the fp measure by working iteratively at two-levels, vertex-level and community-level. At the vertex level, a vertex joins a community only if the fp value improves. Once this is done, an initial set of communities are obtained. At the next stage, two communities merge only if the fp measure improves. Once there are no further improvements to be made, the algorithm switches back to the vertex level and so on. fpGreed terminates when there are no changes to any community. We then present a faster heuristic algorithm fastFp more suitable for running on large datasets. We present the quality of the communities and the time it takes to compute them on several well-known datasets. For some of the large datasets, such as youtube and livejournal, we find that Algorithm fastFP performs really well, both in terms of the time and the quality of the solution obtained.</p></details> |  |

In this setting, dialogue agents often produce overly long in-character responses (over-speaking) while failing to use tools effectively according to the persona (under-acting), such as generating function calls that do not exist or making unnecessary tool calls before answering. We explore four prompting approaches to address these issues: 1) basic role prompting, 2) human-crafted role prompting, 3) automatic prompt optimization (APO), and 4) rule-based role prompting. The rule-based role prompting (RRP) approach achieved the best performance through two novel techniques--character-card/scene-contract design and strict enforcement of function calling--which led to an overall score of 0.571, improving on the zero-shot baseline score of 0.519. These findings demonstrate that RRP design can substantially improve the effectiveness and reliability of role-playing dialogue agents compared with more elaborate methods such as APO. To support future efforts in developing persona prompts, we are open-sourcing all of our best-performing prompts and the APO tool.

To this end, we extend transformation methods based on integer TRSs to handle arbitrary data types, global variables, function calls and arrays, as well as encode safety checks. Then we adapt existing rewriting induction methods to LCTRSs and propose a simple yet effective method to generalize equations. We show that we can automatically verify memory safety and prove correctness of realistic functions. Our approach proves equivalence between two implementations, so in contrast to other works, we do not require an explicit specification in a separate specification language.</p></details> |  |

When equipped with tools through function calling and enhanced with retrieval-augmented techniques, compound LLM-based systems can access closed data sources and answer questions about them. However, they still struggle to process and reason over large-scale graph-structure data. We introduce the GDS (Graph Data Science) agent in this technical report. The GDS agent introduces a comprehensive set of graph algorithms as tools, together with preprocessing (retrieval) and postprocessing of algorithm results, in a model context protocol (MCP) server. The server can be used with any modern LLM out-of-the-box. GDS agent allows users to ask any question that implicitly and intrinsically requires graph algorithmic reasoning about their data, and quickly obtain accurate and grounded answers. We also introduce a new benchmark that evaluates intermediate tool calls as well as final responses. The results indicate that GDS agent is able to solve a wide spectrum of graph tasks. We also provide detailed case studies for more open-ended tasks and study scenarios where the agent struggles. Finally, we discuss the remaining challenges and the future roadmap.</p></details> | Technical report |

Overcoming Detection Challenges with Behavioral Function-Aware Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13811v3)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>WebShell attacks, where malicious scripts are injected into web servers, pose a significant cybersecurity threat. Traditional ML and DL methods are often hampered by challenges such as the need for extensive training data, catastrophic forgetting, and poor generalization. Recently, Large Language Models have emerged as powerful alternatives for code-related tasks, but their potential in WebShell detection remains underexplored. In this paper, we make two contributions: (1) a comprehensive evaluation of seven LLMs, including GPT-4, LLaMA 3.1 70B, and Qwen 2.5 variants, benchmarked against traditional sequence- and graph-based methods using a dataset of 26.59K PHP scripts, and (2) the Behavioral Function-Aware Detection (BFAD) framework, designed to address the specific challenges of applying LLMs to this domain. Our framework integrates three components: a Critical Function Filter that isolates malicious PHP function calls, a Context-Aware Code Extraction strategy that captures the most behaviorally indicative code segments, and Weighted Behavioral Function Profiling that enhances in-context learning by prioritizing the most relevant demonstrations based on discriminative function-level profiles. Our results show that, stemming from their distinct analytical strategies, larger LLMs achieve near-perfect precision but lower recall, while smaller models exhibit the opposite trade-off. However, all baseline models lag behind previous SOTA methods. With the application of BFAD, the performance of all LLMs improves significantly, yielding an average F1 score increase of 13.82%. Notably, larger models now outperform SOTA benchmarks, while smaller models such as Qwen-2.5-Coder-3B achieve performance competitive with traditional methods. This work is the first to explore the feasibility and limitations of LLMs for WebShell detection and provides solutions to address the challenges in this task.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at COLM 2025</p></details> |

However, most existing approaches focus on mainstream languages such as Python and Java, neglecting the Solidity language, the predominant programming language for Ethereum smart contracts. Due to the lack of adequate benchmarks for Solidity, LLMs' ability to generate secure, cost-effective smart contracts remains unexplored. To fill this gap, we construct SolEval, the first repository-level benchmark designed for Solidity smart contract generation, to evaluate the performance of LLMs on Solidity. SolEval consists of 1,507 samples from 28 different repositories, covering 6 popular domains, providing LLMs with a comprehensive evaluation benchmark. Unlike the existing Solidity benchmark, SolEval not only includes complex function calls but also reflects the real-world complexity of the Ethereum ecosystem by incorporating Gas@k and Vul@k. We evaluate 16 LLMs on SolEval, and our results show that the best-performing LLM achieves only 26.29% Pass@10, highlighting substantial room for improvement in Solidity code generation by LLMs. Additionally, we conduct supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on Qwen-7B using SolEval, resulting in a significant performance improvement, with Pass@5 increasing from 16.67% to 58.33%, demonstrating the effectiveness of fine-tuning LLMs on our benchmark.

The logic with strong and weak separating conjunctions offers a solid foundation for producing concise and precise proofs. However, it lacks automation and compositionality support. This paper addresses this limitation by introducing a compositional verification system for concurrent programs that manipulate regions of shared memory. The centre of our system is novel logical principles and an entailment procedure that can infer the residual heaps in the frame rule for a fragment of CSL-Perm with explicit arithmetical constraints for memory heaps' disjointness. This procedure enables the compositional reasoning for concurrent threads and function calls. We have implemented the proposal in a prototype tool called CoSl, tested it with 10 challenging concurrent programs, including those beyond the state-of-the-art, and confirmed the advantage of our approach.</p></details> |  |

This report examines its three major CPU models: the AtomicSimpleCPU (AS CPU), the TimingSimpleCPU (TS CPU), the Out-of-order (O3) CPU, and their interactions with the memory subsystem. We provide a detailed anatomical overview of each CPU's function call-chains and present how gem5 partitions its execution time for each simulated hardware layer. We perform our analysis using a lightweight profiler built on Linux's perf_event interface, with user-configurable options to target specific functions and examine their interactions in detail. By profiling each CPU across a wide selection of benchmarks, we identify their software bottlenecks. Our results show that the Ruby memory subsystem consistently accounts for the largest share of execution time in the sequential AS and TS CPUs, primarily during the instruction fetch stage. In contrast, the O3 CPU spends a relatively smaller fraction of time in Ruby, with most of its time devoted to constructing instruction instances and the various pipeline stages of the CPU. We believe that the anatomical view of each CPU's execution flow is valuable for educational purposes, as it clearly illustrates the interactions among simulated components. These insights form a foundation for optimizing gem5's performance, particularly for the AS, TS, and O3 CPUs. Moreover, our framework can be readily applied to analyze other gem5 components or to develop and evaluate new models.</p></details> |  |
| **[RepoMaster: Autonomous Exploration and Understanding of GitHub Repositories for Complex Task Solving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21577v3)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ultimate goal of code agents is to solve complex tasks autonomously. Although large language models (LLMs) have made substantial progress in code generation, real-world tasks typically demand full-fledged code repositories rather than simple scripts. Building such repositories from scratch remains a major challenge. Fortunately, GitHub hosts a vast, evolving collection of open-source repositories, which developers frequently reuse as modular components for complex tasks. Yet, existing frameworks like OpenHands and SWE-Agent still struggle to effectively leverage these valuable resources. Relying solely on README files provides insufficient guidance, and deeper exploration reveals two core obstacles: overwhelming information and tangled dependencies of repositories, both constrained by the limited context windows of current LLMs. To tackle these issues, we propose RepoMaster, an autonomous agent framework designed to explore and reuse GitHub repositories for solving complex tasks. For efficient understanding, RepoMaster constructs function-call graphs, module-dependency graphs, and hierarchical code trees to identify essential components, providing only identified core elements to the LLMs rather than the entire repository. During autonomous execution, it progressively explores related components using our exploration tools and prunes information to optimize context usage. Evaluated on the adjusted MLE-bench, RepoMaster achieves a 110% relative boost in valid submissions over the strongest baseline OpenHands. On our newly released GitTaskBench, RepoMaster lifts the task-pass rate from 40.7% to 62.9% while reducing token usage by 95%. Our code and demonstration materials are publicly available at https://github.com/QuantaAlpha/RepoMaster.</p></details> | <details><summary>A nov...</summary><p>A novel approach; Very practical</p></details> |
| **[Beyond Semantic Similarity: Reducing Unnecessary API Calls via Behavior-Aligned Retriever](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14323v2)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tool-augmented large language models (LLMs) leverage external functions to extend their capabilities, but inaccurate function calls can lead to inefficiencies and increased costs.Existing methods address this challenge by fine-tuning LLMs or using demonstration-based prompting, yet they often suffer from high training overhead and fail to account for inconsistent demonstration samples, which misguide the model's invocation behavior. In this paper, we trained a behavior-aligned retriever (BAR), which provides behaviorally consistent demonstrations to help LLMs make more accurate tool-using decisions. To train the BAR, we construct a corpus including different function-calling behaviors, i.e., calling or non-calling.We use the contrastive learning framework to train the BAR with customized positive/negative pairs and a dual-negative contrastive loss, ensuring robust retrieval of behaviorally consistent examples.Experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces erroneous function calls while maintaining high task performance, offering a cost-effective and efficient solution for tool-augmented LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[PowerChain: Automating Distribution Grid Analysis with Agentic AI Workflows](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17094v1)** | 2025-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the rapid pace of electrification and decarbonization, distribution grid (DG) operation and planning are becoming more complex, necessitating advanced computational analyses to ensure grid reliability and resilience. State-of-the-art DG analyses rely on disparate workflows of complex models, functions, and data pipelines, which require expert knowledge and are challenging to automate. Many small-scale utilities and cooperatives lack a large R&D workforce and therefore cannot use advanced analysis at scale. To address this gap, we develop a novel agentic AI system, PowerChain, to solve unseen DG analysis tasks via automated agentic orchestration and large language models (LLMs) function-calling. Given a natural language query, PowerChain dynamically generates and executes an ordered sequence of domain-aware functions guided by the semantics of an expert-built power systems function pool and a select reference set of known, expert-generated workflow-query pairs. Our results show that PowerChain can produce expert-level workflows with both GPT-5 and open-source Qwen models on complex, unseen DG analysis tasks operating on real utility data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Proto-Quipper with Reversing and Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22261v2)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The quantum programming language Quipper supports circuit operations such as reversing and controlling certain quantum circuits. Additionally, Quipper provides a function called with-computed, which can be used to program circuits of the form g; f; g-dagger. The latter is a common pattern in quantum circuit design. One benefit of using with-computed, as opposed to constructing the circuit g ; f; g-dagger directly from g, f, and g-dagger, is that it facilitates an important optimization. Namely, if the resulting circuit is later controlled, only f needs to be controlled; the circuits g and g-dagger need not even be controllable. In this paper, we formalize a semantics for reversible and controllable circuits, using a dagger symmetric monoidal category R to interpret reversible circuits, and a new notion we call a controllable category N, which encompasses the control and with-computed operations in Quipper. We extend the language Proto-Quipper with reversing, control and the with-computed operation. Since not all circuits are reversible and/or controllable, we use a type system with modalities to track reversibility and controllability. This generalizes the modality of Fu-Kishida-Ross-Selinger 2023. We give an abstract categorical semantics, and show that the type system and operational semantics are sound with respect to this semantics.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings QPL 2025, arXiv:2508.13619</p></details> |

Existing simulation-based data generation methods for such scenarios rely heavily on costly autoregressive interactions between multiple LLM agents, thereby limiting real-world performance of agentic tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel Non-Autoregressive Iterative Generation framework, called ToolACE-MT, for constructing high-quality multi-turn agentic dialogues. ToolACE-MT generates full conversational trajectories through three stages: coarse-grained initialization, iterative refinement, and offline verification. The initialization phase builds a structurally complete yet semantically coarse dialogue skeleton; the iterative refinement phase introduces realistic complexities and continued refinement via mask-and-fill operations; and the offline verification phase ensures correctness and coherence via rule- and model-based checks. Experiments demonstrate that ToolACE-MT enables efficient, effective and generalizable agentic data generation, offering a new paradigm for high-quality data construction in tool-augmented LLM scenarios.</p></details> |  |

In these settings, the probability distribution arises as the solution to an optimization problem that captures either static interactions among agents or the dynamic evolution of a system over time. We introduce a general methodology based on a new class of loss functions, called sharpened Fenchel-Young losses, which measure the sub-optimality gap of the optimization problem over the space of probability measures. We provide explicit stability guarantees for two relevant settings in the context of optimal transport: The first is inverse unbalanced optimal transport (iUOT) with entropic regularization, where the parameters to estimate are cost functions that govern transport computations; this method has applications such as link prediction in machine learning. The second is inverse gradient flow (iJKO), where the objective is to recover a potential function that drives the evolution of a probability distribution via the Jordan-Kinderlehrer-Otto (JKO) time-discretization scheme; this is particularly relevant for understanding cell population dynamics in single-cell genomics. We also establish source conditions to ensure stability of our method under mirror stratifiable regularizers (such as l1 or nuclear norm) that promote structure. Finally, we present optimization algorithms specifically tailored to efficiently solve iUOT and iJKO problems. We validate our approach through numerical experiments on Gaussian distributions, where closed-form solutions are available, to demonstrate the practical performance of our methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring Superior Function Calls via Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05118v3)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Function calling capabilities are crucial for deploying Large Language Models in real-world applications, yet current training approaches fail to develop robust reasoning strategies. Supervised fine-tuning produces models that rely on superficial pattern matching, while standard reinforcement learning methods struggle with the complex action space of structured function calls. We present a novel reinforcement learning framework designed to enhance group relative policy optimization through strategic entropy based exploration specifically tailored for function calling tasks. Our approach addresses three critical challenges in function calling: insufficient exploration during policy learning, lack of structured reasoning in chain-of-thought generation, and inadequate verification of parameter extraction. Our two-stage data preparation pipeline ensures high-quality training samples through iterative LLM evaluation and abstract syntax tree validation. Extensive experiments on the Berkeley Function Calling Leaderboard demonstrate that this framework achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source models with 86.02\% overall accuracy, outperforming standard GRPO by up to 6\% on complex multi-function scenarios. Notably, our method shows particularly strong improvements on code-pretrained models, suggesting that structured language generation capabilities provide an advantageous starting point for reinforcement learning in function calling tasks. We will release all the code, models and dataset to benefit the community.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hell or High Water: Evaluating Agentic Recovery from External Failures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11027v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As language model agents are applied to real world problems of increasing complexity, they will be expected to formulate plans across large search spaces. If those plans fail for reasons beyond their control, how well do language agents search for alternative ways to achieve their goals? We devise a specialized agentic planning benchmark to study this question. Each planning problem is solved via combinations of function calls. The agent searches for relevant functions from a set of over four thousand possibilities, and observes environmental feedback in the form of function outputs or error messages. Our benchmark confronts the agent with external failures in its workflow, such as functions that suddenly become unavailable. At the same time, even with the introduction of these failures, we guarantee that the task remains solvable. Ideally, an agent's performance on the planning task should not be affected by the presence of external failures. Overall, we find that language agents struggle to formulate and execute backup plans in response to environment feedback. While state-of-the-art models are often able to identify the correct function to use in the right context, they struggle to adapt to feedback from the environment and often fail to pursue alternate courses of action, even when the search space is artificially restricted. We provide a systematic analysis of the failures of both open-source and commercial models, examining the effects of search space size, as well as the benefits of scaling model size in our setting. Our analysis identifies key challenges for current generative models as well as promising directions for future work.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to COLM 2025</p></details> |
| **[Complex Logical Instruction Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09125v1)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Instruction following has catalyzed the recent era of Large Language Models (LLMs) and is the foundational skill underpinning more advanced capabilities such as reasoning and agentic behaviors. As tasks grow more challenging, the logic structures embedded in natural language instructions becomes increasingly intricate. However, how well LLMs perform on such logic-rich instructions remains under-explored. We propose LogicIFGen and LogicIFEval. LogicIFGen is a scalable, automated framework for generating verifiable instructions from code functions, which can naturally express rich logic such as conditionals, nesting, recursion, and function calls. We further curate a collection of complex code functions and use LogicIFGen to construct LogicIFEval, a benchmark comprising 426 verifiable logic-rich instructions. Our experiments demonstrate that current state-of-the-art LLMs still struggle to correctly follow the instructions in LogicIFEval. Most LLMs can only follow fewer than 60% of the instructions, revealing significant deficiencies in the instruction-following ability.

| **[MCPToolBench++: A Large Scale AI Agent Model Context Protocol MCP Tool Use Benchmark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07575v1)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs' capabilities are enhanced by using function calls to integrate various data sources or API results into the context window. Typical tools include search, web crawlers, maps, financial data, file systems, and browser usage, etc. Integrating these data sources or functions requires a standardized method. The Model Context Protocol (MCP) provides a standardized way to supply context to LLMs. However, the evaluation of LLMs and AI Agents' MCP tool use abilities suffer from several issues. First, there's a lack of comprehensive datasets or benchmarks to evaluate various MCP tools. Second, the diverse formats of response from MCP tool call execution further increase the difficulty of evaluation. Additionally, unlike existing tool-use benchmarks with high success rates in functions like programming and math functions, the success rate of real-world MCP tool is not guaranteed and varies across different MCP servers. Furthermore, the LLMs' context window also limits the number of available tools that can be called in a single run, because the textual descriptions of tool and the parameters have long token length for an LLM to process all at once. To help address the challenges of evaluating LLMs' performance on calling MCP tools, we propose MCPToolBench++, a large-scale, multi-domain AI Agent tool use benchmark. As of July 2025, this benchmark is build upon marketplace of over 4k MCP servers from more than 40 categories, collected from the MCP marketplaces and GitHub communities. The datasets consist of both single-step and multi-step tool calls across different categories. We evaluated SOTA LLMs with agentic abilities on this benchmark and reported the results.</p></details> | <details><summary>Bench...</summary><p>Benchmarks and Source Code Released</p></details> |
| **[Mitigating Distribution Shift in Graph-Based Android Malware Classification via Function Metadata and LLM Embeddings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06734v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph-based malware classifiers can achieve over 94% accuracy on standard Android datasets, yet we find they suffer accuracy drops of up to 45% when evaluated on previously unseen malware variants from the same family - a scenario where strong generalization would typically be expected. This highlights a key limitation in existing approaches: both the model architectures and their structure-only representations often fail to capture deeper semantic patterns. In this work, we propose a robust semantic enrichment framework that enhances function call graphs with contextual features, including function-level metadata and, when available, code embeddings derived from large language models. The framework is designed to operate under real-world constraints where feature availability is inconsistent, and supports flexible integration of semantic signals. To evaluate generalization under realistic domain and temporal shifts, we introduce two new benchmarks: MalNet-Tiny-Common and MalNet-Tiny-Distinct, constructed using malware family partitioning to simulate cross-family generalization and evolving threat behavior. Experiments across multiple graph neural network backbones show that our method improves classification performance by up to 8% under distribution shift and consistently enhances robustness when integrated with adaptation-based methods. These results offer a practical path toward building resilient malware detection systems in evolving threat environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 3 figures, 7 tables, under review</p></details> |
| **[CodeARC: Benchmarking Reasoning Capabilities of LLM Agents for Inductive Program Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23145v2)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inductive program synthesis, or programming by example, requires synthesizing functions from input-output examples that generalize to unseen inputs. While large language model agents have shown promise in programming tasks guided by natural language, their ability to perform inductive program synthesis is underexplored. Existing evaluation protocols rely on static sets of examples and held-out tests, offering no feedback when synthesized functions are incorrect and failing to reflect real-world scenarios such as reverse engineering. We propose CodeARC, the Code Abstraction and Reasoning Challenge, a new evaluation framework where agents interact with a hidden target function by querying it with new inputs, synthesizing candidate functions, and iteratively refining their solutions using a differential testing oracle. This interactive setting encourages agents to perform function calls and self-correction based on feedback. We construct the first large-scale benchmark for general-purpose inductive program synthesis, featuring 1114 functions. Among 18 models evaluated, o3-mini performs best with a success rate of 52.7%, highlighting the difficulty of this task. Fine-tuning LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct on curated synthesis traces yields up to a 31% relative performance gain. CodeARC provides a more realistic and challenging testbed for evaluating LLM-based program synthesis and inductive reasoning. Our code, data, and models are publicly available at https://github.com/Anjiang-Wei/CodeARC</p></details> |  |

In contrast to conventional methods that rely on pre-scheduled action sequences or behavior trees, GhostShell drives embodied systems to act on-the-fly by issuing function calls incrementally as tokens are streamed from the LLM. GhostShell features a streaming XML function token parser, a dynamic function interface mapper, and a multi-channel scheduler that orchestrates intra-channel synchronous and inter-channel asynchronous function calls, thereby coordinating serial-parallel embodied actions across multiple robotic components under LLM guidance. We evaluate GhostShell on our robotic prototype COCO through comprehensive grounded experiments across 34 real-world interaction tasks and multiple LLM backends. The results demonstrate that our approach achieves a state-of-the-art Behavioral Correctness Metric of 0.85 with Claude-4-Sonnet, and up to 66X faster response times compared to native LLM function calling APIs. GhostShell also proves effective in long-horizon multimodal tasks, exhibiting strong robustness and generalization capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 5 figures, conference</p></details> |
| **[Calibrating Deep Neural Network using Euclidean Distance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18321v2)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Uncertainty is a fundamental aspect of real-world scenarios, where perfect information is rarely available. Humans naturally develop complex internal models to navigate incomplete data and effectively respond to unforeseen or partially observed events. In machine learning, Focal Loss is commonly used to reduce misclassification rates by emphasizing hard-to-classify samples. However, it does not guarantee well-calibrated predicted probabilities and may result in models that are overconfident or underconfident. High calibration error indicates a misalignment between predicted probabilities and actual outcomes, affecting model reliability. This research introduces a novel loss function called Focal Calibration Loss (FCL), designed to improve probability calibration while retaining the advantages of Focal Loss in handling difficult samples. By minimizing the Euclidean norm through a strictly proper loss, FCL penalizes the instance-wise calibration error and constrains bounds. We provide theoretical validation for proposed method and apply it to calibrate CheXNet for potential deployment in web-based health-care systems. Extensive evaluations on various models and datasets demonstrate that our method achieves SOTA performance in both calibration and accuracy metrics.</p></details> | V2 |

Although deep learning models are prevalent in stock recommendation systems, traditional time-series forecasting training often fails to capture stock trends and rankings simultaneously, which are essential consideration factors for investors. To tackle this issue, we introduce a Multi-Task Learning (MTL) framework for stock recommendation, \textbf{M}omentum-\textbf{i}ntegrated \textbf{M}ulti-task \textbf{Stoc}k \textbf{R}ecommendation with Converge-based Optimization (\textbf{MiM-StocR}). To improve the model's ability to capture short-term trends, we novelly invoke a momentum line indicator in model training. To prioritize top-performing stocks and optimize investment allocation, we propose a list-wise ranking loss function called Adaptive-k ApproxNDCG. Moreover, due to the volatility and uncertainty of the stock market, existing MTL frameworks face overfitting issues when applied to stock time series. To mitigate this issue, we introduce the Converge-based Quad-Balancing (CQB) method. We conducted extensive experiments on three stock benchmarks: SEE50, CSI 100, and CSI 300. MiM-StocR outperforms state-of-the-art MTL baselines across both ranking and profitable evaluations.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |

Among these, program-guided reasoning, by decomposing claims into function calls and executing reasoning programs, which has shown particular promise, but remains limited by the need for manually crafted demonstrations. Fundamentally, the underlying principles of effective reasoning program generation still remain underexplored. In this work, we introduce BOOST, a bootstrapping approach for automated few-shot reasoning program generation. BOOST iteratively refines explicit, data-driven guidelines as meta-rules for guiding demonstration creation, using a critique-refine loop that eliminates the need for human intervention. This enables a seamless transition from zero-shot to few-shot program-guided learning, enhancing interpretability and effectiveness. Experimental results show that BOOST outperforms prior few-shot baselines in both zero-shot and few-shot settings for complex claim verification.</p></details> | Work in Progress |

In this paper, we revisit an algorithm for solving linear diophantine equations in two variables, which we refer as DEA-R algorithm. The DEA-R algorithm always incurs equal or less number of recursions or recursive calls as compared to extended euclidean algorithm. With the objective of taking advantage of the less number of recursive calls , we propose an optimized version of the DEA-R algorithm as DEA-OPTD. In the recursive function calls in DEA-OPTD, we propose a sequence of more efficient computations. We do a theoretical comparison of the execution times of DEA-OPTD algorithm and DEA-R algorithm to find any possible bound on the value of $c$ for DEA-OPTD being better than DEA-R. We implement and compare an iterative version of DEA-OPTD (DEA-OPTDI) with two versions of a widely used algorithm on an specific input setting. In this comparison, we find out that our algorithm outperforms on the other algorithm against atleast 96% of the inputs.</p></details> |  |

Current approaches require extensive manual configuration, introduce significant boilerplate, and often lack support for recursive calls and object-oriented programming (OOP) constructs-features critical for productive, multi-language development. We present Kernel-FFI, a transparent, language-agnostic framework that enables seamless cross-language function calls and object manipulation within interactive notebooks. Kernel-FFI employs source-level transformation to automatically rewrite cross-language invocations, eliminating the need for manual bindings or boilerplate. Kernel-FFI provides robust support for OOP by enabling foreign object referencing and automatic resource management across language boundaries. Furthermore, to address the blocking nature of Jupyter kernels and support recursive and asynchronous foreign calls, we introduce a novel side-channel communication mechanism.

Conventional keyword-based data augmentation methods often produce unrealistic sounds due to their reliance on manually defined labels, limiting scalability as machine types and anomaly patterns diversify. Advanced audio generative models, such as MIMII-Gen, show promise but typically depend on anomalous training data, making them less effective when diverse anomalous examples are unavailable. To address these limitations, we propose a novel synthesis approach leveraging large language models (LLMs) to interpret textual descriptions of faults and automatically select audio transformation functions, converting normal machine sounds into diverse and plausible anomalous sounds. We validate this approach by evaluating a UASD system trained only on normal sounds from five machine types, using both real and synthetic anomaly data. Experimental results reveal consistent trends in relative detection difficulty across machine types between synthetic and real anomalies. This finding supports our hypothesis and highlights the effectiveness of the proposed LLM-based synthesis approach for relative evaluation of UASD systems.</p></details> |  |

However, applying LLM agents to drug discovery is still constrained by challenges such as large-scale multimodal data processing, limited task automation, and poor support for domain-specific tools. To overcome these limitations, we introduce DrugPilot, a LLM-based agent system with a parameterized reasoning architecture designed for end-to-end scientific workflows in drug discovery. DrugPilot enables multi-stage research processes by integrating structured tool use with a novel parameterized memory pool. The memory pool converts heterogeneous data from both public sources and user-defined inputs into standardized representations. This design supports efficient multi-turn dialogue, reduces information loss during data exchange, and enhances complex scientific decision-making. To support training and benchmarking, we construct a drug instruction dataset covering eight core drug discovery tasks. Under the Berkeley function-calling benchmark, DrugPilot significantly outperforms state-of-the-art agents such as ReAct and LoT, achieving task completion rates of 98.0%, 93.5%, and 64.0% for simple, multi-tool, and multi-turn scenarios, respectively. These results highlight DrugPilot's potential as a versatile agent framework for computational science domains requiring automated, interactive, and data-integrated reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 8 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[MazeEval: A Benchmark for Testing Sequential Decision-Making in Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20395v1)** | 2025-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly power autonomous agents in robotics and embodied AI, understanding their spatial reasoning capabilities becomes crucial for ensuring reliable real-world deployment. Despite advances in language understanding, current research lacks evaluation of how LLMs perform spatial navigation without visual cues, a fundamental requirement for agents operating with limited sensory information. This paper addresses this gap by introducing MazeEval, a benchmark designed to isolate and evaluate pure spatial reasoning in LLMs through coordinate-based maze navigation tasks. Our methodology employs a function-calling interface where models navigate mazes of varying complexity ($5\times 5$ to $15\times 15$ grids) using only coordinate feedback and distance-to-wall information, excluding visual input to test fundamental spatial cognition. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art LLMs across identical mazes in both English and Icelandic to assess cross-linguistic transfer of spatial abilities. Our findings reveal striking disparities: while OpenAI's O3 achieves perfect navigation for mazes up to size $30\times 30$, other models exhibit catastrophic failure beyond $9\times 9$ mazes, with 100% of failures attributed to excessive looping behavior where models revisit a cell at least 10 times. We document a significant performance degradation in Icelandic, with models solving mazes 3-4 sizes smaller than in English, suggesting spatial reasoning in LLMs emerges from linguistic patterns rather than language-agnostic mechanisms. These results have important implications for global deployment of LLM-powered autonomous systems, showing spatial intelligence remains fundamentally constrained by training data availability and highlighting the need for architectural innovations to achieve reliable navigation across linguistic contexts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automated Synthesis of Formally Verified Multi-Abstraction Function Summaries](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09550v3)** | 2025-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Function summaries, which characterize the behavior of code segments (typically functions) through preconditions and postconditions, are essential for understanding, reusing, and verifying software, particularly in safety-critical domains like aerospace embedded systems. However, these mission-critical legacy code serving as a valuable reused asset often lacks formal specifications. It is challenging to automatically generate function summaries for C programs, due to the existence of complex features such as loops, nested function calls, pointer aliasing, and so on. Moreover, function summaries should support multiple abstraction levels to meet diverse requirements, e.g. precise summaries capturing full functionality for formal verification and intuitive summaries for human understanding. To address these challenges, we first propose a novel framework that combines symbolic execution, large language models (LLMs), and formal verification to generate Relatively Strongest Postconditions (RSPs) and build function summaries that fully capture program behavior. Our approach leverages VST-A's symbolic execution to precisely track program execution paths and state transitions, employs LLMs to infer loop invariants based on predefined templates, and uses Frama-C to guarantee soundness of generated summaries in an iterative refinement loop. Furthermore, from generated RSPs, we automatically synthesize strongest non-redundant postconditions expressed within given domain specific language. We compare our approach with existing work through extensive experiments.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we present ToolACE, an automatic agentic pipeline designed to generate accurate, complex, and diverse tool-learning data. ToolACE leverages a novel self-evolution synthesis process to curate a comprehensive API pool of 26,507 diverse APIs. Dialogs are further generated through the interplay among multiple agents, guided by a formalized thinking process. To ensure data accuracy, we implement a dual-layer verification system combining rule-based and model-based checks. We demonstrate that models trained on our synthesized data, even with only 8B parameters, achieve state-of-the-art performance on the Berkeley Function-Calling Leaderboard, rivaling the latest GPT-4 models. Our model and a subset of the data are publicly available at https://huggingface.co/Team-ACE.</p></details> | 21 pages, 22 figures |
| **[Sparse optimal control for infinite-dimensional linear systems with applications to graphon control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18030v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale networked systems typically operate under resource constraints, and it is also difficult to exactly obtain the network structure between nodes. To address these issues, this paper investigates a sparse optimal control for infinite-dimensional linear systems and its application to networked systems where the network structure is represented by a limit function called a graphon that captures the overall connection pattern. The contributions of this paper are twofold: (i) To reduce computational complexity, we derive a sufficient condition under which the sparse optimal control can be obtained by solving its corresponding L1 optimization problem. Furthermore, we introduce a class of non-convex optimal control problems such that the optimal solution always coincides with a sparse optimal control, provided that the non-convex problems admit optimal solutions. (ii) We show that the sparse optimal control for large-scale finite-dimensional networked systems can be approximated by that of the corresponding limit graphon system, provided that the underlying graph is close to the limit graphon in the cut-norm topology. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is illustrated through numerical examples.</p></details> | 16 pages |
| **[Static Analysis for Detecting Transaction Conflicts in Ethereum Smart Contracts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04357v2)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ethereum smart contracts operate in a concurrent environment where multiple transactions can be submitted simultaneously. However, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) enforces sequential execution of transactions within each block to prevent conflicts arising from concurrent access to the same state variables. Although this approach guarantees correct behavior, it limits the ability of validators to leverage multi-core architectures for faster transaction processing, thus restricting throughput. Existing solutions introduce concurrency by allowing simultaneous transaction execution combined with runtime conflict detection and rollback mechanisms to maintain correctness. However, these methods incur significant overhead due to continuous conflict tracking and transaction reversion. Recently, alternative approaches have emerged that aim to predict conflicts statically, before execution, by analyzing smart contract code for potential transaction interactions. Despite their promise, there is a lack of comprehensive studies that examine static conflict detection and its broader implications in specific smart contracts. This paper fills this important gap by proposing a novel static analysis method to detect potential transaction conflicts in Ethereum smart contracts. Our method identifies read-write, write-write, and function call conflicts between transaction pairs by analyzing state variable access patterns in Solidity contracts. We implement a tool that parses contract code and performs conflict detection. Evaluation on a dataset of real-world Ethereum smart contracts demonstrates that our approach achieves high precision in identifying potential conflicts. By enabling proactive conflict detection, our tool supports further design of transaction scheduling strategies that reduce runtime failures, enhance validator throughput, and contribute to blockchain scalability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Abstracting Extensible Recursive Functions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11742v2)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We explore recursive programming with extensible data types. Row types make the structure of data types first class, and can express a variety of type system features including record subtyping and combination of case branches. Our goal is the modular combination of recursive types and of recursive functions over them. The most significant challenge is in recursive function calls, which may need to account for new cases in a combined type. We introduce extensible histomorphisms, Mendler-style descriptions of recursive functions in which recursive calls can happen at larger types, and show that they provide expressive recursion over extensible data types. We formalize our approach in R$\omega\mu$, a row type theory with support for recursive terms and types.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mind the Gap: A Review of Arabic Post-Training Datasets and Their Limitations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14688v1)** | 2025-07-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Post-training has emerged as a crucial technique for aligning pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) with human instructions, significantly enhancing their performance across a wide range of tasks. Central to this process is the quality and diversity of post-training datasets. This paper presents a review of publicly available Arabic post-training datasets on the Hugging Face Hub, organized along four key dimensions: (1) LLM Capabilities (e.g., Question Answering, Translation, Reasoning, Summarization, Dialogue, Code Generation, and Function Calling); (2) Steerability (e.g., persona and system prompts); (3) Alignment (e.g., cultural, safety, ethics, and fairness), and (4) Robustness. Each dataset is rigorously evaluated based on popularity, practical adoption, recency and maintenance, documentation and annotation quality, licensing transparency, and scientific contribution. Our review revealed critical gaps in the development of Arabic post-training datasets, including limited task diversity, inconsistent or missing documentation and annotation, and low adoption across the community. Finally, the paper discusses the implications of these gaps on the progress of Arabic LLMs and applications while providing concrete recommendations for future efforts in post-training dataset development.</p></details> |  |
| **[A General Framework for Inference-time Scaling and Steering of Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06848v5)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models produce impressive results in modalities ranging from images and video to protein design and text. However, generating samples with user-specified properties remains a challenge. Recent research proposes fine-tuning models to maximize rewards that capture desired properties, but these methods require expensive training and are prone to mode collapse. In this work, we present Feynman-Kac (FK) steering, an inference-time framework for steering diffusion models with reward functions. FK steering works by sampling a system of multiple interacting diffusion processes, called particles, and resampling particles at intermediate steps based on scores computed using functions called potentials. Potentials are defined using rewards for intermediate states and are selected such that a high value indicates that the particle will yield a high-reward sample. We explore various choices of potentials, intermediate rewards, and samplers. We evaluate FK steering on text-to-image and text diffusion models. For steering text-to-image models with a human preference reward, we find that FK steering a 0.8B parameter model outperforms a 2.6B parameter fine-tuned model on prompt fidelity, with faster sampling and no training. For steering text diffusion models with rewards for text quality and specific text attributes, we find that FK steering generates lower perplexity, more linguistically acceptable outputs and enables gradient-free control of attributes like toxicity. Our results demonstrate that inference-time scaling and steering of diffusion models - even with off-the-shelf rewards - can provide significant sample quality gains and controllability benefits.

Although novel view synthesis approaches enhance rendering efficiency, they require additional learning effort for non-experts and lack support for semantic-level interaction. To bridge this gap, we propose NLI4VolVis, an interactive system that enables users to explore, query, and edit volumetric scenes using natural language. NLI4VolVis integrates multi-view semantic segmentation and vision-language models to extract and understand semantic components in a scene. We introduce a multi-agent large language model architecture equipped with extensive function-calling tools to interpret user intents and execute visualization tasks. The agents leverage external tools and declarative VolVis commands to interact with the VolVis engine powered by 3D editable Gaussians, enabling open-vocabulary object querying, real-time scene editing, best-view selection, and 2D stylization. We validate our system through case studies and a user study, highlighting its improved accessibility and usability in volumetric data exploration. We strongly recommend readers check our case studies, demo video, and source code at https://nli4volvis.github.io/.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE VIS 2025.

| **[Second-Order Bounds for [0,1]-Valued Regression via Betting Loss](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12584v1)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the $[0,1]$-valued regression problem in the i.i.d. setting. In a related problem called cost-sensitive classification, \citet{foster21efficient} have shown that the log loss minimizer achieves an improved generalization bound compared to that of the squared loss minimizer in the sense that the bound scales with the cost of the best classifier, which can be arbitrarily small depending on the problem at hand. Such a result is often called a first-order bound. For $[0,1]$-valued regression, we first show that the log loss minimizer leads to a similar first-order bound. We then ask if there exists a loss function that achieves a variance-dependent bound (also known as a second order bound), which is a strict improvement upon first-order bounds. We answer this question in the affirmative by proposing a novel loss function called the betting loss. Our result is ``variance-adaptive'' in the sense that the bound is attained \textit{without any knowledge about the variance}, which is in contrast to modeling label (or reward) variance or the label distribution itself explicitly as part of the function class such as distributional reinforcement learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scene-Aware Conversational ADAS with Generative AI for Real-Time Driver Assistance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10500v1)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While autonomous driving technologies continue to advance, current Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) remain limited in their ability to interpret scene context or engage with drivers through natural language. These systems typically rely on predefined logic and lack support for dialogue-based interaction, making them inflexible in dynamic environments or when adapting to driver intent. This paper presents Scene-Aware Conversational ADAS (SC-ADAS), a modular framework that integrates Generative AI components including large language models, vision-to-text interpretation, and structured function calling to enable real-time, interpretable, and adaptive driver assistance. SC-ADAS supports multi-turn dialogue grounded in visual and sensor context, allowing natural language recommendations and driver-confirmed ADAS control. Implemented in the CARLA simulator with cloud-based Generative AI, the system executes confirmed user intents as structured ADAS commands without requiring model fine-tuning. We evaluate SC-ADAS across scene-aware, conversational, and revisited multi-turn interactions, highlighting trade-offs such as increased latency from vision-based context retrieval and token growth from accumulated dialogue history. These results demonstrate the feasibility of combining conversational reasoning, scene perception, and modular ADAS control to support the next generation of intelligent driver assistance.</p></details> |  |

However, current tool integration approaches suffer from fragmentation, protocol limitations, and implementation complexity, leading to substantial development overhead. This paper presents Toolregistry, a protocol-agnostic tool management library that simplifies tool registration, representation, execution, and lifecycle management via a unified interface. Our evaluation demonstrates that \toolregistry achieves 60-80% reduction in tool integration code, up to 3.1x performance improvements through concurrent execution, and 100% compatibility with OpenAI function calling standards. Real-world case studies show significant improvements in development efficiency and code maintainability across diverse integration scenarios. \toolregistry is open-source and available at https://github.com/Oaklight/ToolRegistry, with comprehensive documentation at https://toolregistry.readthedocs.io/.</p></details> |  |
| **[Data-driven system identification using quadratic embeddings of nonlinear dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08202v2)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel data-driven method called QENDy (Quadratic Embedding of Nonlinear Dynamics) that not only allows us to learn quadratic representations of highly nonlinear dynamical systems, but also to identify the governing equations. The approach is based on an embedding of the system into a higher-dimensional feature space in which the dynamics become quadratic. Just like SINDy (Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics), our method requires trajectory data, time derivatives for the training data points, which can also be estimated using finite difference approximations, and a set of preselected basis functions, called dictionary. We illustrate the efficacy and accuracy of QENDy with the aid of various benchmark problems and compare its performance with SINDy and a deep learning method for identifying quadratic embeddings. Furthermore, we analyze the convergence of QENDy and SINDy in the infinite data limit, highlight their similarities and main differences, and compare the quadratic embedding with linearization techniques based on the Koopman operator.</p></details> |  |
| **[ODIA: Oriented Distillation for Inline Acceleration of LLM-based Function Calling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08877v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Function Calling is a crucial technique that enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to interact with external systems through APIs. However, the high latency associated with LLM-based Function Calling significantly impacts user experience. This paper presents a novel approach called Oriented Distillation for Inline Acceleration (ODIA) that leverages online user interaction data to accelerate Function Calling. By automatically identifying "simple queries" from production traffic and distilling knowledge from larger models to smaller ones, our method reduces response latency by 45% (expected) and 78% (median) while maintaining accuracy. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through real-world deployment in a music application, where the smaller model successfully handles 60% of traffic with negligible accuracy loss. Our method requires minimal human intervention and continuously improves through automated data collection and model updating, making it a practical solution for production environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning from Sparse Point Labels for Dense Carcinosis Localization in Advanced Ovarian Cancer Assessment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06643v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning from sparse labels is a challenge commonplace in the medical domain. This is due to numerous factors, such as annotation cost, and is especially true for newly introduced tasks. When dense pixel-level annotations are needed, this becomes even more unfeasible. However, being able to learn from just a few annotations at the pixel-level, while extremely difficult and underutilized, can drive progress in studies where perfect annotations are not immediately available. This work tackles the challenge of learning the dense prediction task of keypoint localization from a few point annotations in the context of 2d carcinosis keypoint localization from laparoscopic video frames for diagnostic planning of advanced ovarian cancer patients. To enable this, we formulate the problem as a sparse heatmap regression from a few point annotations per image and propose a new loss function, called Crag and Tail loss, for efficient learning. Our proposed loss function effectively leverages positive sparse labels while minimizing the impact of false negatives or missed annotations. Through an extensive ablation study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in achieving accurate dense localization of carcinosis keypoints, highlighting its potential to advance research in scenarios where dense annotations are challenging to obtain.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bridging AI and Software Security: A Comparative Vulnerability Assessment of LLM Agent Deployment Paradigms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06323v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM) agents face security vulnerabilities spanning AI-specific and traditional software domains, yet current research addresses these separately. This study bridges this gap through comparative evaluation of Function Calling architecture and Model Context Protocol (MCP) deployment paradigms using a unified threat classification framework. We tested 3,250 attack scenarios across seven language models, evaluating simple, composed, and chained attacks targeting both AI-specific threats (prompt injection) and software vulnerabilities (JSON injection, denial-of-service). Function Calling showed higher overall attack success rates (73.5% vs 62.59% for MCP), with greater system-centric vulnerability while MCP exhibited increased LLM-centric exposure. Attack complexity dramatically amplified effectiveness, with chained attacks achieving 91-96% success rates. Counterintuitively, advanced reasoning models demonstrated higher exploitability despite better threat detection. Results demonstrate that architectural choices fundamentally reshape threat landscapes. This work establishes methodological foundations for cross-domain LLM agent security assessment and provides evidence-based guidance for secure deployment.

| **[Combining Type Inference and Automated Unit Test Generation for Python](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01477v1)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated unit test generation is an established research field that has so far focused on statically-typed programming languages. The lack of type information in dynamically-typed programming languages, such as Python, inhibits test generators, which heavily rely on information about parameter and return types of functions to select suitable arguments when constructing test cases. Since automated test generators inherently rely on frequent execution of candidate tests, we make use of these frequent executions to address this problem by introducing type tracing, which extracts type-related information during execution and gradually refines the available type information. We implement type tracing as an extension of the Pynguin test-generation framework for Python, allowing it (i) to infer parameter types by observing how parameters are used during runtime, (ii) to record the types of values that function calls return, and (iii) to use this type information to increase code coverage. The approach leads to up to 90.0% more branch coverage, improved mutation scores, and to type information of similar quality to that produced by other state-of-the-art type-inference tools.</p></details> |  |

However, they overlook the complexity of real-world scenarios. To quantify how existing benchmarks address practical applications, we introduce DICE-SCORE, a metric that evaluates the dispersion of tool-related information such as function name and parameter values throughout the dialogue. Analyzing existing benchmarks through DICE-SCORE reveals notably low scores, highlighting the need for more realistic scenarios. To address this gap, we present DICE-BENCH, a framework that constructs practical function-calling datasets by synthesizing conversations through a tool graph that maintains dependencies across rounds and a multi-agent system with distinct personas to enhance dialogue naturalness. The final dataset comprises 1,607 high-DICE-SCORE instances. Our experiments on 19 LLMs with DICE-BENCH show that significant advances are still required before such models can be deployed effectively in real-world settings.

It aims to precisely filter the massive tools into a small set of candidates for the downstream tool-augmented LLMs. However, most existing approaches primarily focus on optimizing tool representations, often neglecting the importance of precise query comprehension. To address this gap, we introduce MassTool, a multi-task search-based framework designed to enhance both query representation and tool retrieval accuracy. MassTool employs a two-tower architecture: a tool usage detection tower that predicts the need for function calls, and a tool retrieval tower that leverages a query-centric graph convolution network (QC-GCN) for effective query-tool matching. It also incorporates search-based user intent modeling (SUIM) to handle diverse and out-of-distribution queries, alongside an adaptive knowledge transfer (AdaKT) module for efficient multi-task learning. By jointly optimizing tool usage detection loss, list-wise retrieval loss, and contrastive regularization loss, MassTool establishes a robust dual-step sequential decision-making pipeline for precise query understanding. Extensive experiments demonstrate its effectiveness in improving retrieval accuracy. Our code is available at https://github.com/wxydada/MassTool.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fuzzing: Randomness? Reasoning! Efficient Directed Fuzzing via Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22065v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fuzzing is highly effective in detecting bugs due to the key contribution of randomness. However, randomness significantly reduces the efficiency of fuzzing, causing it to cost days or weeks to expose bugs. Even though directed fuzzing reduces randomness by guiding fuzzing towards target buggy locations, the dilemma of randomness still challenges directed fuzzers. Two critical components, which are seeds and mutators, contain randomness and are closely tied to the conditions required for triggering bugs. Therefore, to address the challenge of randomness, we propose to use large language models (LLMs) to remove the randomness in seeds and reduce the randomness in mutators. With their strong reasoning and code generation capabilities, LLMs can be used to generate reachable seeds that target pre-determined locations and to construct bug-specific mutators tailored for specific bugs. We propose RandLuzz, which integrates LLMs and directed fuzzing, to improve the quality of seeds and mutators, resulting in efficient bug exposure. RandLuzz analyzes function call chain or functionality to guide LLMs in generating reachable seeds. To construct bug-specific mutators, RandLuzz uses LLMs to perform bug analysis, obtaining information such as bug causes and mutation suggestions, which further help generate code that performs bug-specific mutations. We evaluate RandLuzz by comparing it with four state-of-the-art directed fuzzers, AFLGo, Beacon, WindRanger, and SelectFuzz. With RandLuzz-generated seeds, the fuzzers achieve an average speedup ranging from 2.1$\times$ to 4.8$\times$ compared to using widely-used initial seeds. Additionally, when evaluated on individual bugs, RandLuzz achieves up to a 2.7$\times$ speedup compared to the second-fastest exposure. On 8 bugs, RandLuzz can even expose them within 60 seconds.</p></details> |  |
| **[Teaching a Language Model to Speak the Language of Tools](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23394v1)** | 2025-06-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>External tool integration through function-calling is essential for practical language model applications, yet most multilingual models lack reliable tool-use capabilities in non-English languages. Even state-of-the-art multilingual models struggle with determining when to use tools and generating the structured outputs required for function calls, often exhibiting language confusion when prompted in lower-resource languages. This work presents a methodology for adapting existing language models to enable robust tool use in any target language, using Bulgarian as a case study. The approach involves continued training of the BgGPT model series (2.6B, 9B, 27B parameters) on a novel bilingual dataset of 10,035 function-calling examples designed to support standardized protocols like MCP (Model Context Protocol). The research introduces TUCAN (Tool-Using Capable Assistant Navigator), which achieves up to 28.75% improvement in function-calling accuracy over base models while preserving core language understanding, as verified on established Bulgarian benchmarks. Beyond accuracy gains, TUCAN models demonstrate production-ready response formatting with clean, parsable function calls, contrasting with the verbose and inconsistent outputs of base models. The models, evaluation framework, and dataset are released to enable replication for other languages. This work demonstrates a practical approach for extending tool-augmented capabilities beyond English-centric systems.</p></details> |  |

Yet, the explosive proliferation of plugins, connectors, and inter-agent protocols has outpaced discovery mechanisms and security practices, resulting in brittle integrations vulnerable to diverse threats. In this survey, we introduce the first unified, end-to-end threat model for LLM-agent ecosystems, spanning host-to-tool and agent-to-agent communications, formalize adversary capabilities and attacker objectives, and catalog over thirty attack techniques. Specifically, we organized the threat model into four domains: Input Manipulation (e.g., prompt injections, long-context hijacks, multimodal adversarial inputs), Model Compromise (e.g., prompt- and parameter-level backdoors, composite and encrypted multi-backdoors, poisoning strategies), System and Privacy Attacks (e.g., speculative side-channels, membership inference, retrieval poisoning, social-engineering simulations), and Protocol Vulnerabilities (e.g., exploits in Model Context Protocol (MCP), Agent Communication Protocol (ACP), Agent Network Protocol (ANP), and Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol). For each category, we review representative scenarios, assess real-world feasibility, and evaluate existing defenses. Building on our threat taxonomy, we identify key open challenges and future research directions, such as securing MCP deployments through dynamic trust management and cryptographic provenance tracking; designing and hardening Agentic Web Interfaces; and achieving resilience in multi-agent and federated environments. Our work provides a comprehensive reference to guide the design of robust defense mechanisms and establish best practices for resilient LLM-agent workflows.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 15 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

Existing methods typically use rigid single-path execution, resulting in poor error recovery and exponentially growing search spaces. We introduce NaviAgent, a graph-navigated bilevel planning architecture for robust function calling, comprising a Multi-Path Decider and Graph-Encoded Navigator. As an LLM-powered agent, the Multi-Path Decider defines a four-dimensional decision space and continuously perceives environmental states, dynamically selecting the optimal action to fully cover all tool invocation scenarios. The Graph-Encoded Navigator constructs a Tool Dependency Heterogeneous Graph (TDHG), where node embeddings explicitly fuse API schema structure with historical invocation behavior. It also integrates a novel heuristic search strategy that guides the Decider toward efficient and highly successful toolchains, even for unseen tool combinations. Experiments show that NaviAgent consistently achieves the highest task success rate (TSR) across all foundation models and task complexities, outperforming the average baselines (ReAct, ToolLLM, {\alpha}-UMI) by 13.5%, 16.4%, and 19.0% on Qwen2.5-14B, Qwen2.5-32B, and Deepseek-V3, respectively. Its execution steps are typically within one step of the most efficient baseline, ensuring a strong balance between quality and efficiency. Notably, a fine-tuned Qwen2.5-14B model achieves a TSR of 49.5%, surpassing the much larger 32B model (44.9%) under our architecture. Incorporating the Graph-Encoded Navigator further boosts TSR by an average of 2.4 points, with gains up over 9 points on complex tasks for larger models (Deepseek-V3 and GPT-4o), highlighting its essential role in toolchain orchestration.</p></details> |  |

It enables the Ethereum blockchain to execute smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). The increasing adoption of Ethereum sparked the rise of phishing activities. Phishing attacks often target users through deceptive means, e.g., fake websites, wallet scams, or malicious smart contracts, aiming to steal sensitive information or funds. A timely detection of phishing activities in the EVM is therefore crucial to preserve the user trust and network integrity. Some state-of-the art approaches to phishing detection in smart contracts rely on the online analysis of transactions and their traces. However, replaying transactions often exposes sensitive user data and interactions, with several security concerns. In this work, we present PhishingHook, a framework that applies machine learning techniques to detect phishing activities in smart contracts by directly analyzing the contract's bytecode and its constituent opcodes. We evaluate the efficacy of such techniques in identifying malicious patterns, suspicious function calls, or anomalous behaviors within the contract's code itself before it is deployed or interacted with. We experimentally compare 16 techniques, belonging to four main categories (Histogram Similarity Classifiers, Vision Models, Language Models and Vulnerability Detection Models), using 7,000 real-world malware smart contracts. Our results demonstrate the efficiency of PhishingHook in performing phishing classification systems, with about 90% average accuracy among all the models. We support experimental reproducibility, and we release our code and datasets to the research community.</p></details> |  |

Investigating Binary Decomposition Under FCG Variance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19425v1)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Binary decomposition, which decomposes binary files into modules, plays a critical role in binary reuse detection. Existing binary decomposition works either apply anchor-based methods by extending anchor functions to generate modules, or apply clustering-based methods by using clustering algorithms to group binary functions, which all rely on that reused code shares similar function call relationships. However, we find that function call graphs (FCGs) vary a lot when using different compilation settings, especially with diverse function inlining decisions. In this work, we conduct the first systematic empirical study on the variance of FCGs compiled by various compilation settings and explore its effect on binary decomposition methods. We first construct a dataset compiled by 17 compilers, using 6 optimizations to 4 architectures and analyze the changes and mappings of the FCGs. We find that the size of FCGs changes dramatically, while the FCGs are still linked by three different kinds of mappings. Then we evaluate the existing works under the FCG variance, and results show that existing works are facing great challenges when conducting cross-compiler evaluation with diverse optimization settings. Finally, we propose a method to identify the optimal decomposition and compare the existing decomposition works with the optimal decomposition. Existing works either suffer from low coverage or cannot generate stable community similarities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Call Me Maybe: Enhancing JavaScript Call Graph Construction using Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18191v1)** | 2025-06-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Static analysis plays a key role in finding bugs, including security issues. A critical step in static analysis is building accurate call graphs that model function calls in a program. However, due to hard-to-analyze language features, existing call graph construction algorithms for JavaScript are neither sound nor complete. Prior work shows that even advanced solutions produce false edges and miss valid ones. In this work, we assist these tools by identifying missed call edges. Our main idea is to frame the problem as link prediction on full program graphs, using a rich representation with multiple edge types. Our approach, GRAPHIA, leverages recent advances in graph neural networks to model non-local relationships between code elements. Concretely, we propose representing JavaScript programs using a combination of syntactic- and semantic-based edges. GRAPHIA can learn from imperfect labels, including static call edges from existing tools and dynamic edges from tests, either from the same or different projects. Because call graphs are sparse, standard machine learning metrics like ROC are not suitable. Instead, we evaluate GRAPHIA by ranking function definitions for each unresolved call site. We conduct a large-scale evaluation on 50 popular JavaScript libraries with 163K call edges (150K static and 13K dynamic). GRAPHIA builds program graphs with 6.6M structural and 386K semantic edges. It ranks the correct target as the top candidate in over 42% of unresolved cases and within the top 5 in 72% of cases, reducing the manual effort needed for analysis. Our results show that learning-based methods can improve the recall of JavaScript call graph construction. To our knowledge, this is the first work to apply GNN-based link prediction to full multi-file program graphs for interprocedural analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[OWMM-Agent: Open World Mobile Manipulation With Multi-modal Agentic Data Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04217v2)** | 2025-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid progress of navigation, manipulation, and vision models has made mobile manipulators capable in many specialized tasks. However, the open-world mobile manipulation (OWMM) task remains a challenge due to the need for generalization to open-ended instructions and environments, as well as the systematic complexity to integrate high-level decision making with low-level robot control based on both global scene understanding and current agent state. To address this complexity, we propose a novel multi-modal agent architecture that maintains multi-view scene frames and agent states for decision-making and controls the robot by function calling. A second challenge is the hallucination from domain shift. To enhance the agent performance, we further introduce an agentic data synthesis pipeline for the OWMM task to adapt the VLM model to our task domain with instruction fine-tuning. We highlight our fine-tuned OWMM-VLM as the first dedicated foundation model for mobile manipulators with global scene understanding, robot state tracking, and multi-modal action generation in a unified model. Through experiments, we demonstrate that our model achieves SOTA performance compared to other foundation models including GPT-4o and strong zero-shot generalization in real world.

Rust ensures violations of such contract are impossible in regular safe code, but not in unsafe code where unsafe pinning APIs can be used. Library authors can encapsulate arbitrary unsafe code within regular library functions. These can be freely called in higher-level code without explicit warnings. Therefore, it is crucial to analyze library functions to rule out pinning API contract violations. Unfortunately, such testing relies on manual analysis by library authors, which is ineffective. Our goal is to develop a methodology that, given a library, attempts to construct programs that intentionally breach the pinning API contract by chaining library function calls, thereby verifying their soundness. We introduce RPIL, a novel intermediate representation that models functions' critical behaviors pertaining to pinning APIs. We implement PinChecker, a synthesis-driven violation detection tool guided by RPIL, which automatically synthesizes bug-revealing programs. Our experiments on 13 popular Rust libraries from crates.io found 2 confirmed bugs.</p></details> |  |

| **[GTR: Graph-Table-RAG for Cross-Table Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01346v3)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Beyond pure text, a substantial amount of knowledge is stored in tables. In real-world scenarios, user questions often require retrieving answers that are distributed across multiple tables. GraphRAG has recently attracted much attention for enhancing LLMs' reasoning capabilities by organizing external knowledge to address ad-hoc and complex questions, exemplifying a promising direction for cross-table question answering. In this paper, to address the current gap in available data, we first introduce a multi-table benchmark, MutliTableQA, comprising 60k tables and 25k user queries collected from real-world sources. Then, we propose the first Graph-Table-RAG framework, namely GTR, which reorganizes table corpora into a heterogeneous graph, employs a hierarchical coarse-to-fine retrieval process to extract the most relevant tables, and integrates graph-aware prompting for downstream LLMs' tabular reasoning. Extensive experiments show that GTR exhibits superior cross-table question-answering performance while maintaining high deployment efficiency, demonstrating its real-world practical applicability.</p></details> | 20 pages, 7 figures |

However, despite with intrinsic world knowledge, their application on structured tabular data prediction still lags behind, primarily due to the numerical insensitivity and modality discrepancy that brings a gap between LLM reasoning and statistical tabular learning. Unlike textual or vision data (e.g., electronic clinical notes or medical imaging data), tabular data is often presented in heterogeneous numerical values (e.g., CBC reports). This ubiquitous data format requires intensive expert annotation, and its numerical nature limits LLMs' capability to effectively transfer untapped domain expertise. In this paper, we propose SERSAL, a general self-prompting method by synergy learning with small models to enhance LLM tabular prediction in an unsupervised manner. Specifically, SERSAL utilizes the LLM's prior outcomes as original soft noisy annotations, which are dynamically leveraged to teach a better small student model. Reversely, the outcomes from the trained small model are used to teach the LLM to further refine its real capability. This process can be repeatedly applied to gradually distill refined knowledge for continuous progress. Comprehensive experiments on widely used medical domain tabular datasets show that, without access to gold labels, applying SERSAL to OpenAI GPT reasoning process attains substantial improvement compared to linguistic prompting methods, which serves as an orthogonal direction for tabular LLM, and increasing prompting bonus is observed as more powerful LLMs appear.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025.

| **[Elephants Never Forget: Memorization and Learning of Tabular Data in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06209v3)** | 2024-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While many have shown how Large Language Models (LLMs) can be applied to a diverse set of tasks, the critical issues of data contamination and memorization are often glossed over. In this work, we address this concern for tabular data. Specifically, we introduce a variety of different techniques to assess whether a language model has seen a tabular dataset during training. This investigation reveals that LLMs have memorized many popular tabular datasets verbatim. We then compare the few-shot learning performance of LLMs on datasets that were seen during training to the performance on datasets released after training. We find that LLMs perform better on datasets seen during training, indicating that memorization leads to overfitting. At the same time, LLMs show non-trivial performance on novel datasets and are surprisingly robust to data transformations. We then investigate the in-context statistical learning abilities of LLMs. While LLMs are significantly better than random at solving statistical classification problems, the sample efficiency of few-shot learning lags behind traditional statistical learning algorithms, especially as the dimension of the problem increases. This suggests that much of the observed few-shot performance on novel real-world datasets is due to the LLM's world knowledge. Overall, our results highlight the importance of testing whether an LLM has seen an evaluation dataset during pre-training. We release the https://github.com/interpretml/LLM-Tabular-Memorization-Checker Python package to test LLMs for memorization of tabular datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>COLM ...</summary><p>COLM camera ready, fix typo</p></details> |
| **[LLM Embeddings Improve Test-time Adaptation to Tabular $Y|X$-Shifts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07395v1)** | 2024-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For tabular datasets, the change in the relationship between the label and covariates ($Y|X$-shifts) is common due to missing variables (a.k.a. confounders). Since it is impossible to generalize to a completely new and unknown domain, we study models that are easy to adapt to the target domain even with few labeled examples. We focus on building more informative representations of tabular data that can mitigate $Y|X$-shifts, and propose to leverage the prior world knowledge in LLMs by serializing (write down) the tabular data to encode it. We find LLM embeddings alone provide inconsistent improvements in robustness, but models trained on them can be well adapted/finetuned to the target domain even using 32 labeled observations. Our finding is based on a comprehensive and systematic study consisting of 7650 source-target pairs and benchmark against 261,000 model configurations trained by 22 algorithms. Our observation holds when ablating the size of accessible target data and different adaptation strategies. The code is available at https://github.com/namkoong-lab/LLM-Tabular-Shifts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Elephants Never Forget: Testing Language Models for Memorization of Tabular Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06644v1)** | 2024-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While many have shown how Large Language Models (LLMs) can be applied to a diverse set of tasks, the critical issues of data contamination and memorization are often glossed over. In this work, we address this concern for tabular data. Starting with simple qualitative tests for whether an LLM knows the names and values of features, we introduce a variety of different techniques to assess the degrees of contamination, including statistical tests for conditional distribution modeling and four tests that identify memorization. Our investigation reveals that LLMs are pre-trained on many popular tabular datasets. This exposure can lead to invalid performance evaluation on downstream tasks because the LLMs have, in effect, been fit to the test set. Interestingly, we also identify a regime where the language model reproduces important statistics of the data, but fails to reproduce the dataset verbatim. On these datasets, although seen during training, good performance on downstream tasks might not be due to overfitting. Our findings underscore the need for ensuring data integrity in machine learning tasks with LLMs. To facilitate future research, we release an open-source tool that can perform various tests for memorization \url{https://github.com/interpretml/LLM-Tabular-Memorization-Checker}.</p></details> | <details><summary>Table...</summary><p>Table Representation Learning Workshop at NeurIPS 2023</p></details> |
