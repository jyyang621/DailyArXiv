| **[Leveraging LLMs for Utility-Focused Annotation: Reducing Manual Effort for Retrieval and RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05220v2)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval models typically rely on costly human-labeled query-document relevance annotations for training and evaluation. To reduce this cost and leverage the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in relevance judgments, we aim to explore whether LLM-generated annotations can effectively replace human annotations in training retrieval models. Retrieval usually emphasizes relevance, which indicates "topic-relatedness" of a document to a query, while in RAG, the value of a document (or utility) depends on how it contributes to answer generation. Recognizing this mismatch, some researchers use LLM performance on downstream tasks with documents as labels, but this approach requires manual answers for specific tasks, leading to high costs and limited generalization. In another line of work, prompting LLMs to select useful documents as RAG references eliminates the need for human annotation and is not task-specific. If we leverage LLMs' utility judgments to annotate retrieval data, we may retain cross-task generalization without human annotation in large-scale corpora. Therefore, we investigate utility-focused annotation via LLMs for large-scale retriever training data across both in-domain and out-of-domain settings on the retrieval and RAG tasks. To reduce the impact of low-quality positives labeled by LLMs, we design a novel loss function, i.e., Disj-InfoNCE. Our experiments reveal that: (1) Retrievers trained on utility-focused annotations significantly outperform those trained on human annotations in the out-of-domain setting on both tasks, demonstrating superior generalization capabilities. (2) LLM annotation does not replace human annotation in the in-domain setting. However, incorporating just 20% human-annotated data enables retrievers trained with utility-focused annotations to match the performance of models trained entirely with human annotations.</p></details> | 12 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Diversity Enhances an LLM's Performance in RAG and Long-context Task](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09017v2)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have highlighted the challenge of context window limitations, primarily due to the quadratic time complexity of the self-attention mechanism (\(O(N^2)\), where \(N\) denotes the context window length). This constraint impacts tasks such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) in question answering (Q\&A) and long context summarization. A common approach involves selecting content with the highest similarity to the query; however, this often leads to redundancy and the exclusion of diverse yet relevant information. Building on principles from Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) and Farthest Point Sampling (FPS), we integrate diversity into the content selection process. Our findings reveal that incorporating diversity substantially increases the recall of selecting relevant sentences or chunks before LLM-based Q\&A and summarization. These results highlight the importance of maintaining diversity in future LLM applications to further improve summarization and Q\&A outcomes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Real-Time Evaluation Models for RAG: Who Detects Hallucinations Best?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21157v3)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This article surveys Evaluation models to automatically detect hallucinations in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and presents a comprehensive benchmark of their performance across six RAG applications. Methods included in our study include: LLM-as-a-Judge, Prometheus, Lynx, the Hughes Hallucination Evaluation Model (HHEM), and the Trustworthy Language Model (TLM). These approaches are all reference-free, requiring no ground-truth answers/labels to catch incorrect LLM responses. Our study reveals that, across diverse RAG applications, some of these approaches consistently detect incorrect RAG responses with high precision/recall.</p></details> | 11 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Hierarchical Planning for Complex Tasks with Knowledge Graph-RAG and Symbolic Verification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04578v1)** | 2025-04-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise as robotic planners but often struggle with long-horizon and complex tasks, especially in specialized environments requiring external knowledge. While hierarchical planning and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) address some of these challenges, they remain insufficient on their own and a deeper integration is required for achieving more reliable systems. To this end, we propose a neuro-symbolic approach that enhances LLMs-based planners with Knowledge Graph-based RAG for hierarchical plan generation. This method decomposes complex tasks into manageable subtasks, further expanded into executable atomic action sequences. To ensure formal correctness and proper decomposition, we integrate a Symbolic Validator, which also functions as a failure detector by aligning expected and observed world states. Our evaluation against baseline methods demonstrates the consistent significant advantages of integrating hierarchical planning, symbolic verification, and RAG across tasks of varying complexity and different LLMs. Additionally, our experimental setup and novel metrics not only validate our approach for complex planning but also serve as a tool for assessing LLMs' reasoning and compositional capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Driving-RAG: Driving Scenarios Embedding, Search, and RAG Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04419v1)** | 2025-04-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Driving scenario data play an increasingly vital role in the development of intelligent vehicles and autonomous driving. Accurate and efficient scenario data search is critical for both online vehicle decision-making and planning, and offline scenario generation and simulations, as it allows for leveraging the scenario experiences to improve the overall performance. Especially with the application of large language models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented-Generation (RAG) systems in autonomous driving, urgent requirements are put forward. In this paper, we introduce the Driving-RAG framework to address the challenges of efficient scenario data embedding, search, and applications for RAG systems. Our embedding model aligns fundamental scenario information and scenario distance metrics in the vector space. The typical scenario sampling method combined with hierarchical navigable small world can perform efficient scenario vector search to achieve high efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. In addition, the reorganization mechanism by graph knowledge enhances the relevance to the prompt scenarios and augment LLM generation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework on typical trajectory planning task for complex interactive scenarios such as ramps and intersections, showcasing its advantages for RAG applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Code Generation to Software Testing: AI Copilot with Context-Based RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01866v2)** | 2025-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid pace of large-scale software development places increasing demands on traditional testing methodologies, often leading to bottlenecks in efficiency, accuracy, and coverage. We propose a novel perspective on software testing by positing bug detection and coding with fewer bugs as two interconnected problems that share a common goal, which is reducing bugs with limited resources. We extend our previous work on AI-assisted programming, which supports code auto-completion and chatbot-powered Q&A, to the realm of software testing. We introduce Copilot for Testing, an automated testing system that synchronizes bug detection with codebase updates, leveraging context-based Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to enhance the capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Our evaluation demonstrates a 31.2% improvement in bug detection accuracy, a 12.6% increase in critical test coverage, and a 10.5% higher user acceptance rate, highlighting the transformative potential of AI-driven technologies in modern software development practices.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted for publication in IEEE Software (DOI: 10.1109/MS.2025.3549628)</p></details> |
| **[Retrieving Semantics from the Deep: an RAG Solution for Gesture Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06786v3)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Non-verbal communication often comprises of semantically rich gestures that help convey the meaning of an utterance. Producing such semantic co-speech gestures has been a major challenge for the existing neural systems that can generate rhythmic beat gestures, but struggle to produce semantically meaningful gestures. Therefore, we present RAG-Gesture, a diffusion-based gesture generation approach that leverages Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to produce natural-looking and semantically rich gestures. Our neuro-explicit gesture generation approach is designed to produce semantic gestures grounded in interpretable linguistic knowledge. We achieve this by using explicit domain knowledge to retrieve exemplar motions from a database of co-speech gestures. Once retrieved, we then inject these semantic exemplar gestures into our diffusion-based gesture generation pipeline using DDIM inversion and retrieval guidance at the inference time without any need of training. Further, we propose a control paradigm for guidance, that allows the users to modulate the amount of influence each retrieval insertion has over the generated sequence. Our comparative evaluations demonstrate the validity of our approach against recent gesture generation approaches. The reader is urged to explore the results on our project page.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025.

| **[CacheBlend: Fast Large Language Model Serving for RAG with Cached Knowledge Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16444v3)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) often incorporate multiple text chunks in their inputs to provide the necessary contexts. To speed up the prefill of the long LLM inputs, one can pre-compute the KV cache of a text and re-use the KV cache when the context is reused as the prefix of another LLM input. However, the reused text chunks are not always the input prefix, which makes precomputed KV caches not directly usable since they ignore the text's cross-attention with the preceding texts. Thus, the benefits of reusing KV caches remain largely unrealized. This paper tackles just one challenge: when an LLM input contains multiple text chunks, how to quickly combine their precomputed KV caches in order to achieve the same generation quality as the expensive full prefill (i.e., without reusing KV cache)? This challenge naturally arises in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) where the input is supplemented with multiple retrieved texts as the context. We present CacheBlend, a scheme that reuses the precomputed KV caches, regardless prefix or not, and selectively recomputes the KV values of a small subset of tokens to partially update each reused KV cache. In the meantime, the small extra delay for recomputing some tokens can be pipelined with the retrieval of KV caches within the same job, allowing CacheBlend to store KV caches in slower devices with more storage capacity while retrieving them without increasing the inference delay. By comparing CacheBlend with the state-of-the-art KV cache reusing schemes on three open-source LLMs of various sizes and four popular benchmark datasets of different tasks, we show that CacheBlend reduces time-to-first-token (TTFT) by 2.2-3.3x and increases the inference throughput by 2.8-5x from full KV recompute without compromising generation quality. The code is available at https://github.com/LMCache/LMCache.</p></details> |  |
| **[GTR: Graph-Table-RAG for Cross-Table Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01346v2)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Beyond pure text, a substantial amount of knowledge is stored in tables. In real-world scenarios, user questions often require retrieving answers that are distributed across multiple tables. GraphRAG has recently attracted much attention for enhancing LLMs' reasoning capabilities by organizing external knowledge to address ad-hoc and complex questions, exemplifying a promising direction for cross-table question answering. In this paper, to address the current gap in available data, we first introduce a multi-table benchmark, MutliTableQA, comprising 60k tables and 25k user queries collected from real-world sources. Then, we propose the first Graph-Table-RAG framework, namely GTR, which reorganizes table corpora into a heterogeneous graph, employs a hierarchical coarse-to-fine retrieval process to extract the most relevant tables, and integrates graph-aware prompting for downstream LLMs' tabular reasoning. Extensive experiments show that GTR exhibits superior cross-table question-answering performance while maintaining high deployment efficiency, demonstrating its real-world practical applicability.</p></details> | 20 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Beyond Quacking: Deep Integration of Language Models and RAG into DuckDB](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01157v1)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge-intensive analytical applications retrieve context from both structured tabular data and unstructured, text-free documents for effective decision-making. Large language models (LLMs) have made it significantly easier to prototype such retrieval and reasoning data pipelines. However, implementing these pipelines efficiently still demands significant effort and has several challenges. This often involves orchestrating heterogeneous data systems, managing data movement, and handling low-level implementation details, e.g., LLM context management. To address these challenges, we introduce FlockMTL: an extension for DBMSs that deeply integrates LLM capabilities and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). FlockMTL includes model-driven scalar and aggregate functions, enabling chained predictions through tuple-level mappings and reductions. Drawing inspiration from the relational model, FlockMTL incorporates: (i) cost-based optimizations, which seamlessly apply techniques such as batching and caching; and (ii) resource independence, enabled through novel SQL DDL abstractions: PROMPT and MODEL, introduced as first-class schema objects alongside TABLE. FlockMTL streamlines the development of knowledge-intensive analytical applications, and its optimizations ease the implementation burden.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-Routing RAG: Binding Selective Retrieval with Knowledge Verbalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01018v1)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Selective retrieval improves retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) by reducing distractions from low-quality retrievals and improving efficiency. However, existing approaches under-utilize the inherent knowledge of large language models (LLMs), leading to suboptimal retrieval decisions and degraded generation performance. To bridge this gap, we propose Self-Routing RAG (SR-RAG), a novel framework that binds selective retrieval with knowledge verbalization. SR-RAG enables an LLM to dynamically decide between external retrieval and verbalizing its own parametric knowledge. To this end, we design a multi-task objective that jointly optimizes an LLM on knowledge source selection, knowledge verbalization, and response generation. We further introduce dynamic knowledge source inference via nearest neighbor search to improve the accuracy of knowledge source decision under domain shifts. Fine-tuning three LLMs with SR-RAG significantly improves both their response accuracy and inference latency. Compared to the strongest selective retrieval baseline, SR-RAG reduces retrievals by 29% while improving the performance by 5.1%.</p></details> | Work in Progress |
| **[TOBUGraph: Knowledge Graph-Based Retrieval for Enhanced LLM Performance Beyond RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05447v2)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is one of the leading and most widely used techniques for enhancing LLM retrieval capabilities, but it still faces significant limitations in commercial use cases. RAG primarily relies on the query-chunk text-to-text similarity in the embedding space for retrieval and can fail to capture deeper semantic relationships across chunks, is highly sensitive to chunking strategies, and is prone to hallucinations. To address these challenges, we propose TOBUGraph, a graph-based retrieval framework that first constructs the knowledge graph from unstructured data dynamically and automatically. Using LLMs, TOBUGraph extracts structured knowledge and diverse relationships among data, going beyond RAG's text-to-text similarity. Retrieval is achieved through graph traversal, leveraging the extracted relationships and structures to enhance retrieval accuracy, eliminating the need for chunking configurations while reducing hallucination. We demonstrate TOBUGraph's effectiveness in TOBU, a real-world application in production for personal memory organization and retrieval. Our evaluation using real user data demonstrates that TOBUGraph outperforms multiple RAG implementations in both precision and recall, significantly improving user experience through improved retrieval accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Contradiction Detection in RAG Systems: Evaluating LLMs as Context Validators for Improved Information Consistency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00180v1)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have emerged as a powerful method for enhancing large language models (LLMs) with up-to-date information. However, the retrieval step in RAG can sometimes surface documents containing contradictory information, particularly in rapidly evolving domains such as news. These contradictions can significantly impact the performance of LLMs, leading to inconsistent or erroneous outputs. This study addresses this critical challenge in two ways. First, we present a novel data generation framework to simulate different types of contradictions that may occur in the retrieval stage of a RAG system. Second, we evaluate the robustness of different LLMs in performing as context validators, assessing their ability to detect contradictory information within retrieved document sets. Our experimental results reveal that context validation remains a challenging task even for state-of-the-art LLMs, with performance varying significantly across different types of contradictions. While larger models generally perform better at contradiction detection, the effectiveness of different prompting strategies varies across tasks and model architectures. We find that chain-of-thought prompting shows notable improvements for some models but may hinder performance in others, highlighting the complexity of the task and the need for more robust approaches to context validation in RAG systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Systematic Evaluation of LLM Strategies for Mental Health Text Analysis: Fine-tuning vs. Prompt Engineering vs. RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24307v1)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study presents a systematic comparison of three approaches for the analysis of mental health text using large language models (LLMs): prompt engineering, retrieval augmented generation (RAG), and fine-tuning. Using LLaMA 3, we evaluate these approaches on emotion classification and mental health condition detection tasks across two datasets. Fine-tuning achieves the highest accuracy (91% for emotion classification, 80% for mental health conditions) but requires substantial computational resources and large training sets, while prompt engineering and RAG offer more flexible deployment with moderate performance (40-68% accuracy). Our findings provide practical insights for implementing LLM-based solutions in mental health applications, highlighting the trade-offs between accuracy, computational requirements, and deployment flexibility.</p></details> |  |
| **[A RAG-Based Multi-Agent LLM System for Natural Hazard Resilience and Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07877v3)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are a transformational capability at the frontier of artificial intelligence and machine learning that can support decision-makers in addressing pressing societal challenges such as extreme natural hazard events. As generalized models, LLMs often struggle to provide context-specific information, particularly in areas requiring specialized knowledge. In this work, we propose a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based multi-agent LLM system to support analysis and decision-making in the context of natural hazards and extreme weather events. As a proof of concept, we present WildfireGPT, a specialized system focused on wildfire scenarios. The architecture employs a user-centered, multi-agent design to deliver tailored risk insights across diverse stakeholder groups. By integrating domain-specific projection data, observational datasets, and scientific literature through a RAG framework, the system ensures both accuracy and contextual relevance of the information it provides. Evaluation across ten expert-led case studies demonstrates that WildfireGPT significantly outperforms existing LLM-based solutions for decision support in natural hazard and extreme weather contexts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Systematic Knowledge Injection into Large Language Models via Diverse Augmentation for Domain-Specific RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08356v3)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a prominent method for incorporating domain knowledge into Large Language Models (LLMs). While RAG enhances response relevance by incorporating retrieved domain knowledge in the context, retrieval errors can still lead to hallucinations and incorrect answers. To recover from retriever failures, domain knowledge is injected by fine-tuning the model to generate the correct response, even in the case of retrieval errors. However, we observe that without systematic knowledge augmentation, fine-tuned LLMs may memorize new information but still fail to extract relevant domain knowledge, leading to poor performance. In this work, we present a novel framework that significantly enhances the fine-tuning process by augmenting the training data in two ways -- context augmentation and knowledge paraphrasing. In context augmentation, we create multiple training samples for a given QA pair by varying the relevance of the retrieved information, teaching the model when to ignore and when to rely on retrieved content. In knowledge paraphrasing, we fine-tune with multiple answers to the same question, enabling LLMs to better internalize specialized knowledge. To mitigate catastrophic forgetting due to fine-tuning, we add a domain-specific identifier to a question and also utilize a replay buffer containing general QA pairs. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our method over existing techniques, achieving up to 10\% relative gain in token-level recall while preserving the LLM's generalization capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 14 tables, to be published in NAACL 2025</p></details> |
| **[Does RAG Introduce Unfairness in LLMs? Evaluating Fairness in Retrieval-Augmented Generation Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19804v2)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has recently gained significant attention for its enhanced ability to integrate external knowledge sources into open-domain question answering (QA) tasks. However, it remains unclear how these models address fairness concerns, particularly with respect to sensitive attributes such as gender, geographic location, and other demographic factors. First, as language models evolve to prioritize utility, like improving exact match accuracy, fairness considerations may have been largely overlooked. Second, the complex, multi-component architecture of RAG methods poses challenges in identifying and mitigating biases, as each component is optimized for distinct objectives. In this paper, we aim to empirically evaluate fairness in several RAG methods. We propose a fairness evaluation framework tailored to RAG, using scenario-based questions and analyzing disparities across demographic attributes. Our experimental results indicate that, despite recent advances in utility-driven optimization, fairness issues persist in both the retrieval and generation stages. These findings underscore the need for targeted interventions to address fairness concerns throughout the RAG pipeline. The dataset and code used in this study are publicly available at this GitHub Repository https://github.com/elviswxy/RAG_fairness .</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at COLING 2025</p></details> |
| **[Balancing Content Size in RAG-Text2SQL System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15723v3)** | 2025-03-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising solution for converting natural language queries into SQL commands, enabling seamless database interaction. However, these Text-to-SQL (Text2SQL) systems face inherent limitations, hallucinations, outdated knowledge, and untraceable reasoning. To address these challenges, the integration of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with Text2SQL models has gained traction. RAG serves as a retrieval mechanism, providing essential contextual information, such as table schemas and metadata, to enhance the query generation process. Despite their potential, RAG + Text2SQL systems are susceptible to the quality and size of retrieved documents. While richer document content can improve schema relevance and retrieval accuracy, it also introduces noise, increasing the risk of hallucinations and reducing query fidelity as the prompt size of the Text2SQL model increases. This research investigates the nuanced trade-off between document size and quality, aiming to strike a balance that optimizes system performance. Key thresholds are identified where performance degradation occurs, along with actionable strategies to mitigate these challenges. Additionally, we explore the phenomenon of hallucinations in Text2SQL models, emphasizing the critical role of curated document presentation in minimizing errors. Our findings provide a roadmap for enhancing the robustness of RAG + Text2SQL systems, offering practical insights for real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tuning LLMs by RAG Principles: Towards LLM-native Memory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16071v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Memory, additional information beyond the training of large language models (LLMs), is crucial to various real-world applications, such as personal assistant. The two mainstream solutions to incorporate memory into the generation process are long-context LLMs and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). In this paper, we first systematically compare these two types of solutions on three renovated/new datasets and show that (1) long-context solutions, although more expensive, shall be easier to capture the big picture and better answer queries which require considering the memory as a whole; and (2) when the queries concern specific information, RAG solutions shall be more competitive especially when the keywords can be explicitly matched. Therefore, we propose a novel method RAG-Tuned-LLM which fine-tunes a relative small (e.g., 7B) LLM using the data generated following the RAG principles, so it can combine the advantages of both solutions. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate that RAG-Tuned-LLM can beat long-context LLMs and RAG methods across a wide range of query types.</p></details> |  |

This section serves as a valuable resource for early-career researchers seeking unexplored areas and experienced researchers looking for new projects or collaborations. In this study, we generate future work suggestions from key sections of a scientific article alongside related papers and analyze how the trends have evolved. We experimented with various Large Language Models (LLMs) and integrated Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to enhance the generation process. We incorporate a LLM feedback mechanism to improve the quality of the generated content and propose an LLM-as-a-judge approach for evaluation. Our results demonstrated that the RAG-based approach with LLM feedback outperforms other methods evaluated through qualitative and quantitative metrics. Moreover, we conduct a human evaluation to assess the LLM as an extractor and judge. The code and dataset for this project are here, code: HuggingFace</p></details> | 19 pages, 5 figures |

The recent purposed Mixed-Precision Over-the-Air Federated Learning (MP-OTA-FL) enables clients to operate at appropriate precision levels based on their heterogeneous hardware, taking advantages of the larger trade-off space while covering the quantization overheads in the mixed-precision modulation scheme for the OTA aggregation process. A key to further exploring the potential of the MP-OTA-FL framework is the optimization of client precision levels. The choice of precision level hinges on multifaceted factors including hardware capability, potential client contribution, and user satisfaction, among which factors can be difficult to define or quantify. In this paper, we propose a RAG-based User Profiling for precision planning framework that integrates retrieval-augmented LLMs and dynamic client profiling to optimize satisfaction and contributions. This includes a hybrid interface for gathering device/user insights and an RAG database storing historical quantization decisions with feedback. Experiments show that our method boosts satisfaction, energy savings, and global model accuracy in MP-OTA-FL systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables, submitted to IEEE VTC 2025 fall for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[A RAG-based Question Answering System Proposal for Understanding Islam: MufassirQAS LLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15378v5)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Challenges exist in learning and understanding religions, such as the complexity and depth of religious doctrines and teachings. Chatbots as question-answering systems can help in solving these challenges. LLM chatbots use NLP techniques to establish connections between topics and accurately respond to complex questions. These capabilities make it perfect for enlightenment on religion as a question-answering chatbot. However, LLMs also tend to generate false information, known as hallucination. Also, the chatbots' responses can include content that insults personal religious beliefs, interfaith conflicts, and controversial or sensitive topics. It must avoid such cases without promoting hate speech or offending certain groups of people or their beliefs. This study uses a vector database-based Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approach to enhance the accuracy and transparency of LLMs. Our question-answering system is called "MufassirQAS". We created a database consisting of several open-access books that include Turkish context. These books contain Turkish translations and interpretations of Islam. This database is utilized to answer religion-related questions and ensure our answers are trustworthy. The relevant part of the dataset, which LLM also uses, is presented along with the answer. We have put careful effort into creating system prompts that give instructions to prevent harmful, offensive, or disrespectful responses to respect people's values and provide reliable results. The system answers and shares additional information, such as the page number from the respective book and the articles referenced for obtaining the information. MufassirQAS and ChatGPT are also tested with sensitive questions. We got better performance with our system. Study and enhancements are still in progress. Results and future works are given.</p></details> |  |
| **[SOSecure: Safer Code Generation with RAG and StackOverflow Discussions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13654v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used for automated code generation. Their reliance on infrequently updated pretraining data leaves them unaware of newly discovered vulnerabilities and evolving security standards, making them prone to producing insecure code. In contrast, developer communities on Stack Overflow (SO) provide an ever-evolving repository of knowledge, where security vulnerabilities are actively discussed and addressed through collective expertise. These community-driven insights remain largely untapped by LLMs. This paper introduces SOSecure, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that leverages the collective security expertise found in SO discussions to improve the security of LLM-generated code. We build a security-focused knowledge base by extracting SO answers and comments that explicitly identify vulnerabilities. Unlike common uses of RAG, SOSecure triggers after code has been generated to find discussions that identify flaws in similar code. These are used in a prompt to an LLM to consider revising the code. Evaluation across three datasets (SALLM, LLMSecEval, and LMSys) show that SOSecure achieves strong fix rates of 71.7%, 91.3%, and 96.7% respectively, compared to prompting GPT-4 without relevant discussions (49.1%, 56.5%, and 37.5%), and outperforms multiple other baselines. SOSecure operates as a language-agnostic complement to existing LLMs, without requiring retraining or fine-tuning, making it easy to deploy. Our results underscore the importance of maintaining active developer forums, which have dropped substantially in usage with LLM adoptions.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we proposed MES-RAG framework, which enhances entity-specific query handling and provides accurate, secure, and consistent responses. MES-RAG introduces proactive security measures that ensure system integrity by applying protections prior to data access. Additionally, the system supports real-time multi-modal outputs, including text, images, audio, and video, seamlessly integrating into existing RAG architectures. Experimental results demonstrate that MES-RAG significantly improves both accuracy and recall, highlighting its effectiveness in advancing the security and utility of question-answering, increasing accuracy to 0.83 (+0.25) on targeted task.

| **[Privacy-Aware RAG: Secure and Isolated Knowledge Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15548v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread adoption of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems in real-world applications has heightened concerns about the confidentiality and integrity of their proprietary knowledge bases. These knowledge bases, which play a critical role in enhancing the generative capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), are increasingly vulnerable to breaches that could compromise sensitive information. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an advanced encryption methodology designed to protect RAG systems from unauthorized access and data leakage. Our approach encrypts both textual content and its corresponding embeddings prior to storage, ensuring that all data remains securely encrypted. This mechanism restricts access to authorized entities with the appropriate decryption keys, thereby significantly reducing the risk of unintended data exposure. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our encryption strategy preserves the performance and functionality of RAG pipelines, ensuring compatibility across diverse domains and applications. To validate the robustness of our method, we provide comprehensive security proofs that highlight its resilience against potential threats and vulnerabilities. These proofs also reveal limitations in existing approaches, which often lack robustness, adaptability, or reliance on open-source models. Our findings suggest that integrating advanced encryption techniques into the design and deployment of RAG systems can effectively enhance privacy safeguards. This research contributes to the ongoing discourse on improving security measures for AI-driven services and advocates for stricter data protection standards within RAG architectures.</p></details> |  |
| **[RAG-KG-IL: A Multi-Agent Hybrid Framework for Reducing Hallucinations and Enhancing LLM Reasoning through RAG and Incremental Knowledge Graph Learning Integration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13514v1)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents RAG-KG-IL, a novel multi-agent hybrid framework designed to enhance the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Knowledge Graphs (KGs) with an Incremental Learning (IL) approach. Despite recent advancements, LLMs still face significant challenges in reasoning with structured data, handling dynamic knowledge evolution, and mitigating hallucinations, particularly in mission-critical domains. Our proposed RAG-KG-IL framework addresses these limitations by employing a multi-agent architecture that enables continuous knowledge updates, integrates structured knowledge, and incorporates autonomous agents for enhanced explainability and reasoning. The framework utilizes RAG to ensure the generated responses are grounded in verifiable information, while KGs provide structured domain knowledge for improved consistency and depth of understanding. The Incremental Learning approach allows for dynamic updates to the knowledge base without full retraining, significantly reducing computational overhead and improving the model's adaptability. We evaluate the framework using real-world case studies involving health-related queries, comparing it to state-of-the-art models like GPT-4o and a RAG-only baseline. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces hallucination rates and improves answer completeness and reasoning accuracy. The results underscore the potential of combining RAG, KGs, and multi-agent systems to create intelligent, adaptable systems capable of real-time knowledge integration and reasoning in complex domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Taxonomic Reasoning for Rare Arthropods: Combining Dense Image Captioning and RAG for Interpretable Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10886v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the context of pressing climate change challenges and the significant biodiversity loss among arthropods, automated taxonomic classification from organismal images is a subject of intense research. However, traditional AI pipelines based on deep neural visual architectures such as CNNs or ViTs face limitations such as degraded performance on the long-tail of classes and the inability to reason about their predictions. We integrate image captioning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with large language models (LLMs) to enhance biodiversity monitoring, showing particular promise for characterizing rare and unknown arthropod species. While a naive Vision-Language Model (VLM) excels in classifying images of common species, the RAG model enables classification of rarer taxa by matching explicit textual descriptions of taxonomic features to contextual biodiversity text data from external sources. The RAG model shows promise in reducing overconfidence and enhancing accuracy relative to naive LLMs, suggesting its viability in capturing the nuances of taxonomic hierarchy, particularly at the challenging family and genus levels. Our findings highlight the potential for modern vision-language AI pipelines to support biodiversity conservation initiatives, emphasizing the role of comprehensive data curation and collaboration with citizen science platforms to improve species identification, unknown species characterization and ultimately inform conservation strategies.</p></details> | 12 pages, 3 figures |

This paper introduces ClaimTrust, a propagation-based trust scoring framework that dynamically evaluates the reliability of documents in a RAG system. Using a modified PageRank-inspired algorithm, ClaimTrust propagates trust scores across documents based on relationships derived from extracted factual claims. We preprocess and analyze 814 political news articles from Kaggle's Fake News Detection Dataset to extract 2,173 unique claims and classify 965 meaningful relationships (supporting or contradicting). By representing the dataset as a document graph, ClaimTrust iteratively updates trust scores until convergence, effectively differentiating trustworthy articles from unreliable ones. Our methodology, which leverages embedding-based filtering for efficient claim comparison and relationship classification, achieves a 11.2% of significant connections while maintaining computational scalability. Experimental results demonstrate that ClaimTrust successfully assigns higher trust scores to verified documents while penalizing those containing false information. Future directions include fine-tuned claim extract and compare (Li et al., 2022), parameter optimization, enhanced language model utilization, and robust evaluation metrics to generalize the framework across diverse datasets and domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 2 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

To effectively assess their video comprehension capabilities, long video understanding benchmarks, such as Video-MME and MLVU, are proposed. However, these benchmarks directly use uniform frame sampling for testing, which results in significant information loss and affects the accuracy of the evaluations in reflecting the true abilities of MLLMs. To address this, we propose RAG-Adapter, a plug-and-play framework that reduces information loss during testing by sampling frames most relevant to the given question. Additionally, we introduce a Grouped-supervised Contrastive Learning (GCL) method to further enhance sampling effectiveness of RAG-Adapter through fine-tuning on our constructed MMAT dataset. Finally, we test numerous baseline MLLMs on various video understanding benchmarks, finding that RAG-Adapter sampling consistently outperforms uniform sampling (e.g., Accuracy of GPT-4o increases by 9.3 percent on Video-MME), providing a more accurate testing method for long video benchmarks.</p></details> | 37 pages, 36 figures |

Predictive maintenance (PdM) in such settings demands methodologies that are adaptive, transferable, and capable of integrating domain-specific knowledge. In this paper, we present RAAD-LLM, a novel framework for adaptive anomaly detection, leveraging large language models (LLMs) integrated with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). This approach addresses the aforementioned PdM challenges. By effectively utilizing domain-specific knowledge, RAAD-LLM enhances the detection of anomalies in time series data without requiring fine-tuning on specific datasets. The framework's adaptability mechanism enables it to adjust its understanding of normal operating conditions dynamically, thus increasing detection accuracy. We validate this methodology through a real-world application for a plastics manufacturing plant and the Skoltech Anomaly Benchmark (SKAB). Results show significant improvements over our previous model with an accuracy increase from 70.7% to 88.6% on the real-world dataset. By allowing for the enriching of input series data with semantics, RAAD-LLM incorporates multimodal capabilities that facilitate more collaborative decision-making between the model and plant operators. Overall, our findings support RAAD-LLM's ability to revolutionize anomaly detection methodologies in PdM, potentially leading to a paradigm shift in how anomaly detection is implemented across various industries.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2411.00914</p></details> |

To bridge this gap, we introduce OpenRAG, a RAG framework that is optimized end-to-end by tuning the retriever to capture in-context relevance, enabling adaptation to the diverse and evolving needs. Extensive experiments across a wide range of tasks demonstrate that OpenRAG, by tuning a retriever end-to-end, leads to a consistent improvement of 4.0% over the original retriever, consistently outperforming existing state-of-the-art retrievers by 2.1%. Additionally, our results indicate that for some tasks, an end-to-end tuned 0.2B retriever can achieve improvements that surpass those of RAG-oriented or instruction-tuned 8B large language models (LLMs), highlighting the cost-effectiveness of our approach in enhancing RAG systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[OCR Hinders RAG: Evaluating the Cascading Impact of OCR on Retrieval-Augmented Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02592v2)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating external knowledge to reduce hallucinations and incorporate up-to-date information without retraining. As an essential part of RAG, external knowledge bases are commonly built by extracting structured data from unstructured PDF documents using Optical Character Recognition (OCR). However, given the imperfect prediction of OCR and the inherent non-uniform representation of structured data, knowledge bases inevitably contain various OCR noises. In this paper, we introduce OHRBench, the first benchmark for understanding the cascading impact of OCR on RAG systems. OHRBench includes 8,561 carefully selected unstructured document images from seven real-world RAG application domains, along with 8,498 Q&A pairs derived from multimodal elements in documents, challenging existing OCR solutions used for RAG. To better understand OCR's impact on RAG systems, we identify two primary types of OCR noise: Semantic Noise and Formatting Noise and apply perturbation to generate a set of structured data with varying degrees of each OCR noise. Using OHRBench, we first conduct a comprehensive evaluation of current OCR solutions and reveal that none is competent for constructing high-quality knowledge bases for RAG systems. We then systematically evaluate the impact of these two noise types and demonstrate the trend relationship between the degree of OCR noise and RAG performance. Our OHRBench, including PDF documents, Q&As, and the ground truth structured data are released at: https://github.com/opendatalab/OHR-Bench</p></details> | Work in progress |

We demonstrate that RAG systems that operate on databases with untrusted content are vulnerable to denial-of-service attacks we call jamming. An adversary can add a single ``blocker'' document to the database that will be retrieved in response to a specific query and result in the RAG system not answering this query, ostensibly because it lacks relevant information or because the answer is unsafe. We describe and measure the efficacy of several methods for generating blocker documents, including a new method based on black-box optimization. Our method (1) does not rely on instruction injection, (2) does not require the adversary to know the embedding or LLM used by the target RAG system, and (3) does not employ an auxiliary LLM. We evaluate jamming attacks on several embeddings and LLMs and demonstrate that the existing safety metrics for LLMs do not capture their vulnerability to jamming. We then discuss defenses against blocker documents.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in USENIX Security Symposium 2025</p></details> |

However, the specialized nature of biochemical data often necessitates costly domain-specific fine-tuning, posing critical challenges. First, it hinders the application of more flexible general-purpose LLMs in cutting-edge drug discovery tasks. More importantly, it impedes the rapid integration of the vast amounts of scientific data continuously generated through experiments and research. To investigate these challenges, we propose CLADD, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-empowered agentic system tailored to drug discovery tasks. Through the collaboration of multiple LLM agents, CLADD dynamically retrieves information from biomedical knowledge bases, contextualizes query molecules, and integrates relevant evidence to generate responses -- all without the need for domain-specific fine-tuning. Crucially, we tackle key obstacles in applying RAG workflows to biochemical data, including data heterogeneity, ambiguity, and multi-source integration. We demonstrate the flexibility and effectiveness of this framework across a variety of drug discovery tasks, showing that it outperforms general-purpose and domain-specific LLMs as well as traditional deep learning approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Machi...</summary><p>Machine Learning, Drug Discovery</p></details> |

However, these modules are usually separately trained. We argue that a system like RAG that incorporates multiple modules should be jointly optimized to achieve optimal performance. To demonstrate this, we design a specific pipeline called \textbf{SmartRAG} that includes a policy network and a retriever. The policy network can serve as 1) a decision maker that decides when to retrieve, 2) a query rewriter to generate a query most suited to the retriever, and 3) an answer generator that produces the final response with/without the observations. We then propose to jointly optimize the whole system using a reinforcement learning algorithm, with the reward designed to encourage the system to achieve the best performance with minimal retrieval cost. When jointly optimized, all the modules can be aware of how other modules are working and thus find the best way to work together as a complete system. Empirical results demonstrate that the jointly optimized SmartRAG can achieve better performance than separately optimized counterparts.</p></details> |  |

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising solution to enhance LLMs accuracy by incorporating external knowledge. However, traditional RAG systems struggle with processing complex relational information and multi-step reasoning, limiting their effectiveness in advanced problem-solving tasks. To address these limitations, we propose CogGRAG, a cognition inspired graph-based RAG framework, designed to improve LLMs performance in Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA). Inspired by the human cognitive process of decomposing complex problems and performing self-verification, our framework introduces a three-stage methodology: decomposition, retrieval, and reasoning with self-verification. By integrating these components, CogGRAG enhances the accuracy of LLMs in complex problem solving. We conduct systematic experiments with three LLM backbones on four benchmark datasets, where CogGRAG outperforms the baselines.</p></details> |  |

While RAG enhances MLLMs by grounding responses in query-relevant external knowledge, this reliance poses a critical yet underexplored safety risk: knowledge poisoning attacks, where misinformation or irrelevant knowledge is intentionally injected into external knowledge bases to manipulate model outputs to be incorrect and even harmful. To expose such vulnerabilities in multimodal RAG, we propose MM-PoisonRAG, a novel knowledge poisoning attack framework with two attack strategies: Localized Poisoning Attack (LPA), which injects query-specific misinformation in both text and images for targeted manipulation, and Globalized Poisoning Attack (GPA) to provide false guidance during MLLM generation to elicit nonsensical responses across all queries. We evaluate our attacks across multiple tasks, models, and access settings, demonstrating that LPA successfully manipulates the MLLM to generate attacker-controlled answers, with a success rate of up to 56% on MultiModalQA. Moreover, GPA completely disrupts model generation to 0% accuracy with just a single irrelevant knowledge injection. Our results highlight the urgent need for robust defenses against knowledge poisoning to safeguard multimodal RAG frameworks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is available at https://github.com/HyeonjeongHa/MM-PoisonRAG</p></details> |

Although these speech act indicators communicate the user\textquotesingle s intent -- whether it is asking a question, making a request, or stating a fact -- they do not necessarily add to the core informational content of the query itself. This paper investigates whether extracting the underlying propositional content from user utterances -- essentially stripping away the linguistic markers of intent -- can improve retrieval quality in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Drawing upon foundational insights from speech act theory, we propose a practical method for automatically transforming queries into their propositional equivalents before embedding. To assess the efficacy of this approach, we conducted an experimental study involving 63 user queries related to a Brazilian telecommunications news corpus with precomputed semantic embeddings. Results demonstrate clear improvements in semantic similarity between query embeddings and document embeddings at top ranks, confirming that queries stripped of speech act indicators more effectively retrieve relevant content.</p></details> | 19 pages, 4 figures |

Built from heterologous data of NASDAQ 100 companies, FinTMMBench offers three significant advantages. 1) Multi-modal Corpus: It encompasses a hybrid of financial tables, news articles, daily stock prices, and visual technical charts as the corpus. 2) Temporal-aware Questions: Each question requires the retrieval and interpretation of its relevant data over a specific time period, including daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, and annual periods. 3) Diverse Financial Analysis Tasks: The questions involve 10 different tasks, including information extraction, trend analysis, sentiment analysis and event detection, etc. We further propose a novel TMMHybridRAG method, which first leverages LLMs to convert data from other modalities (e.g., tabular, visual and time-series data) into textual format and then incorporates temporal information in each node when constructing graphs and dense indexes. Its effectiveness has been validated in extensive experiments, but notable gaps remain, highlighting the challenges presented by our FinTMMBench.</p></details> | Under review |

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) fetches evidence via similarity search, but key information may fall outside top ranked results. Long-context models can process multiple documents but are computationally expensive and limited by context window size. Inspired by students condensing study material for open-book exams, we propose task-aware key-value (KV) cache compression, which compresses external knowledge in a zero- or few-shot setup. This enables LLMs to reason efficiently over a compacted representation of all relevant information. Experiments show our approach outperforms both RAG and task-agnostic compression methods. On LongBench v2, it improves accuracy by up to 7 absolute points over RAG with a 30x compression rate, while reducing inference latency from 0.43s to 0.16s. A synthetic dataset highlights that RAG performs well when sparse evidence suffices, whereas task-aware compression is superior for broad knowledge tasks.</p></details> |  |

Although previous studies noted that retrieving many documents can degrade performance, they did not isolate how the quantity of documents affects performance while controlling for context length. We evaluate various language models on custom datasets derived from a multi-hop QA task. We keep the context length and position of relevant information constant while varying the number of documents, and find that increasing the document count in RAG settings poses significant challenges for LLMs. Additionally, our results indicate that processing multiple documents is a separate challenge from handling long contexts. We also make the datasets and code available: https://github.com/shaharl6000/MoreDocsSameLen .</p></details> | Preprint |

A number of graph-based RAG methods have been proposed in the literature. However, these methods have not been systematically and comprehensively compared under the same experimental settings. In this paper, we first summarize a unified framework to incorporate all graph-based RAG methods from a high-level perspective. We then extensively compare representative graph-based RAG methods over a range of questing-answering (QA) datasets -- from specific questions to abstract questions -- and examine the effectiveness of all methods, providing a thorough analysis of graph-based RAG approaches. As a byproduct of our experimental analysis, we are also able to identify new variants of the graph-based RAG methods over specific QA and abstract QA tasks respectively, by combining existing techniques, which outperform the state-of-the-art methods. Finally, based on these findings, we offer promising research opportunities. We believe that a deeper understanding of the behavior of existing methods can provide new valuable insights for future research.</p></details> |  |

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers an effective method for achieving this by retrieving the most relevant fragments into LLMs. However, the advancements in context window size for LLMs offer an alternative approach, raising the question of whether RAG remains necessary for effectively handling external knowledge. Several existing studies provide inconclusive comparisons between RAG and long-context (LC) LLMs, largely due to limitations in the benchmark designs. In this paper, we present LaRA, a novel benchmark specifically designed to rigorously compare RAG and LC LLMs. LaRA encompasses 2326 test cases across four practical QA task categories and three types of naturally occurring long texts. Through systematic evaluation of seven open-source and four proprietary LLMs, we find that the optimal choice between RAG and LC depends on a complex interplay of factors, including the model's parameter size, long-text capabilities, context length, task type, and the characteristics of the retrieved chunks. Our findings provide actionable guidelines for practitioners to effectively leverage both RAG and LC approaches in developing and deploying LLM applications.

While many studies focus on evaluating the overall quality of end-to-end RAG systems, there is a gap in understanding the appropriateness of LLMs for the RAG task. To address this, we introduce Trust-Score, a holistic metric that evaluates the trustworthiness of LLMs within the RAG framework. Our results show that various prompting methods, such as in-context learning, fail to effectively adapt LLMs to the RAG task as measured by Trust-Score. Consequently, we propose Trust-Align, a method to align LLMs for improved Trust-Score performance. 26 out of 27 models aligned using Trust-Align substantially outperform competitive baselines on ASQA, QAMPARI, and ELI5. Specifically, in LLaMA-3-8b, Trust-Align outperforms FRONT on ASQA (up 12.56), QAMPARI (up 36.04), and ELI5 (up 17.69). Trust-Align also significantly enhances models' ability to correctly refuse and provide quality citations. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of Trust-Align across different open-weight models, including the LLaMA series (1b to 8b), Qwen-2.5 series (0.5b to 7b), and Phi3.5 (3.8b).

However, evaluating the effectiveness of RAG systems in specialized scenarios remains challenging due to the high costs of data construction and the lack of suitable evaluation metrics. This paper introduces RAGEval, a framework designed to assess RAG systems across diverse scenarios by generating high-quality documents, questions, answers, and references through a schema-based pipeline. With a focus on factual accuracy, we propose three novel metrics: Completeness, Hallucination, and Irrelevance to evaluate LLM generated responses rigorously. Experimental results show that RAGEval outperforms zero-shot and one-shot methods in terms of clarity, safety, conformity, and richness of generated samples. Furthermore, the use of LLMs for scoring the proposed metrics demonstrates a high level of consistency with human evaluations. RAGEval establishes a new paradigm for evaluating RAG systems in real-world applications.

| **[SAGE: A Framework of Precise Retrieval for RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01713v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has demonstrated significant proficiency in conducting question-answering (QA) tasks within a specified corpus. Nonetheless, numerous failure instances of RAG in QA still exist. These failures are not solely attributable to the limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs); instead, they predominantly arise from the retrieval of inaccurate information for LLMs due to two limitations: (1) Current RAG methods segment the corpus without considering semantics, making it difficult to find relevant context due to impaired correlation between questions and the segments. (2) There is a trade-off between missing essential context with fewer context retrieved and getting irrelevant context with more context retrieved. In this paper, we introduce a RAG framework (SAGE), to overcome these limitations. First, to address the segmentation issue without considering semantics, we propose to train a semantic segmentation model. This model is trained to segment the corpus into semantically complete chunks. Second, to ensure that only the most relevant chunks are retrieved while the irrelevant ones are ignored, we design a chunk selection algorithm to dynamically select chunks based on the decreasing speed of the relevance score, leading to a more relevant selection. Third, to further ensure the precision of the retrieved chunks, we propose letting LLMs assess whether retrieved chunks are excessive or lacking and then adjust the amount of context accordingly. Experiments show that SAGE outperforms baselines by 61.25% in the quality of QA on average. Moreover, by avoiding retrieving noisy context, SAGE lowers the cost of the tokens consumed in LLM inference and achieves a 49.41% enhancement in cost efficiency on average. Additionally, our work offers valuable insights for boosting RAG.</p></details> |  |

To overcome the limitations of existing methods, this paper shifts away from prior dedicated heuristic approaches and revisits the most fundamental idea to HR perception by enhancing the long-context capability of MLLMs, driven by recent advances in long-context techniques like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for general LLMs. Towards this end, this paper presents the first study exploring the use of RAG to address HR perception challenges. Specifically, we propose Retrieval-Augmented Perception (RAP), a training-free framework that retrieves and fuses relevant image crops while preserving spatial context using the proposed Spatial-Awareness Layout. To accommodate different tasks, the proposed Retrieved-Exploration Search (RE-Search) dynamically selects the optimal number of crops based on model confidence and retrieval scores. Experimental results on HR benchmarks demonstrate the significant effectiveness of RAP, with LLaVA-v1.5-13B achieving a 43% improvement on $V^*$ Bench and 19% on HR-Bench.</p></details> |  |

Recent progress in Medical Large Vision-Language Models (Med-LVLMs) has opened up new possibilities for interactive diagnostic tools. However, these models often suffer from factual hallucination, which can lead to incorrect diagnoses. Fine-tuning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) have emerged as methods to address these issues. However, the amount of high-quality data and distribution shifts between training data and deployment data limit the application of fine-tuning methods. Although RAG is lightweight and effective, existing RAG-based approaches are not sufficiently general to different medical domains and can potentially cause misalignment issues, both between modalities and between the model and the ground truth. In this paper, we propose a versatile multimodal RAG system, MMed-RAG, designed to enhance the factuality of Med-LVLMs. Our approach introduces a domain-aware retrieval mechanism, an adaptive retrieved contexts selection method, and a provable RAG-based preference fine-tuning strategy. These innovations make the RAG process sufficiently general and reliable, significantly improving alignment when introducing retrieved contexts. Experimental results across five medical datasets (involving radiology, ophthalmology, pathology) on medical VQA and report generation demonstrate that MMed-RAG can achieve an average improvement of 43.8% in the factual accuracy of Med-LVLMs. Our data and code are available in https://github.com/richard-peng-xia/MMed-RAG.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

We conducted extensive benchmarking to select the optimal embedding model and LLM, evaluating our framework based on criteria such as latency, faithfulness, and relevance, with additional validation through human evaluation. Our chatbot integrates state-of-the-art embedding models and LLMs to deliver accurate, context-aware responses. Through rigorous experimentation, we identified configurations that balance performance and computational efficiency, ensuring a reliable chatbot to serve students' needs. Additionally, we discuss the challenges faced in data processing and modeling and implemented solutions. Our work explores the application of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for GATE Q/A explanation tasks, and our findings demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval accuracy and response quality. This research offers practical insights for developing effective AI-driven educational tools while highlighting areas for future enhancement in usability and scalability.</p></details> |  |

However, current RAG methods rely on agent-specific strategies for individual data sources, posing challenges low-resource or black-box environments and complicates operations when evidence is fragmented across sources. To address these limitations, we propose ER-RAG, a framework that unifies evidence integration across heterogeneous data sources using the Entity-Relationship (ER) model. ER-RAG standardizes entity retrieval and relationship querying through ER-based APIs with GET and JOIN operations. It employs a two-stage generation process: first, a preference optimization module selects optimal sources; second, another module constructs API chains based on source schemas. This unified approach allows efficient fine-tuning and seamless integration across diverse data sources. ER-RAG demonstrated its effectiveness by winning all three tracks of the 2024 KDDCup CRAG Challenge, achieving performance on par with commercial RAG pipelines using an 8B LLM backbone. It outperformed hybrid competitors by 3.1% in LLM score and accelerated retrieval by 5.5X.</p></details> |  |
| **[Post-training an LLM for RAG? Train on Self-Generated Demonstrations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10596v2)** | 2025-03-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) often struggle with knowledge intensive NLP tasks, such as answering "Who won the latest World Cup?" because the knowledge they learn during training may be insufficient or outdated. Conditioning generation on retrieved documents -- a technique known as retrieval augmented generation (RAG) -- mitigates these shortcomings by allowing the model to leverage in-context information. Practitioners can improve LLM RAG performance by fine-tuning on retrieval-augmented instructions, but must beware that this can cause undesirable model behaviors like hallucinations. We attribute this degradation to the fact that the training data is likely to be out-of-distribution for the model and may suffer from quality issues, such as misalignment between retrievals and target responses (since retrievals are frequently added post-hoc). We propose a recipe for training RAG-enabled LLMs using self-generated demonstrations, thereby avoiding training on out-of-distribution text and integrating retrievals into the LLM responses. We evaluate our method on knowledge intensive question answering (QA) tasks and show that our method teaches LLMs to properly handle in-context retrievals and abstain from questions it will likely get wrong. Compared to conventional RA-IT methods, our method prevents model degradation in non-RAG settings while exhibiting superior QA performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[U-NIAH: Unified RAG and LLM Evaluation for Long Context Needle-In-A-Haystack](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00353v1)** | 2025-03-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have expanded their context windows to unprecedented lengths, sparking debates about the necessity of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). To address the fragmented evaluation paradigms and limited cases in existing Needle-in-a-Haystack (NIAH), this paper introduces U-NIAH, a unified framework that systematically compares LLMs and RAG methods in controlled long context settings. Our framework extends beyond traditional NIAH by incorporating multi-needle, long-needle, and needle-in-needle configurations, along with different retrieval settings, while leveraging the synthetic Starlight Academy dataset-a fictional magical universe-to eliminate biases from pre-trained knowledge. Through extensive experiments, we investigate three research questions: (1) performance trade-offs between LLMs and RAG, (2) error patterns in RAG, and (3) RAG's limitations in complex settings. Our findings show that RAG significantly enhances smaller LLMs by mitigating the "lost-in-the-middle" effect and improving robustness, achieving an 82.58% win-rate over LLMs. However, we observe that retrieval noise and reverse chunk ordering degrade performance, while surprisingly, advanced reasoning LLMs exhibit reduced RAG compatibility due to sensitivity to semantic distractors. We identify typical error patterns including omission due to noise, hallucination under high noise critical condition, and self-doubt behaviors. Our work not only highlights the complementary roles of RAG and LLMs, but also provides actionable insights for optimizing deployments.

However, these models face challenges in retrieving precise information from vast datasets. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) was developed to combining LLMs with external information retrieval systems to enhance the accuracy and context of responses. Despite improvements, RAG still struggles with comprehensive retrieval in high-volume, low-information-density databases and lacks relational awareness, leading to fragmented answers. To address this, this paper introduces the Pseudo-Knowledge Graph (PKG) framework, designed to overcome these limitations by integrating Meta-path Retrieval, In-graph Text and Vector Retrieval into LLMs. By preserving natural language text and leveraging various retrieval techniques, the PKG offers a richer knowledge representation and improves accuracy in information retrieval. Extensive evaluations using Open Compass and MultiHop-RAG benchmarks demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in managing large volumes of data and complex relationships.</p></details> |  |

However, these methods rely on unrealistic white-box assumptions, such as attackers having access to RAG systems' internal processes. To address this issue, we introduce a realistic black-box attack scenario based on the RAG paradox, where RAG systems inadvertently expose vulnerabilities while attempting to enhance trustworthiness. Because RAG systems reference external documents during response generation, our attack targets these sources without requiring internal access. Our approach first identifies the external sources disclosed by RAG systems and then automatically generates poisoned documents with misinformation designed to match these sources. Finally, these poisoned documents are newly published on the disclosed sources, disrupting the RAG system's response generation process. Both offline and online experiments confirm that this attack significantly reduces RAG performance without requiring internal access. Furthermore, from an insider perspective within the RAG system, we propose a re-ranking method that acts as a fundamental safeguard, offering minimal protection against unforeseen attacks.</p></details> |  |

Different from traditional RAG methods that mostly deal with flat text chunks, the proposed method takes into account the relationship of multimodalities by using a graph structure. To do that, a graph modeling structure is defined based on document layout parsing. The structure of an input document is retained with the connection of text chunks, tables, and figures. This representation allows the method to handle complex questions that require information from multimodalities. To confirm the efficiency of the graph modeling, a flexible RAG pipeline is developed using robust components. Experimental results on four benchmark test sets confirm the contribution of the layout-aware modeling for performance improvement of the RAG pipeline.</p></details> | <details><summary>NAACL...</summary><p>NAACL 2025, Industry Track</p></details> |

Recent RAG advancements focus on improving retrieval outcomes through iterative LLM refinement or self-critique capabilities acquired through additional instruction tuning of LLMs. In this work, we introduce Speculative RAG - a framework that leverages a larger generalist LM to efficiently verify multiple RAG drafts produced in parallel by a smaller, distilled specialist LM. Each draft is generated from a distinct subset of retrieved documents, offering diverse perspectives on the evidence while reducing input token counts per draft. This approach enhances comprehension of each subset and mitigates potential position bias over long context. Our method accelerates RAG by delegating drafting to the smaller specialist LM, with the larger generalist LM performing a single verification pass over the drafts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Speculative RAG achieves state-of-the-art performance with reduced latency on TriviaQA, MuSiQue, PopQA, PubHealth, and ARC-Challenge benchmarks. It notably enhances accuracy by up to 12.97% while reducing latency by 50.83% compared to conventional RAG systems on PubHealth.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025</p></details> |

Biomedical code mapping identifies similarity or equivalence between concepts from different ontologies. Obtaining high-quality mapping usually relies on automatic generation of unrefined mapping with ontology domain fine-tuned language models (LMs), followed by manual selections or corrections by coding experts who have extensive domain expertise and familiarity with ontology schemas. The LMs usually provide unrefined code mapping suggestions as a list of candidates without reasoning or supporting evidence, hence coding experts still need to verify each suggested candidate against ontology sources to pick the best matches. This is also a recurring task as ontology sources are updated regularly to incorporate new research findings. Consequently, the need of regular LM retraining and manual refinement make code mapping time-consuming and labour intensive. In this work, we created OntologyRAG, an ontology-enhanced retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) method that leverages the inductive biases from ontological knowledge graphs for in-context-learning (ICL) in large language models (LLMs). Our solution grounds LLMs to knowledge graphs with unrefined mappings between ontologies and processes questions by generating an interpretable set of results that include prediction rational with mapping proximity assessment. Our solution doesn't require re-training LMs, as all ontology updates could be reflected by updating the knowledge graphs with a standard process. Evaluation results on a self-curated gold dataset show promises of using our method to enable coding experts to achieve better and faster code mapping. The code is available at https://github.com/iqvianlp/ontologyRAG.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted as a workshop paper for KEIR@ECIR 2025</p></details> |

This includes the LLM, embedding, and ranker models themselves, as well as hyperparameters governing individual RAG components. Yet, collectively optimizing the entire configuration in a RAG or LLM system remains under-explored - especially in multi-objective settings - due to intractably large solution spaces, noisy objective evaluations, and the high cost of evaluations. In this work, we introduce the first approach for multi-objective parameter optimization of cost, latency, safety and alignment over entire LLM and RAG systems. We find that Bayesian optimization methods significantly outperform baseline approaches, obtaining a superior Pareto front on two new RAG benchmark tasks. We conclude our work with important considerations for practitioners who are designing multi-objective RAG systems, highlighting nuances such as how optimal configurations may not generalize across tasks and objectives.</p></details> |  |
| **[Ward: Provable RAG Dataset Inference via LLM Watermarks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03537v2)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>RAG enables LLMs to easily incorporate external data, raising concerns for data owners regarding unauthorized usage of their content. The challenge of detecting such unauthorized usage remains underexplored, with datasets and methods from adjacent fields being ill-suited for its study. We take several steps to bridge this gap. First, we formalize this problem as (black-box) RAG Dataset Inference (RAG-DI). We then introduce a novel dataset designed for realistic benchmarking of RAG-DI methods, alongside a set of baselines. Finally, we propose Ward, a method for RAG-DI based on LLM watermarks that equips data owners with rigorous statistical guarantees regarding their dataset's misuse in RAG corpora. Ward consistently outperforms all baselines, achieving higher accuracy, superior query efficiency and robustness. Our work provides a foundation for future studies of RAG-DI and highlights LLM watermarks as a promising approach to this problem.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

Yet, most existing work in RAG has underemphasized fair ranking techniques and neglected the diverse interests of all stakeholders. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study of RAG systems that incorporate fairness-aware rankings, focusing on both ranking fairness and attribution fairness - ensuring equitable exposure of sources cited in the final text. We specifically examine item-side fairness, i.e., whether retrieved documents receive balanced exposure, and assess how this affects both the system's overall performance and the eventual distribution of cited sources. Across twelve RAG models and seven tasks, we find that fairness-aware retrieval frequently retains or even improves ranking effectiveness and generation quality, countering the widespread belief that fairness compromises system performance. Moreover, we show that fair retrieval leads to more balanced attribution in the final responses, ensuring that the cited sources are credited more equitably. Our results underscore the importance of item-side fairness throughout both retrieval and generation phases, offering key insights for building more responsible and equitable RAG systems and illustrating promising avenues for future exploration in fair ranking and source attribution.</p></details> | <details><summary>Top 5...</summary><p>Top 5 Spotlight at AFME Workshop at NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |
| **[Evaluating the Effectiveness and Efficiency of Demonstration Retrievers in RAG for Coding Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09662v2)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating external knowledge bases, achieving state-of-the-art results in various coding tasks. The core of RAG is retrieving demonstration examples, which is essential to balance effectiveness (generation quality) and efficiency (retrieval time) for optimal performance. However, the high-dimensional nature of code representations and large knowledge bases often create efficiency bottlenecks, which are overlooked in previous research. This paper systematically evaluates the efficiency-effectiveness trade-off of retrievers across three coding tasks: Program Synthesis, Commit Message Generation, and Assertion Generation. We examined six retrievers: two sparse (BM25 and BM25L) and four dense retrievers, including one exhaustive dense retriever (SBERT's Semantic Search) and three approximate dense retrievers (ANNOY, LSH, and HNSW). Our findings show that while BM25 excels in effectiveness, it suffers in efficiency as the knowledge base grows beyond 1000 entries. In large-scale retrieval, efficiency differences become more pronounced, with approximate dense retrievers offering the greatest gains. For instance, in Commit Generation task, HNSW achieves a 44x speed up, while only with a 1.74% drop in RougeL compared with BM25. Our results also show that increasing the number of demonstrations in the prompt doesn't always improve the effectiveness and can increase latency and lead to incorrect outputs. Our findings provide valuable insights for practitioners aiming to build efficient and effective RAG systems for coding tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 6 figures, 6 tables, accepted by SANER 2025</p></details> |
| **[Mitigating Bias in RAG: Controlling the Embedder](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17390v1)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In retrieval augmented generation (RAG) systems, each individual component -- the LLM, embedder, and corpus -- could introduce biases in the form of skews towards outputting certain perspectives or identities. In this work, we study the conflict between biases of each component and their relationship to the overall bias of the RAG system, which we call bias conflict. Examining both gender and political biases as case studies, we show that bias conflict can be characterized through a linear relationship among components despite its complexity in 6 different LLMs. Through comprehensive fine-tuning experiments creating 120 differently biased embedders, we demonstrate how to control bias while maintaining utility and reveal the importance of reverse-biasing the embedder to mitigate bias in the overall system. Additionally, we find that LLMs and tasks exhibit varying sensitivities to the embedder bias, a crucial factor to consider for debiasing. Our results underscore that a fair RAG system can be better achieved by carefully controlling the bias of the embedder rather than increasing its fairness.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages (8 main), 12 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

We present LettuceDetect a framework that addresses two critical limitations in existing hallucination detection methods: (1) the context window constraints of traditional encoder-based methods, and (2) the computational inefficiency of LLM based approaches. Building on ModernBERT's extended context capabilities (up to 8k tokens) and trained on the RAGTruth benchmark dataset, our approach outperforms all previous encoder-based models and most prompt-based models, while being approximately 30 times smaller than the best models. LettuceDetect is a token-classification model that processes context-question-answer triples, allowing for the identification of unsupported claims at the token level. Evaluations on the RAGTruth corpus demonstrate an F1 score of 79.22% for example-level detection, which is a 14.8% improvement over Luna, the previous state-of-the-art encoder-based architecture. Additionally, the system can process 30 to 60 examples per second on a single GPU, making it more practical for real-world RAG applications.</p></details> | 6 pages |

However, RAG introduces challenges such as retrieval latency, potential errors in document selection, and increased system complexity. With the advent of large language models (LLMs) featuring significantly extended context windows, this paper proposes an alternative paradigm, cache-augmented generation (CAG) that bypasses real-time retrieval. Our method involves preloading all relevant resources, especially when the documents or knowledge for retrieval are of a limited and manageable size, into the LLM's extended context and caching its runtime parameters. During inference, the model utilizes these preloaded parameters to answer queries without additional retrieval steps. Comparative analyses reveal that CAG eliminates retrieval latency and minimizes retrieval errors while maintaining context relevance. Performance evaluations across multiple benchmarks highlight scenarios where long-context LLMs either outperform or complement traditional RAG pipelines. These findings suggest that, for certain applications, particularly those with a constrained knowledge base, CAG provide a streamlined and efficient alternative to RAG, achieving comparable or superior results with reduced complexity.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, accepted by the Web Conference 2025 (WWW '25) as a short paper</p></details> |
| **[Worse than Zero-shot? A Fact-Checking Dataset for Evaluating the Robustness of RAG Against Misleading Retrievals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16101v1)** | 2025-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has shown impressive capabilities in mitigating hallucinations in large language models (LLMs). However, LLMs struggle to handle misleading retrievals and often fail to maintain their own reasoning when exposed to conflicting or selectively-framed evidence, making them vulnerable to real-world misinformation. In such real-world retrieval scenarios, misleading and conflicting information is rampant, particularly in the political domain, where evidence is often selectively framed, incomplete, or polarized. However, existing RAG benchmarks largely assume a clean retrieval setting, where models succeed by accurately retrieving and generating answers from gold-standard documents. This assumption fails to align with real-world conditions, leading to an overestimation of RAG system performance. To bridge this gap, we introduce RAGuard, a fact-checking dataset designed to evaluate the robustness of RAG systems against misleading retrievals. Unlike prior benchmarks that rely on synthetic noise, our dataset constructs its retrieval corpus from Reddit discussions, capturing naturally occurring misinformation. It categorizes retrieved evidence into three types: supporting, misleading, and irrelevant, providing a realistic and challenging testbed for assessing how well RAG systems navigate different retrieval information. Our benchmark experiments reveal that when exposed to misleading retrievals, all tested LLM-powered RAG systems perform worse than their zero-shot baselines (i.e., no retrieval at all), highlighting their susceptibility to noisy environments. To the best of our knowledge, RAGuard is the first benchmark to systematically assess RAG robustness against misleading evidence. We expect this benchmark will drive future research toward improving RAG systems beyond idealized datasets, making them more reliable for real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

However, due to access restrictions, Large Language Models (LLMs) cannot retrieve these internal documents, limiting their ability to generate accurate zero-shot responses. To overcome this limitation, we use a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework powered by a Knowledge Graph (KG) to retrieve relevant information from external knowledge sources, enabling LLMs to answer questions over private or previously unseen document collections. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for building a high-quality, low-noise KG. We apply several techniques, including incremental entity resolution using seed concepts, similarity-based filtering to deduplicate entries, assigning confidence scores to entity-relation pairs to filter for high-confidence pairs, and linking facts to source documents for provenance. Our KG-RAG system retrieves relevant tuples, which are added to the user prompts context before being sent to the LLM generating the response. Our evaluation demonstrates that this approach significantly enhances response relevance, reducing irrelevant answers by over 50% and increasing fully relevant answers by 88% compared to the existing production system.</p></details> |  |
| **[Chain-of-Rank: Enhancing Large Language Models for Domain-Specific RAG in Edge Device](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15134v1)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with large language models (LLMs) is especially valuable in specialized domains, where precision is critical. To more specialize the LLMs into a target domain, domain-specific RAG has recently been developed by allowing the LLM to access the target domain early via finetuning. The domain-specific RAG makes more sense in resource-constrained environments like edge devices, as they should perform a specific task (e.g. personalization) reliably using only small-scale LLMs. While the domain-specific RAG is well-aligned with edge devices in this respect, it often relies on widely-used reasoning techniques like chain-of-thought (CoT). The reasoning step is useful to understand the given external knowledge, and yet it is computationally expensive and difficult for small-scale LLMs to learn it. Tackling this, we propose the Chain of Rank (CoR) which shifts the focus from intricate lengthy reasoning to simple ranking of the reliability of input external documents. Then, CoR reduces computational complexity while maintaining high accuracy, making it particularly suited for resource-constrained environments. We attain the state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in benchmarks, and analyze its efficacy.</p></details> | <details><summary>NAACL...</summary><p>NAACL 2025 (Findings)</p></details> |

Different from a standard retrieval task's objective of maximising the relevance of a set of top-ranked documents, a RAG system's objective is rather to maximise their total utility, where the utility of a document indicates whether including it as a part of the additional contextual information in an LLM prompt improves a downstream task. Existing studies investigate the role of the relevance of a RAG context for knowledge-intensive language tasks (KILT), where relevance essentially takes the form of answer containment. In contrast, in our work, relevance corresponds to that of topical overlap between a query and a document for an information seeking task. Specifically, we make use of an IR test collection to empirically investigate whether a RAG context comprised of topically relevant documents leads to improved downstream performance. Our experiments lead to the following findings: (a) there is a small positive correlation between relevance and utility; (b) this correlation decreases with increasing context sizes (higher values of k in k-shot); and (c) a more effective retrieval model generally leads to better downstream RAG performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages (including reference), 5 figures, 1 table, 48 references; this paper has been accepted by ECIR'25 as a full paper</p></details> |

Such agents have the potential for broad use. We illustrate with a sample application called CollabNext, which is a person-centric knowledge graph connecting people, organizations, and research topics.

Given the challenges in continual learning with large language models (LLMs), retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become the dominant way to introduce new information. However, its reliance on vector retrieval hinders its ability to mimic the dynamic and interconnected nature of human long-term memory. Recent RAG approaches augment vector embeddings with various structures like knowledge graphs to address some of these gaps, namely sense-making and associativity. However, their performance on more basic factual memory tasks drops considerably below standard RAG. We address this unintended deterioration and propose HippoRAG 2, a framework that outperforms standard RAG comprehensively on factual, sense-making, and associative memory tasks. HippoRAG 2 builds upon the Personalized PageRank algorithm used in HippoRAG and enhances it with deeper passage integration and more effective online use of an LLM. This combination pushes this RAG system closer to the effectiveness of human long-term memory, achieving a 7% improvement in associative memory tasks over the state-of-the-art embedding model while also exhibiting superior factual knowledge and sense-making memory capabilities.

However, when the retrieval process involves private data, RAG systems may face severe privacy risks, potentially leading to the leakage of sensitive information. To address this issue, we propose using synthetic data as a privacy-preserving alternative for the retrieval data. We propose SAGE, a novel two-stage synthetic data generation paradigm. In the stage-1, we employ an attribute-based extraction and generation approach to preserve key contextual information from the original data. In the stage-2, we further enhance the privacy properties of the synthetic data through an agent-based iterative refinement process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that using our synthetic data as the retrieval context achieves comparable performance to using the original data while substantially reducing privacy risks. Our work takes the first step towards investigating the possibility of generating high-utility and privacy-preserving synthetic data for RAG, opening up new opportunities for the safe application of RAG systems in various domains.</p></details> |  |

This is critical given existing workforce shortages, especially in marginalized communities like Underrepresented Minorities (URM), who often lack access to quality education. Addressing these challenges, this research presents gAI-PT4I4, a Generative AI-based Personalized Tutor for Industrial 4.0, designed to personalize 4IR experiential learning. gAI-PT4I4 employs sentiment analysis to assess student comprehension, leveraging generative AI and finite automaton to tailor learning experiences. The framework integrates low-fidelity Digital Twins for VR-based training, featuring an Interactive Tutor - a generative AI assistant providing real-time guidance via audio and text. It uses zero-shot sentiment analysis with LLMs and prompt engineering, achieving 86\% accuracy in classifying student-teacher interactions as positive or negative. Additionally, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enables personalized learning content grounded in domain-specific knowledge. To adapt training dynamically, finite automaton structures exercises into states of increasing difficulty, requiring 80\% task-performance accuracy for progression. Experimental evaluation with 22 volunteers showed improved accuracy exceeding 80\%, reducing training time. Finally, this paper introduces a Multi-Fidelity Digital Twin model, aligning Digital Twin complexity with Bloom's Taxonomy and Kirkpatrick's model, providing a scalable educational framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Local to Global: A Graph RAG Approach to Query-Focused Summarization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16130v2)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The use of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to retrieve relevant information from an external knowledge source enables large language models (LLMs) to answer questions over private and/or previously unseen document collections. However, RAG fails on global questions directed at an entire text corpus, such as "What are the main themes in the dataset?", since this is inherently a query-focused summarization (QFS) task, rather than an explicit retrieval task. Prior QFS methods, meanwhile, do not scale to the quantities of text indexed by typical RAG systems. To combine the strengths of these contrasting methods, we propose GraphRAG, a graph-based approach to question answering over private text corpora that scales with both the generality of user questions and the quantity of source text. Our approach uses an LLM to build a graph index in two stages: first, to derive an entity knowledge graph from the source documents, then to pregenerate community summaries for all groups of closely related entities. Given a question, each community summary is used to generate a partial response, before all partial responses are again summarized in a final response to the user. For a class of global sensemaking questions over datasets in the 1 million token range, we show that GraphRAG leads to substantial improvements over a conventional RAG baseline for both the comprehensiveness and diversity of generated answers.</p></details> |  |

To comprehensively evaluate the resilience of current RAG methods, we introduce HawkBench, a human-labeled, multi-domain benchmark designed to rigorously assess RAG performance across categorized task types. By stratifying tasks based on information-seeking behaviors, HawkBench provides a systematic evaluation of how well RAG systems adapt to diverse user needs. Unlike existing benchmarks, which focus primarily on specific task types (mostly factoid queries) and rely on varying knowledge bases, HawkBench offers: (1) systematic task stratification to cover a broad range of query types, including both factoid and rationale queries, (2) integration of multi-domain corpora across all task types to mitigate corpus bias, and (3) rigorous annotation for high-quality evaluation. HawkBench includes 1,600 high-quality test samples, evenly distributed across domains and task types. Using this benchmark, we evaluate representative RAG methods, analyzing their performance in terms of answer quality and response latency. Our findings highlight the need for dynamic task strategies that integrate decision-making, query interpretation, and global knowledge understanding to improve RAG generalizability. We believe HawkBench serves as a pivotal benchmark for advancing the resilience of RAG methods and their ability to achieve general-purpose information seeking.</p></details> | 13 pages |

It has been shown to enhance both generation quality and trustworthiness. While numerous works have focused on improving retrieval, generation, and evaluation, the role of reward models in reinforcement learning for optimizing RAG remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{RAG-Reward}, a framework designed to develop reward models to enable \textit{hallucination-free, comprehensive, reliable, and efficient RAG}. We define four key metrics to assess generation quality and develop an automated benchmarking pipeline to evaluate the outputs of multiple LLMs across a variety of RAG scenarios. Using \textbf{RAG-Reward}, we train reward models and apply {reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF)} to improve LLMs' effectiveness in RAG. Experimental results demonstrate that our reward model achieves state-of-the-art performance in automatic benchmarking and aligns closely with human evaluations. Furthermore, the improved generation quality of the trained policy model highlights the feasibility and efficiency of using RLHF to enhance RAG outputs.</p></details> | Preprint |

In this paper, we introduce an omnidirectional and automatic RAG benchmark, OmniEval, in the financial domain. Our benchmark is characterized by its multi-dimensional evaluation framework, including (1) a matrix-based RAG scenario evaluation system that categorizes queries into five task classes and 16 financial topics, leading to a structured assessment of diverse query scenarios; (2) a multi-dimensional evaluation data generation approach, which combines GPT-4-based automatic generation and human annotation, achieving an 87.47\% acceptance ratio in human evaluations on generated instances; (3) a multi-stage evaluation system that evaluates both retrieval and generation performance, result in a comprehensive evaluation on the RAG pipeline; and (4) robust evaluation metrics derived from rule-based and LLM-based ones, enhancing the reliability of assessments through manual annotations and supervised fine-tuning of an LLM evaluator. Our experiments demonstrate the comprehensiveness of OmniEval, which includes extensive test datasets and highlights the performance variations of RAG systems across diverse topics and tasks, revealing significant opportunities for RAG models to improve their capabilities in vertical domains. We open source the code of our benchmark in \href{https://github.com/RUC-NLPIR/OmniEval}{https://github.com/RUC-NLPIR/OmniEval}.</p></details> |  |
| **[Does RAG Really Perform Bad For Long-Context Processing?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11444v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The efficient processing of long context poses a serious challenge for large language models (LLMs). Recently, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising strategy for this problem, as it enables LLMs to make selective use of the long context for efficient computation. However, existing RAG approaches lag behind other long-context processing methods due to inherent limitations on inaccurate retrieval and fragmented contexts. To address these challenges, we introduce RetroLM, a novel RAG framework for long-context processing. Unlike traditional methods, RetroLM employs KV-level retrieval augmentation, where it partitions the LLM's KV cache into contiguous pages and retrieves the most crucial ones for efficient computation. This approach enhances robustness to retrieval inaccuracy, facilitates effective utilization of fragmented contexts, and saves the cost from repeated computation. Building on this framework, we further develop a specialized retriever for precise retrieval of critical pages and conduct unsupervised post-training to optimize the model's ability to leverage retrieved information. We conduct comprehensive evaluations with a variety of benchmarks, including LongBench, InfiniteBench, and RULER, where RetroLM significantly outperforms existing long-context LLMs and efficient long-context processing methods, particularly in tasks requiring intensive reasoning or extremely long-context comprehension.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revisiting Robust RAG: Do We Still Need Complex Robust Training in the Era of Powerful LLMs?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11400v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems often suffer from performance degradation when encountering noisy or irrelevant documents, driving researchers to develop sophisticated training strategies to enhance their robustness against such retrieval noise. However, as large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, the necessity of these complex training methods is increasingly questioned. In this paper, we systematically investigate whether complex robust training strategies remain necessary as model capacity grows. Through comprehensive experiments spanning multiple model architectures and parameter scales, we evaluate various document selection methods and adversarial training techniques across diverse datasets. Our extensive experiments consistently demonstrate that as models become more powerful, the performance gains brought by complex robust training methods drop off dramatically. We delve into the rationale and find that more powerful models inherently exhibit superior confidence calibration, better generalization across datasets (even when trained with randomly selected documents), and optimal attention mechanisms learned with simpler strategies. Our findings suggest that RAG systems can benefit from simpler architectures and training strategies as models become more powerful, enabling more scalable applications with minimal complexity.</p></details> |  |
| **[FunnelRAG: A Coarse-to-Fine Progressive Retrieval Paradigm for RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10293v3)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) prevails in Large Language Models. It mainly consists of retrieval and generation. The retrieval modules (a.k.a. retrievers) aim to find useful information used to facilitate the generation modules (a.k.a. generators). As such, generators' performance largely depends on the effectiveness and efficiency of retrievers. However, the widely used retrieval paradigm remains flat. It treats retrieval procedures as a one-off deal with constant granularity. Despite effectiveness, we argue that they suffer from two limitations: (1) flat retrieval exerts a significant burden on one retriever; (2) constant granularity limits the ceiling of retrieval performance. In this work, we propose a progressive retrieval paradigm with coarse-to-fine granularity for RAG, termed FunnelRAG, so as to balance effectiveness and efficiency. Specifically, FunnelRAG establishes a progressive retrieval pipeline by collaborating coarse-to-fine granularity, large-to-small quantity, and low-to-high capacity, which can relieve the burden on one retriever and also promote the ceiling of retrieval performance. Extensive experiments manifest that FunnelRAG achieves comparable retrieval performance while the time overhead is reduced by nearly 40 percent.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 6 figures, 13 tables.

For structured data, such as knowledge graphs, GraphRAG has been widely used to retrieve relevant information. However, recent studies have revealed that structuring implicit knowledge from text into graphs can benefit certain tasks, extending the application of GraphRAG from graph data to general text-based data. Despite their successful extensions, most applications of GraphRAG for text data have been designed for specific tasks and datasets, lacking a systematic evaluation and comparison between RAG and GraphRAG on widely used text-based benchmarks. In this paper, we systematically evaluate RAG and GraphRAG on well-established benchmark tasks, such as Question Answering and Query-based Summarization. Our results highlight the distinct strengths of RAG and GraphRAG across different tasks and evaluation perspectives. Inspired by these observations, we investigate strategies to integrate their strengths to improve downstream tasks. Additionally, we provide an in-depth discussion of the shortcomings of current GraphRAG approaches and outline directions for future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Investigating Language Preference of Multilingual RAG Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11175v1)** | 2025-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multilingual Retrieval-Augmented Generation (mRAG) systems enhance language models by integrating external multilingual information to produce context-aware responses. However, mRAG systems struggle with retrieving relevant information due to linguistic variations between queries and documents, generating inconsistent responses when multilingual sources conflict. In this work, we systematically investigate language preferences in both retrieval and generation of mRAG through a series of experiments. Our analysis indicates that retrievers tend to prefer high-resource and query languages, yet this preference does not consistently improve generation performance. Moreover, we observe that generators prefer the query language or Latin scripts, leading to inconsistent outputs. To overcome these issues, we propose Dual Knowledge Multilingual RAG (DKM-RAG), a simple yet effective framework that fuses translated multilingual passages with complementary model knowledge. Empirical results demonstrate that DKM-RAG mitigates language preference in generation and enhances performance across diverse linguistic settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 16 tables, 14 figures</p></details> |

These two capabilities are complementary to each other and essential for LLMs to process large volumes of information that cannot fit into a single prompt. We present a detailed continued training recipe to extend the context window of Llama3-70B-base from 8K to 128K tokens, along with a three-stage instruction tuning process to enhance the model's instruction-following, RAG performance, and long-context understanding capabilities. Our results demonstrate that the Llama3-ChatQA-2-70B model outperforms most existing state-of-the-art models, including GPT-4-Turbo-2024-04-09, Qwen2-72B-Instruct, and Llama3.1-70B-Instruct, on ultra-long tasks beyond 100K tokens, as well as on the RAG benchmark using only a 4K context window, showing the strong long context capability across varying sequence lengths. We further provide extensive comparisons between direct long-context and RAG solutions using the same state-of-the-art long-context LLMs. Interestingly, we find that the performance of strong long-context LLMs using RAG improves when retrieving a larger number of chunks. With a large set of top-k chunks, RAG consistently outperforms direct long-context solution using the same state-of-the-art long-context models (e.g., Llama3-ChatQA-2-70B and Qwen2-72B-Instruct) on both 32K and 128K benchmarks.

RAG integrates external knowledge to enhance factual consistency in generative outputs, while LoRA enables parameter-efficient fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs). DoRA further refines this process by optimizing fine-tuning through adaptive parameter ranking and domain-aware weight adjustments, improving learning efficiency while maintaining inference performance. This paper presents a large-scale empirical evaluation of RAG, LoRA, and DoRA, with model fine-tuning and generation performance assessed on 20,000 FAQ-based queries, while the knowledge base spans 400,000 entries. The study analyzes key performance metrics such as accuracy, relevance, and inference latency. Experimental results demonstrate that DoRA achieves the highest accuracy (90.1%), relevance score (0.88), and lowest latency (110 ms per query), outperforming both LoRA and RAG in real-world, domain-specific generative AI applications. Furthermore, this study examines the trade-offs between fine-tuning efficiency, computational cost, and real-time adaptability across different models. Findings highlight RAG's effectiveness in knowledge grounding, LoRA's cost-efficient domain adaptation, and DoRA's ability to balance fine-tuning efficiency with model precision. These insights provide practical guidance for deploying AI-driven generative systems in accuracy-critical domains such as healthcare, finance, and legal services, ensuring scalability, reliability, and optimal performance in dynamic environments.</p></details> | 10 Pages |

To overcome these limitations, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) incorporates up-to-date external information into LLMs without extensive fine-tuning. Meanwhile, small language models (SLMs) deployed on edge devices offer efficiency and low latency but often struggle with complex reasoning tasks. Unfortunately, current RAG approaches are predominantly based on centralized databases and have not been adapted to address the distinct constraints associated with deploying SLMs in edge environments. To bridge this gap, we propose Edge-Assisted and Collaborative RAG (EACO-RAG), a lightweight framework that leverages distributed edge nodes for adaptive knowledge updates and retrieval. EACO-RAG also employs a hierarchical collaborative gating mechanism to dynamically select among local, edge-assisted, and cloud-based strategies, with a carefully designed algorithm based on Safe Online Bayesian Optimization to maximize the potential performance enhancements. Experimental results demonstrate that EACO-RAG matches the accuracy of cloud-based knowledge graph RAG systems while reducing total costs by up to 84.6% under relaxed delay constraints and by 65.3% under stricter delay requirements. This work represents our initial effort toward achieving a distributed and scalable tiered LLM deployments, with EACO-RAG serving as a promising first step in unlocking the full potential of hybrid edge-cloud intelligence.</p></details> |  |
| **[KET-RAG: A Cost-Efficient Multi-Granular Indexing Framework for Graph-RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09304v1)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph-RAG constructs a knowledge graph from text chunks to improve retrieval in Large Language Model (LLM)-based question answering. It is particularly useful in domains such as biomedicine, law, and political science, where retrieval often requires multi-hop reasoning over proprietary documents. Some existing Graph-RAG systems construct KNN graphs based on text chunk relevance, but this coarse-grained approach fails to capture entity relationships within texts, leading to sub-par retrieval and generation quality. To address this, recent solutions leverage LLMs to extract entities and relationships from text chunks, constructing triplet-based knowledge graphs. However, this approach incurs significant indexing costs, especially for large document collections. To ensure a good result accuracy while reducing the indexing cost, we propose KET-RAG, a multi-granular indexing framework. KET-RAG first identifies a small set of key text chunks and leverages an LLM to construct a knowledge graph skeleton. It then builds a text-keyword bipartite graph from all text chunks, serving as a lightweight alternative to a full knowledge graph. During retrieval, KET-RAG searches both structures: it follows the local search strategy of existing Graph-RAG systems on the skeleton while mimicking this search on the bipartite graph to improve retrieval quality. We evaluate eight solutions on two real-world datasets, demonstrating that KET-RAG outperforms all competitors in indexing cost, retrieval effectiveness, and generation quality. Notably, it achieves comparable or superior retrieval quality to Microsoft's Graph-RAG while reducing indexing costs by over an order of magnitude. Additionally, it improves the generation quality by up to 32.4% while lowering indexing costs by around 20%.</p></details> |  |

However, RAG still struggles to fully prevent hallucinated responses. To address this, it is essential to identify samples prone to hallucination or guide LLMs toward correct responses, which experts then annotate to develop high-quality datasets for refining LLMs. However, the growing scarcity of such datasets makes their creation challenging. This paper proposes using the vast amount of conversations from widespread LLM usage to build these datasets, training LLMs to avoid hallucination-prone questions while accurately responding to manageable ones. Given the impracticality of expert-annotating all conversation records, the paper introduces AL4RAG, which uses active learning to select the most suitable conversation samples for annotation, optimizing performance within an annotation budget. Additionally, recognizing that traditional active learning methods are not fully compatible with RAG due to unsuitable distance metrics, we develop a novel sample distance measurement for RAG active learning. Extensive experiments show that our method consistently outperforms baselines across multiple metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Better RAG using Relevant Information Gain](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12101v2)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A common way to extend the memory of large language models (LLMs) is by retrieval augmented generation (RAG), which inserts text retrieved from a larger memory into an LLM's context window. However, the context window is typically limited to several thousand tokens, which limits the number of retrieved passages that can inform a model's response. For this reason, it's important to avoid occupying context window space with redundant information by ensuring a degree of diversity among retrieved passages. At the same time, the information should also be relevant to the current task. Most prior methods that encourage diversity among retrieved results, such as Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR), do so by incorporating an objective that explicitly trades off diversity and relevance. We propose a novel simple optimization metric based on relevant information gain, a probabilistic measure of the total information relevant to a query for a set of retrieved results. By optimizing this metric, diversity organically emerges from our system. When used as a drop-in replacement for the retrieval component of a RAG system, this method yields state-of-the-art performance on question answering tasks from the Retrieval Augmented Generation Benchmark (RGB), outperforming existing metrics that directly optimize for relevance and diversity.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 page paper submitted to EMNLP</p></details> |

While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) partially addresses these issues, its reliance on pure semantic similarity limits its effectiveness in educational contexts where conceptual relationships are crucial. This paper introduces Knowledge Graph-enhanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (KG-RAG), a novel framework that integrates structured knowledge representation with context-aware retrieval to enable more effective AI tutoring. We present three key contributions: (1) a novel architecture that grounds AI responses in structured domain knowledge, (2) empirical validation through controlled experiments (n=76) demonstrating significant learning improvements (35% increase in assessment scores, p<0.001), and (3) a comprehensive implementation framework addressing practical deployment considerations.

Traditionally, the task of crafting these competency questions heavily relies on the effort of domain experts and knowledge engineers which is often time-consuming and labor-intensive. With the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs), there arises the possibility to automate and enhance this process. Unlike other similar works which use existing ontologies or knowledge graphs as input to LLMs, we present a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approach that uses LLMs for the automatic generation of CQs given a set of scientific papers considered to be a domain knowledge base. We investigate its performance and specifically, we study the impact of different number of papers to the RAG and different temperature setting of the LLM. We conduct experiments using GPT-4 on two domain ontology engineering tasks and compare results against ground-truth CQs constructed by domain experts. Empirical assessments on the results, utilizing evaluation metrics (precision and consistency), reveal that compared to zero-shot prompting, adding relevant domain knowledge to the RAG improves the performance of LLMs on generating CQs for concrete ontology engineering tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, traditional RAG-based tool retrieval fails to capture structured dependencies between tools, limiting the retrieval accuracy of a retrieved tool's dependencies. For example, among a vector database of tools, a "get stock price" API requires a "stock ticker" parameter from a "get stock ticker" API, and both depend on OS-level internet connectivity tools. In this paper, we address this limitation by introducing Graph RAG-Tool Fusion, a novel plug-and-play approach that combines the strengths of vector-based retrieval with efficient graph traversal to capture all relevant tools (nodes) along with any nested dependencies (edges) within the predefined tool knowledge graph. We also present ToolLinkOS, a new tool selection benchmark of 573 fictional tools, spanning over 15 industries, each with an average of 6.3 tool dependencies. We demonstrate that Graph RAG-Tool Fusion achieves absolute improvements of 71.7% and 22.1% over na\"ive RAG on ToolLinkOS and ToolSandbox benchmarks, respectively (mAP@10).

While language models show promise in this context, their probabilistic nature complicates truthfulness and comprehensibility. This paper examines state-of-the-art Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enhanced with alignment techniques to fulfill GDPR obligations. We evaluate RAG systems incorporating an alignment module like Rewindable Auto-regressive Inference (RAIN) and our proposed multidimensional extension, MultiRAIN, using a Privacy Q&A dataset. Responses are optimized for preciseness and comprehensibility and are assessed through 21 metrics, including deterministic and large language model-based evaluations. Our results show that RAG systems with an alignment module outperform baseline RAG systems on most metrics, though none fully match human answers. Principal component analysis of the results reveals complex interactions between metrics, highlighting the need to refine metrics. This study provides a foundation for integrating advanced natural language processing systems into legal compliance frameworks.</p></details> | Submitted to ARR |

Currently, the most popular methods in literature consists of fine-tuning the model on written mathematical content such as academic publications and textbooks, so that the model can learn to emulate the style of mathematical writing. In this project, we explore the effectiveness of using retrieval augmented generation (RAG) to address gaps in the mathematical reasoning of LLMs. We develop LemmaHead, a RAG knowledge base that supplements queries to the model with relevant mathematical context, with particular focus on context from published textbooks. To measure our model's performance in mathematical reasoning, our testing paradigm focuses on the task of automated theorem proving via generating proofs to a given mathematical claim in the Lean formal language.</p></details> |  |

Through systematic empirical evaluation of three different LLM variants across multiple parameter configurations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our testing methodology in assessing both functional correctness and extra-functional properties. Our framework implements 17 distinct metrics that encompass syntactic analysis, semantic evaluation, and behavioral evaluation through LLM judges. The study reveals significant information about how different architectural choices and parameter configurations affect system performance, particularly highlighting the impact of temperature and top-p parameters on response quality. The tests were carried out on a tourism recommendation system for the V\"armland region, utilizing standard and RAG-enhanced configurations. The results indicate that the newer LLM versions show modest improvements in performance metrics, though the differences are more pronounced in response length and complexity rather than in semantic quality.

Typically, such RAG systems retrieve search results, download HTML sources of the results, and then extract plain texts from the HTML sources. Plain text documents or chunks are fed into the LLMs to augment the generation. However, much of the structural and semantic information inherent in HTML, such as headings and table structures, is lost during this plain-text-based RAG process. To alleviate this problem, we propose HtmlRAG, which uses HTML instead of plain text as the format of retrieved knowledge in RAG. We believe HTML is better than plain text in modeling knowledge in external documents, and most LLMs possess robust capacities to understand HTML. However, utilizing HTML presents new challenges. HTML contains additional content such as tags, JavaScript, and CSS specifications, which bring extra input tokens and noise to the RAG system. To address this issue, we propose HTML cleaning, compression, and a two-step block-tree-based pruning strategy, to shorten the HTML while minimizing the loss of information. Experiments on six QA datasets confirm the superiority of using HTML in RAG systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by WWW 2025 main conference.

| **[Enhancing Health Information Retrieval with RAG by Prioritizing Topical Relevance and Factual Accuracy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04666v1)** | 2025-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The exponential surge in online health information, coupled with its increasing use by non-experts, highlights the pressing need for advanced Health Information Retrieval models that consider not only topical relevance but also the factual accuracy of the retrieved information, given the potential risks associated with health misinformation. To this aim, this paper introduces a solution driven by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which leverages the capabilities of generative Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance the retrieval of health-related documents grounded in scientific evidence. In particular, we propose a three-stage model: in the first stage, the user's query is employed to retrieve topically relevant passages with associated references from a knowledge base constituted by scientific literature. In the second stage, these passages, alongside the initial query, are processed by LLMs to generate a contextually relevant rich text (GenText). In the last stage, the documents to be retrieved are evaluated and ranked both from the point of view of topical relevance and factual accuracy by means of their comparison with GenText, either through stance detection or semantic similarity. In addition to calculating factual accuracy, GenText can offer a layer of explainability for it, aiding users in understanding the reasoning behind the retrieval. Experimental evaluation of our model on benchmark datasets and against baseline models demonstrates its effectiveness in enhancing the retrieval of both topically relevant and factually accurate health information, thus presenting a significant step forward in the health misinformation mitigation problem.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Online Learning Efficiency Through Heterogeneous Resource Integration with a Multi-Agent RAG System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03948v1)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient online learning requires seamless access to diverse resources such as videos, code repositories, documentation, and general web content. This poster paper introduces early-stage work on a Multi-Agent Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System designed to enhance learning efficiency by integrating these heterogeneous resources. Using specialized agents tailored for specific resource types (e.g., YouTube tutorials, GitHub repositories, documentation websites, and search engines), the system automates the retrieval and synthesis of relevant information. By streamlining the process of finding and combining knowledge, this approach reduces manual effort and enhances the learning experience. A preliminary user study confirmed the system's strong usability and moderate-high utility, demonstrating its potential to improve the efficiency of knowledge acquisition.</p></details> |  |

While existing approaches such as ReAct maintain reasoning chains within the language model's context window, we observe that this often leads to plan fragmentation and execution failures. Our key insight is that by isolating the reasoning plan as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) outside the LM's working memory, we can enable (1) systematic exploration of reasoning paths, (2) atomic subqueries enabling precise retrievals and grounding, and (3) efficiency through parallel execution and bounded context window utilization. Moreover, Plan*RAG's modular design allows it to be integrated with existing RAG methods, thus providing a practical solution to improve current RAG systems. On standard multi-hop reasoning benchmarks, Plan*RAG consistently achieves improvements over recently proposed methods such as RQ-RAG and Self-RAG, while maintaining comparable computational costs.</p></details> | 19 pages, preprint |

Despite recent advancements, autonomous web agents still lack crucial self-improvement capabilities, struggling with procedural knowledge abstraction, refining skills, and skill composition. In this work, we introduce SkillWeaver, a skill-centric framework enabling agents to self-improve by autonomously synthesizing reusable skills as APIs. Given a new website, the agent autonomously discovers skills, executes them for practice, and distills practice experiences into robust APIs. Iterative exploration continually expands a library of lightweight, plug-and-play APIs, significantly enhancing the agent's capabilities. Experiments on WebArena and real-world websites demonstrate the efficacy of SkillWeaver, achieving relative success rate improvements of 31.8% and 39.8%, respectively. Additionally, APIs synthesized by strong agents substantially enhance weaker agents through transferable skills, yielding improvements of up to 54.3% on WebArena. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of honing diverse website interactions into APIs, which can be seamlessly shared among various web agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Unified Agentic Framework for Evaluating Conditional Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07046v1)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conditional image generation has gained significant attention for its ability to personalize content. However, the field faces challenges in developing task-agnostic, reliable, and explainable evaluation metrics. This paper introduces CIGEval, a unified agentic framework for comprehensive evaluation of conditional image generation tasks. CIGEval utilizes large multimodal models (LMMs) as its core, integrating a multi-functional toolbox and establishing a fine-grained evaluation framework. Additionally, we synthesize evaluation trajectories for fine-tuning, empowering smaller LMMs to autonomously select appropriate tools and conduct nuanced analyses based on tool outputs. Experiments across seven prominent conditional image generation tasks demonstrate that CIGEval (GPT-4o version) achieves a high correlation of 0.4625 with human assessments, closely matching the inter-annotator correlation of 0.47. Moreover, when implemented with 7B open-source LMMs using only 2.3K training trajectories, CIGEval surpasses the previous GPT-4o-based state-of-the-art method. Case studies on GPT-4o image generation highlight CIGEval's capability in identifying subtle issues related to subject consistency and adherence to control guidance, indicating its great potential for automating evaluation of image generation tasks with human-level reliability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Work ...</summary><p>Work in progress.

| **[Approximate Feedback Nash Equilibria with Sparse Inter-Agent Dependencies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16441v2)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Feedback Nash equilibrium strategies in multi-agent dynamic games require availability of all players' state information to compute control actions. However, in real-world scenarios, sensing and communication limitations between agents make full state feedback expensive or impractical, and such strategies can become fragile when state information from other agents is inaccurate. To this end, we propose a regularized dynamic programming approach for finding sparse feedback policies that selectively depend on the states of a subset of agents in dynamic games. The proposed approach solves convex adaptive group Lasso problems to compute sparse policies approximating Nash equilibrium solutions. We prove the regularized solutions' asymptotic convergence to a neighborhood of Nash equilibrium policies in linear-quadratic (LQ) games. Further, we extend the proposed approach to general non-LQ games via an iterative algorithm. Simulation results in multi-robot interaction scenarios show that the proposed approach effectively computes feedback policies with varying sparsity levels. When agents have noisy observations of other agents' states, simulation results indicate that the proposed regularized policies consistently achieve lower costs than standard Nash equilibrium policies by up to 77% for all interacting agents whose costs are coupled with other agents' states.</p></details> |  |
| **[Review of Case-Based Reasoning for LLM Agents: Theoretical Foundations, Architectural Components, and Cognitive Integration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06943v1)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated impressive capabilities in various tasks. Still, they face limitations in tasks requiring specific, structured knowledge, flexibility, or accountable decision-making. While agents are capable of perceiving their environments, forming inferences, planning, and executing actions towards goals, they often face issues such as hallucinations and lack of contextual memory across interactions. This paper explores how Case-Based Reasoning (CBR), a strategy that solves new problems by referencing past experiences, can be integrated into LLM agent frameworks. This integration allows LLMs to leverage explicit knowledge, enhancing their effectiveness. We systematically review the theoretical foundations of these enhanced agents, identify critical framework components, and formulate a mathematical model for the CBR processes of case retrieval, adaptation, and learning. We also evaluate CBR-enhanced agents against other methods like Chain-of-Thought reasoning and standard Retrieval-Augmented Generation, analyzing their relative strengths. Moreover, we explore how leveraging CBR's cognitive dimensions (including self-reflection, introspection, and curiosity) via goal-driven autonomy mechanisms can further enhance the LLM agent capabilities. Contributing to the ongoing research on neuro-symbolic hybrid systems, this work posits CBR as a viable technique for enhancing the reasoning skills and cognitive aspects of autonomous LLM agents.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we present several alternative methods based on machine learning methods (LSTM, xLSTM, Transformer, XGBoost, and ConvLSTM) to predict the final consensus value based on directed networks (Erd\"os-Renyi, Watts-Strogatz, and Barab\'asi-Albert) and on the initial state. We highlight how different k-hop interactions affect the performance of the tested methods. This framework opens new avenues for analyzing multi-scale diffusion processes in large-scale, complex networks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Persona Dynamics: Unveiling the Impact of Personality Traits on Agents in Text-Based Games](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06868v1)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial agents are increasingly central to complex interactions and decision-making tasks, yet aligning their behaviors with desired human values remains an open challenge. In this work, we investigate how human-like personality traits influence agent behavior and performance within text-based interactive environments. We introduce PANDA: PersonalityAdapted Neural Decision Agents, a novel method for projecting human personality traits onto agents to guide their behavior. To induce personality in a text-based game agent, (i) we train a personality classifier to identify what personality type the agent's actions exhibit, and (ii) we integrate the personality profiles directly into the agent's policy-learning pipeline. By deploying agents embodying 16 distinct personality types across 25 text-based games and analyzing their trajectories, we demonstrate that an agent's action decisions can be guided toward specific personality profiles. Moreover, certain personality types, such as those characterized by higher levels of Openness, display marked advantages in performance. These findings underscore the promise of personality-adapted agents for fostering more aligned, effective, and human-centric decision-making in interactive environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Inducing Programmatic Skills for Agentic Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06821v1)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To succeed in common digital tasks such as web navigation, agents must carry out a variety of specialized tasks such as searching for products or planning a travel route. To tackle these tasks, agents can bootstrap themselves by learning task-specific skills online through interaction with the web environment. In this work, we demonstrate that programs are an effective representation for skills. We propose agent skill induction (ASI), which allows agents to adapt themselves by inducing, verifying, and utilizing program-based skills on the fly. We start with an evaluation on the WebArena agent benchmark and show that ASI outperforms the static baseline agent and its text-skill counterpart by 23.5% and 11.3% in success rate, mainly thanks to the programmatic verification guarantee during the induction phase. ASI also improves efficiency by reducing 10.7-15.3% of the steps over baselines, by composing primitive actions (e.g., click) into higher-level skills (e.g., search product). We then highlight the efficacy of ASI in remaining efficient and accurate under scaled-up web activities. Finally, we examine the generalizability of induced skills when transferring between websites, and find that ASI can effectively reuse common skills, while also updating incompatible skills to versatile website changes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic Residual Safe Reinforcement Learning for Multi-Agent Safety-Critical Scenarios Decision-Making](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06670v1)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In multi-agent safety-critical scenarios, traditional autonomous driving frameworks face significant challenges in balancing safety constraints and task performance. These frameworks struggle to quantify dynamic interaction risks in real-time and depend heavily on manual rules, resulting in low computational efficiency and conservative strategies. To address these limitations, we propose a Dynamic Residual Safe Reinforcement Learning (DRS-RL) framework grounded in a safety-enhanced networked Markov decision process. It's the first time that the weak-to-strong theory is introduced into multi-agent decision-making, enabling lightweight dynamic calibration of safety boundaries via a weak-to-strong safety correction paradigm. Based on the multi-agent dynamic conflict zone model, our framework accurately captures spatiotemporal coupling risks among heterogeneous traffic participants and surpasses the static constraints of conventional geometric rules. Moreover, a risk-aware prioritized experience replay mechanism mitigates data distribution bias by mapping risk to sampling probability. Experimental results reveal that the proposed method significantly outperforms traditional RL algorithms in safety, efficiency, and comfort. Specifically, it reduces the collision rate by up to 92.17%, while the safety model accounts for merely 27% of the main model's parameters.</p></details> |  |

However, existing approaches often overlook the role distinctions within distributed databases and rely on small-scale models with limited generalization capabilities. In this paper, we conduct a preliminary empirical study to emphasize the unique significance of different roles. Building on this insight, we propose AgentFM, a role-aware failure management framework for distributed databases powered by LLM-driven multi-agents. AgentFM addresses failure management by considering system roles, data roles, and task roles, with a meta-agent orchestrating these components. Preliminary evaluations using Apache IoTDB demonstrate the effectiveness of AgentFM and open new directions for further research.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by FSE-IVR'25</p></details> |

In this study, we analysed conversational data from three controlled experiments in which participants self-disclosed to a human, a humanoid social robot, and a disembodied conversational agent. Using sentence embeddings and clustering, we identified themes in participants' disclosures, which were then labelled and explained by a large language model. We subsequently assessed whether these themes and the underlying semantic structure of the disclosures varied by agent embodiment. Our findings reveal strong consistency: thematic distributions did not significantly differ across embodiments, and semantic similarity analyses showed that disclosures were expressed in highly comparable ways. These results suggest that while embodiment may influence human behaviour in human-robot and human-agent interactions, people tend to maintain a consistent thematic focus and semantic structure in their disclosures, whether speaking to humans or artificial interlocutors.</p></details> |  |

We introduce APIGen-MT, a two-phase framework that generates verifiable and diverse multi-turn agent data. In the first phase, our agentic pipeline produces detailed task blueprints with ground-truth actions, leveraging a committee of LLM reviewers and iterative feedback loops. These blueprints are then transformed into complete interaction trajectories through simulated human-agent interplay. We train a family of models -- the xLAM-2-fc-r series with sizes ranging from 1B to 70B parameters. Our models outperform frontier models such as GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 on $\tau$-bench and BFCL benchmarks, with the smaller models surpassing their larger counterparts, particularly in multi-turn settings, while maintaining superior consistency across multiple trials. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our verified blueprint-to-details approach yields high-quality training data, enabling the development of more reliable, efficient, and capable agents. We open-source both the synthetic data collected and the trained xLAM-2-fc-r models to advance research in AI agents.

However, these processes often require extensive expertise and manual effort, limiting their scalability. Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have shown promise in automating these tasks due to their increasing problem-solving abilities. To support the evaluation and development of such methods, we introduce GenoTEX, a benchmark dataset for the automated analysis of gene expression data. GenoTEX provides analysis code and results for solving a wide range of gene-trait association problems, encompassing dataset selection, preprocessing, and statistical analysis, in a pipeline that follows computational genomics standards. The benchmark includes expert-curated annotations from bioinformaticians to ensure accuracy and reliability. To provide baselines for these tasks, we present GenoAgent, a team of LLM-based agents that adopt a multi-step programming workflow with flexible self-correction, to collaboratively analyze gene expression datasets. Our experiments demonstrate the potential of LLM-based methods in analyzing genomic data, while error analysis highlights the challenges and areas for future improvement. We propose GenoTEX as a promising resource for benchmarking and enhancing automated methods for gene expression data analysis.

To address this, we introduce TxGemma, a suite of efficient, generalist large language models (LLMs) capable of therapeutic property prediction as well as interactive reasoning and explainability. Unlike task-specific models, TxGemma synthesizes information from diverse sources, enabling broad application across the therapeutic development pipeline. The suite includes 2B, 9B, and 27B parameter models, fine-tuned from Gemma-2 on a comprehensive dataset of small molecules, proteins, nucleic acids, diseases, and cell lines. Across 66 therapeutic development tasks, TxGemma achieved superior or comparable performance to the state-of-the-art generalist model on 64 (superior on 45), and against state-of-the-art specialist models on 50 (superior on 26). Fine-tuning TxGemma models on therapeutic downstream tasks, such as clinical trial adverse event prediction, requires less training data than fine-tuning base LLMs, making TxGemma suitable for data-limited applications. Beyond these predictive capabilities, TxGemma features conversational models that bridge the gap between general LLMs and specialized property predictors. These allow scientists to interact in natural language, provide mechanistic reasoning for predictions based on molecular structure, and engage in scientific discussions. Building on this, we further introduce Agentic-Tx, a generalist therapeutic agentic system powered by Gemini 2.5 that reasons, acts, manages diverse workflows, and acquires external domain knowledge. Agentic-Tx surpasses prior leading models on the Humanity's Last Exam benchmark (Chemistry & Biology) with 52.3% relative improvement over o3-mini (high) and 26.7% over o3-mini (high) on GPQA (Chemistry) and excels with improvements of 6.3% (ChemBench-Preference) and 2.4% (ChemBench-Mini) over o3-mini (high).</p></details> |  |

Here, we present SkillFlow, a modular, technology-agnostic framework that allows agents to expand their functionality in an ad-hoc fashion by acquiring new skills from their environment or other agents. We present a theoretical model that examines under which conditions this framework would be beneficial, and we then explore SkillFlow's ability to accelerate task completion and lead to lower cumulative costs in a real-world application, namely scheduling agents for calendar events. We demonstrate that within a few iterations, SkillFlow leads to considerable (24.8%, p-value = $6.4\times10^{-3}$) gains in time and cost, especially when the communication cost is high. Finally, we draw analogies from well-studied biological systems and compare this framework to that of lateral gene transfer, a significant process of adaptation and evolution in novel environments.</p></details> |  |

However, these approaches often require task-specific demonstrations or designing complex simulation environments, which limits the development of generalizable and robust policies for unseen real-world settings. Recent advances in the use of foundation models for robotics (e.g., LLMs, VLMs) have shown great potential in enabling systems to understand the semantics in the world from large-scale internet data. However, it remains an open challenge to use this knowledge to enable robotic systems to understand the underlying dynamics of the world, to generalize policies across different tasks, and to adapt policies to new environments. To alleviate these limitations, we propose an agentic framework for robot self-guidance and self-improvement, which consists of a set of role-specialized conversational agents, such as a high-level advisor, a grounding agent, a monitoring agent, and a robotic agent. Our framework iteratively grounds a base robot policy to relevant objects in the environment and uses visuomotor cues to shift the action distribution of the policy to more desirable states, online, while remaining agnostic to the subjective configuration of a given robot hardware platform. We demonstrate that our approach can effectively guide manipulation policies to achieve significantly higher success rates, both in simulation and in real-world experiments, without the need for additional human demonstrations or extensive exploration.

Previous research efforts have explored the capabilities of MARL algorithms within Hanabi, focusing largely on advanced architecture design and algorithmic manipulations to achieve state-of-the-art performance for a various number of cooperators. However, this often leads to complex solution strategies with high computational cost and requiring large amounts of training data. For humans to solve the Hanabi game effectively, they require the use of conventions, which often allows for a means to implicitly convey ideas or knowledge based on a predefined, and mutually agreed upon, set of ``rules''. Multi-agent problems containing partial observability, especially when limited communication is present, can benefit greatly from the use of implicit knowledge sharing. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to augmenting the action space using conventions, which act as special cooperative actions that span over multiple time steps and multiple agents, requiring agents to actively opt in for it to reach fruition. These conventions are based on existing human conventions, and result in a significant improvement on the performance of existing techniques for self-play and cross-play across a various number of cooperators within Hanabi.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is under review at the journal of autonomous agents and multi-agent systems (JAAMAS).

We present SHIMI (Semantic Hierarchical Memory Index), a unified architecture that models knowledge as a dynamically structured hierarchy of concepts, enabling agents to retrieve information based on meaning rather than surface similarity. SHIMI organizes memory into layered semantic nodes and supports top-down traversal from abstract intent to specific entities, offering more precise and explainable retrieval. Critically, SHIMI is natively designed for decentralized ecosystems, where agents maintain local memory trees and synchronize them asynchronously across networks. We introduce a lightweight sync protocol that leverages Merkle-DAG summaries, Bloom filters, and CRDT-style conflict resolution to enable partial synchronization with minimal overhead. Through benchmark experiments and use cases involving decentralized agent collaboration, we demonstrate SHIMI's advantages in retrieval accuracy, semantic fidelity, and scalability - positioning it as a core infrastructure layer for decentralized cognitive systems.</p></details> |  |

However, their reliance on closed-source or resource-intensive models introduces significant deployment challenges in private environments, prompting a critical question: \textit{How can personally deployable open-source LLMs achieve comparable code reasoning performance?} To this end, we propose a unified Test-Time Compute scaling framework that leverages increased inference-time computation instead of larger models. Our framework incorporates two complementary strategies: internal TTC and external TTC. Internally, we introduce a \textit{development-contextualized trajectory synthesis} method leveraging real-world software repositories to bootstrap multi-stage reasoning processes, such as fault localization and patch generation. We further enhance trajectory quality through rejection sampling, rigorously evaluating trajectories along accuracy and complexity. Externally, we propose a novel \textit{development-process-based search} strategy guided by reward models and execution verification. This approach enables targeted computational allocation at critical development decision points, overcoming limitations of existing "end-point only" verification methods.

| **[Rolling Horizon Coverage Control with Collaborative Autonomous Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05883v1)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work proposes a coverage controller that enables an aerial team of distributed autonomous agents to collaboratively generate non-myopic coverage plans over a rolling finite horizon, aiming to cover specific points on the surface area of a 3D object of interest. The collaborative coverage problem, formulated, as a distributed model predictive control problem, optimizes the agents' motion and camera control inputs, while considering inter-agent constraints aiming at reducing work redundancy. The proposed coverage controller integrates constraints based on light-path propagation techniques to predict the parts of the object's surface that are visible with regard to the agents' future anticipated states. This work also demonstrates how complex, non-linear visibility assessment constraints can be converted into logical expressions that are embedded as binary constraints into a mixed-integer optimization framework. The proposed approach has been demonstrated through simulations and practical applications for inspecting buildings with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).</p></details> |  |
| **[Agent Guide: A Simple Agent Behavioral Watermarking Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05871v1)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing deployment of intelligent agents in digital ecosystems, such as social media platforms, has raised significant concerns about traceability and accountability, particularly in cybersecurity and digital content protection. Traditional large language model (LLM) watermarking techniques, which rely on token-level manipulations, are ill-suited for agents due to the challenges of behavior tokenization and information loss during behavior-to-action translation. To address these issues, we propose Agent Guide, a novel behavioral watermarking framework that embeds watermarks by guiding the agent's high-level decisions (behavior) through probability biases, while preserving the naturalness of specific executions (action). Our approach decouples agent behavior into two levels, behavior (e.g., choosing to bookmark) and action (e.g., bookmarking with specific tags), and applies watermark-guided biases to the behavior probability distribution. We employ a z-statistic-based statistical analysis to detect the watermark, ensuring reliable extraction over multiple rounds. Experiments in a social media scenario with diverse agent profiles demonstrate that Agent Guide achieves effective watermark detection with a low false positive rate. Our framework provides a practical and robust solution for agent watermarking, with applications in identifying malicious agents and protecting proprietary agent systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Are Generative AI Agents Effective Personalized Financial Advisors?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05862v1)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model-based agents are becoming increasingly popular as a low-cost mechanism to provide personalized, conversational advice, and have demonstrated impressive capabilities in relatively simple scenarios, such as movie recommendations. But how do these agents perform in complex high-stakes domains, where domain expertise is essential and mistakes carry substantial risk? This paper investigates the effectiveness of LLM-advisors in the finance domain, focusing on three distinct challenges: (1) eliciting user preferences when users themselves may be unsure of their needs, (2) providing personalized guidance for diverse investment preferences, and (3) leveraging advisor personality to build relationships and foster trust. Via a lab-based user study with 64 participants, we show that LLM-advisors often match human advisor performance when eliciting preferences, although they can struggle to resolve conflicting user needs. When providing personalized advice, the LLM was able to positively influence user behavior, but demonstrated clear failure modes. Our results show that accurate preference elicitation is key, otherwise, the LLM-advisor has little impact, or can even direct the investor toward unsuitable assets. More worryingly, users appear insensitive to the quality of advice being given, or worse these can have an inverse relationship. Indeed, users reported a preference for and increased satisfaction as well as emotional trust with LLMs adopting an extroverted persona, even though those agents provided worse advice.</p></details> |  |
| **[Autono: A ReAct-Based Highly Robust Autonomous Agent Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04650v2)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a highly robust autonomous agent framework based on the ReAct paradigm, designed to solve complex tasks through adaptive decision making and multi-agent collaboration. Unlike traditional frameworks that rely on fixed workflows generated by LLM-based planners, this framework dynamically generates next actions during agent execution based on prior trajectories, thereby enhancing its robustness. To address potential termination issues caused by adaptive execution paths, I propose a timely abandonment strategy incorporating a probabilistic penalty mechanism. For multi-agent collaboration, I introduce a memory transfer mechanism that enables shared and dynamically updated memory among agents. The framework's innovative timely abandonment strategy dynamically adjusts the probability of task abandonment via probabilistic penalties, allowing developers to balance conservative and exploratory tendencies in agent execution strategies by tuning hyperparameters. This significantly improves adaptability and task execution efficiency in complex environments. Additionally, agents can be extended through external tool integration, supported by modular design and MCP protocol compatibility, which enables flexible action space expansion. Through explicit division of labor, the multi-agent collaboration mechanism enables agents to focus on specific task components, thereby significantly improving execution efficiency and quality.</p></details> | 10 pages, 3 figures |

Moreover, a range of crucial robotics-related tasks, such as multi-robot pathfinding, which have traditionally been approached with classical non-learnable methods (e.g., heuristic search), are now being suggested for solution using learning-based or hybrid methods. However, in this domain, it remains difficult, if not impossible, to conduct a fair comparison between classical, learning-based, and hybrid approaches due to the lack of a unified framework that supports both learning and evaluation. To address this, we introduce POGEMA, a comprehensive set of tools that includes a fast environment for learning, a problem instance generator, a collection of predefined problem instances, a visualization toolkit, and a benchmarking tool for automated evaluation. We also introduce and define an evaluation protocol that specifies a range of domain-related metrics, computed based on primary evaluation indicators (such as success rate and path length), enabling a fair multi-fold comparison. The results of this comparison, which involves a variety of state-of-the-art MARL, search-based, and hybrid methods, are presented.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at The International Conference on Learning Representations 2025</p></details> |

Solving MAPF optimally, even under restrictive assumptions, is NP-hard, yet efficient solutions for this problem are critical for numerous applications, such as automated warehouses and transportation systems. Recently, learning-based approaches to MAPF have gained attention, particularly those leveraging deep reinforcement learning. Typically, such learning-based MAPF solvers are augmented with additional components like single-agent planning or communication. Orthogonally, in this work we rely solely on imitation learning that leverages a large dataset of expert MAPF solutions and transformer-based neural network to create a foundation model for MAPF called MAPF-GPT. The latter is capable of generating actions without additional heuristics or communication. MAPF-GPT demonstrates zero-shot learning abilities when solving the MAPF problems that are not present in the training dataset. We show that MAPF-GPT notably outperforms the current best-performing learnable MAPF solvers on a diverse range of problem instances and is computationally efficient during inference.</p></details> |  |

Their performance depends on the underlying base agent. Existing methods, however, struggle with long-context reasoning and goal adherence. We introduce StateAct, a novel and efficient base agent that enhances decision-making through (1) self-prompting, which reinforces task goals at every step, and (2) chain-of-states, an extension of chain-of-thought that tracks state information over time. StateAct outperforms ReAct, the previous best base agent, by over 10% on Alfworld, 30% on Textcraft, and 7% on Webshop across multiple frontier LLMs. We also demonstrate that StateAct can be used as a drop-in replacement for ReAct with advanced LLM agent methods such as test-time scaling, yielding an additional 12% gain on Textcraft. By improving efficiency and long-range reasoning without requiring additional training or retrieval, StateAct provides a scalable foundation for LLM agents.

Traditional methods for evaluating reflections are time-consuming and may not scale effectively in educational settings. In this work, we employ LLMs to transform student reflections into quantitative scores using two assessment strategies (single-agent and multi-agent) and two prompting techniques (zero-shot and few-shot). Our experiments, conducted on a dataset of 5,278 reflections from 377 students over three academic terms, demonstrate that the single-agent with few-shot strategy achieves the highest match rate with human evaluations. Furthermore, models utilizing LLM-assessed reflection scores outperform baselines in both at-risk student identification and grade prediction tasks. These findings suggest that LLMs can effectively automate reflection assessment, reduce educators' workload, and enable timely support for students who may need additional assistance. Our work emphasizes the potential of integrating advanced generative AI technologies into educational practices to enhance student engagement and academic success.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in Proceedings of the 29th Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (PAKDD 2025)</p></details> |

Although traditional deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods have been shown to be promising, their effectiveness is hindered by a reliance on manually designed reward functions and inefficiencies in dynamic environments. In this paper, an inverse reinforcement learning (IRL)-based framework is proposed, in which multi-head self-attention (MHSA) and graph attention mechanisms are incorporated to enhance reward function learning and task execution efficiency. Expert demonstrations are utilized to infer optimal reward densities, allowing dependence on handcrafted designs to be reduced and adaptability to be improved. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of the proposed method over widely used multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms in terms of both cumulative rewards and task execution efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Added...</summary><p>Added a clarification on the source of expert trajectories in Section V</p></details> |

However, a persistent challenge lies in ensuring these models maintain high accuracy in answering questions while reliably recognizing unanswerable queries. Despite significant advances in large language models (LLMs) for reading comprehension, this issue remains critical, particularly as the length of supported contexts continues to expand. To address this challenge, we propose an innovative data augmentation methodology grounded in a multi-agent collaborative framework. Unlike traditional methods, such as the costly human annotation process required for datasets like SQuAD 2.0, our method autonomously generates evidence-based question-answer pairs and systematically constructs unanswerable questions. Using this methodology, we developed the FactGuard-Bench dataset, which comprises 25,220 examples of both answerable and unanswerable question scenarios, with context lengths ranging from 8K to 128K. Experimental evaluations conducted on seven popular LLMs reveal that even the most advanced models achieve only 61.79% overall accuracy. Furthermore, we emphasize the importance of a model's ability to reason about unanswerable questions to avoid generating plausible but incorrect answers. By implementing efficient data selection and generation within the multi-agent collaborative framework, our method significantly reduces the traditionally high costs associated with manual annotation and provides valuable insights for the training and optimization of LLMs.</p></details> |  |

The platform also defines ten categories of tools for agent-driven task solving and evaluates seven leading LLMs, revealing that while models like Claude-3.7-Sonnet can achieve a 67.1% task completion rate in routine settings, they still struggle with complex task understanding and tool coordination, limiting their capacity to serve as the central core of automated radiology systems. By incorporating four advanced prompt engineering strategies--where prompt-backpropagation and multi-agent collaboration contributed 16.8% and 30.7% improvements, respectively--the performance for complex tasks was enhanced by 48.2% overall. Furthermore, automated tool building was explored to improve robustness, achieving a 65.4% success rate, thereby offering promising insights for the future integration of fully automated radiology applications into clinical practice.

| **[Inverse Attention Agents for Multi-Agent Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21794v2)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A major challenge for Multi-Agent Systems is enabling agents to adapt dynamically to diverse environments in which opponents and teammates may continually change. Agents trained using conventional methods tend to excel only within the confines of their training cohorts; their performance drops significantly when confronting unfamiliar agents. To address this shortcoming, we introduce Inverse Attention Agents that adopt concepts from the Theory of Mind (ToM) implemented algorithmically using an attention mechanism trained in an end-to-end manner. Crucial to determining the final actions of these agents, the weights in their attention model explicitly represent attention to different goals. We furthermore propose an inverse attention network that deduces the ToM of agents based on observations and prior actions. The network infers the attentional states of other agents, thereby refining the attention weights to adjust the agent's final action. We conduct experiments in a continuous environment, tackling demanding tasks encompassing cooperation, competition, and a blend of both. They demonstrate that the inverse attention network successfully infers the attention of other agents, and that this information improves agent performance. Additional human experiments show that, compared to baseline agent models, our inverse attention agents exhibit superior cooperation with humans and better emulate human behaviors.</p></details> |  |

Still, limitations in their training prevent them from answering accurately in scenarios that could benefit from multiple perspectives. Multi-agent systems allow the resolution of questions to enhance result consistency and reliability. While drug-target interaction (DTI) prediction is important for drug discovery, existing approaches face challenges due to complex biological systems and the lack of interpretability needed for clinical applications. DrugAgent is a multi-agent LLM system for DTI prediction that combines multiple specialized perspectives with transparent reasoning. Our system adapts and extends existing multi-agent frameworks by (1) applying coordinator-based architecture to the DTI domain, (2) integrating domain-specific data sources, including ML predictions, knowledge graphs, and literature evidence, and (3) incorporating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and ReAct (Reason+Act) frameworks for transparent DTI reasoning. We conducted comprehensive experiments using a kinase inhibitor dataset, where our multi-agent LLM method outperformed the non-reasoning multi-agent model (GPT-4o mini) by 45% in F1 score (0.514 vs 0.355). Through ablation studies, we demonstrated the contributions of each agent, with the AI agent being the most impactful, followed by the KG agent and search agent. Most importantly, our approach provides detailed, human-interpretable reasoning for each prediction by combining evidence from multiple sources - a critical feature for biomedical applications where understanding the rationale behind predictions is essential for clinical decision-making and regulatory compliance.

The original paper studied the relationship between the number of agents needed to solve the problem and the edge density of the graph. The paper presented strong evidence that edge density of a graph, or the number of redundant edges within the graph, may be the correct graph property to accurately differentiate whether $k= o(n)$ agents (low edge density) or $k = \Omega(n)$ agents (high edge density) are needed to solve the problem. In this paper, we show that surprisingly, edge density may not in fact be the correct differentiating property. The original paper presents graphs with edge density $1.1\overline{6}$ that require $\Omega(n)$ agents, however, we construct graphs with edge density $> 1.1\overline{6}$ and develop an algorithm to solve the problem on those graphs using only $o(n)$ agents. We subsequently show that the relationship between edge density and number of agents is fairly weak by first constructing graphs with edge density tending to $1$ from above that require $\Omega(n/f(n))$ agents to solve, for any function $f(n) \to \infty$ as $n \to \infty$. We then construct an infinite family of graphs with edge density $< \rho$ requiring exactly $k$ ignorant agents to solve \textsc{Broadcast}, for any $k>0$ and $\rho>1$.</p></details> | 18 pages, 2 figures |

Most explainable reinforcement learning (XRL) methods generate a static explanation depicting their developers' intuition of what should be explained and how. In contrast, literature from the social sciences proposes that meaningful explanations are structured as a dialog between the explainer and the explainee, suggesting a more active role for the user and her communication with the agent. In this paper, we present ASQ-IT -- an interactive explanation system that presents video clips of the agent acting in its environment based on queries given by the user that describe temporal properties of behaviors of interest. Our approach is based on formal methods: queries in ASQ-IT's user interface map to a fragment of Linear Temporal Logic over finite traces (LTLf), which we developed, and our algorithm for query processing is based on automata theory. User studies show that end-users can understand and formulate queries in ASQ-IT and that using ASQ-IT assists users in identifying faulty agent behaviors.</p></details> |  |

Unlike conventional editing tasks that rely on direct prompt-based modifications, creative image editing demands an autonomous, iterative approach that balances originality, coherence, and artistic intent. To address this, we introduce CREA, a novel multi-agent collaborative framework that mimics the human creative process. Our framework leverages a team of specialized AI agents who dynamically collaborate to conceptualize, generate, critique, and enhance images. Through extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations, we demonstrate that CREA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in diversity, semantic alignment, and creative transformation. By structuring creativity as a dynamic, agentic process, CREA redefines the intersection of AI and art, paving the way for autonomous AI-driven artistic exploration, generative design, and human-AI co-creation.

A promising application lies in the automatic generalization of instructional design for curriculum and learning activities, focusing on two key aspects: (1) Customized Generation: generating niche-targeted teaching content based on students' varying learning abilities and states, and (2) Intelligent Optimization: iteratively optimizing content based on feedback from learning effectiveness or test scores. Currently, a single large LLM cannot effectively manage the entire process, posing a challenge for designing intelligent teaching plans. To address these issues, we developed EduPlanner, an LLM-based multi-agent system comprising an evaluator agent, an optimizer agent, and a question analyst, working in adversarial collaboration to generate customized and intelligent instructional design for curriculum and learning activities. Taking mathematics lessons as our example, EduPlanner employs a novel Skill-Tree structure to accurately model the background mathematics knowledge of student groups, personalizing instructional design for curriculum and learning activities according to students' knowledge levels and learning abilities. Additionally, we introduce the CIDDP, an LLM-based five-dimensional evaluation module encompassing clarity, Integrity, Depth, Practicality, and Pertinence, to comprehensively assess mathematics lesson plan quality and bootstrap intelligent optimization. Experiments conducted on the GSM8K and Algebra datasets demonstrate that EduPlanner excels in evaluating and optimizing instructional design for curriculum and learning activities. Ablation studies further validate the significance and effectiveness of each component within the framework. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/Zc0812/Edu_Planner</p></details> |  |

A trajectory from today to superintelligence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05259v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As LLM agents grow more capable of causing harm autonomously, AI developers will rely on increasingly sophisticated control measures to prevent possibly misaligned agents from causing harm. AI developers could demonstrate that their control measures are sufficient by running control evaluations: testing exercises in which a red team produces agents that try to subvert control measures. To ensure control evaluations accurately capture misalignment risks, the affordances granted to this red team should be adapted to the capability profiles of the agents to be deployed under control measures. In this paper we propose a systematic framework for adapting affordances of red teams to advancing AI capabilities. Rather than assuming that agents will always execute the best attack strategies known to humans, we demonstrate how knowledge of an agents's actual capability profile can inform proportional control evaluations, resulting in more practical and cost-effective control measures. We illustrate our framework by considering a sequence of five fictional models (M1-M5) with progressively advanced capabilities, defining five distinct AI control levels (ACLs). For each ACL, we provide example rules for control evaluation, control measures, and safety cases that could be appropriate. Finally, we show why constructing a compelling AI control safety case for superintelligent LLM agents will require research breakthroughs, highlighting that we might eventually need alternative approaches to mitigating misalignment risk.</p></details> |  |

To address this challenge, we introduce an LLM-based agentic AI system that integrates contextual retrieval, fine-tuning, and multi-step reasoning to extract relevant financial data, classify investments, and ensure compliance with funding guidelines. Our study focuses on a real-world application: tracking EWS investments in the Climate Risk and Early Warning Systems (CREWS) Fund. We analyze 25 MDB project documents and evaluate multiple AI-driven classification methods, including zero-shot and few-shot learning, fine-tuned transformer-based classifiers, chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, and an agent-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approach. Our results show that the agent-based RAG approach significantly outperforms other methods, achieving 87\% accuracy, 89\% precision, and 83\% recall.

Existing approaches primarily rely on RGB images for environmental representation, underutilizing latent textual semantic and spatial cues and leaving the modality gap between instructions and scarce environmental representations unresolved. Intuitively, humans inherently ground semantic knowledge within spatial layouts during indoor navigation. Inspired by this, we propose a versatile Semantic Understanding and Spatial Awareness (SUSA) architecture to encourage agents to ground environment from diverse perspectives. SUSA includes a Textual Semantic Understanding (TSU) module, which narrows the modality gap between instructions and environments by generating and associating the descriptions of environmental landmarks in agent's immediate surroundings. Additionally, a Depth-enhanced Spatial Perception (DSP) module incrementally constructs a depth exploration map, enabling a more nuanced comprehension of environmental layouts. Experiments demonstrate that SUSA's hybrid semantic-spatial representations effectively enhance navigation performance, setting new state-of-the-art performance across three VLN benchmarks (REVERIE, R2R, and SOON).

In this paper, we present an approach that builds a CNN-based colony of AI agents to serve as a single system and perform multiple tasks (e.g., predictions or classifications) in an environment. The proposed system impersonates the natural environment of a biological system, like an ant colony or a human colony. The proposed colony of AI that is defined as a role-based system uniquely contributes to accomplish tasks in an environment by incorporating AI agents that are fast learners, detailed learners, and organized learners. These learners can enhance their localized learning and their collective decisions as a single system of colony of AI agents. This approach also enhances the diversity and quality of the colony of AI with the help of Genetic Algorithms and their crossover and mutation mechanisms. The evolution of fast, detailed, and organized learners in the colony of AI is achieved by introducing a unique one-to-one mapping between these learners and the pretrained VGG16, VGG19, and ResNet50 models, respectively. This role-based approach creates two parent-AI agents using the AI models through the processes, called the intra- and inter-marriage of AI, so that they can share their learned knowledge (weights and biases) based on a probabilistic rule and produce diversified child-AI agents to perform new tasks. This process will form a colony of AI that consists of families of multi-model and mixture-model AI agents to improve diversity and quality. Simulations show that the colony of AI, built using the VGG16, VGG19, and ResNet50 models, can provide a single system that generates child-AI agents of excellent predictive performance, ranging between 82% and 95% of F1-scores, to make diversified collective and quality decisions on a task.</p></details> | 12 pages, 8 figures |

It has recently been shown that this problem can be efficiently solved through the notion of Control Barrier Functions (CBFs). However, for nonholonomic vehicles that are required to keep positive speeds, existing CBFs lose their validity. To overcome this limitation, we propose a hybrid formulation based on synergistic CBFs (SCBFs), which leverages a discrete switching mechanism to avoid configurations that would render the CBF invalid. Unlike existing approaches, our method ensures safety in the presence of moving obstacles and inter-agent interactions while respecting nonzero speed restrictions.

However, their autonomy introduces safety risks, including security vulnerabilities, legal violations, and unintended harmful actions. Existing mitigation methods, such as model-based safeguards and early enforcement strategies, fall short in robustness, interpretability, and adaptability. To address these challenges, we propose AgentSpec, a lightweight domain-specific language for specifying and enforcing runtime constraints on LLM agents. With AgentSpec, users define structured rules that incorporate triggers, predicates, and enforcement mechanisms, ensuring agents operate within predefined safety boundaries. We implement AgentSpec across multiple domains, including code execution, embodied agents, and autonomous driving, demonstrating its adaptability and effectiveness. Our evaluation shows that AgentSpec successfully prevents unsafe executions in over 90% of code agent cases, eliminates all hazardous actions in embodied agent tasks, and enforces 100% compliance by autonomous vehicles (AVs). Despite its strong safety guarantees, AgentSpec remains computationally lightweight, with overheads in milliseconds. By combining interpretability, modularity, and efficiency, AgentSpec provides a practical and scalable solution for enforcing LLM agent safety across diverse applications. We also automate the generation of rules using LLMs and assess their effectiveness. Our evaluation shows that the rules generated by OpenAI o1 achieve a precision of 95.56% and recall of 70.96% for embodied agents, successfully identifying 87.26% of the risky code, and prevent AVs from breaking laws in 5 out of 8 scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Debate-Feedback: A Multi-Agent Framework for Efficient Legal Judgment Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05358v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The use of AI in legal analysis and prediction (LegalAI) has gained widespread attention, with past research focusing on retrieval-based methods and fine-tuning large models. However, these approaches often require large datasets and underutilize the capabilities of modern large language models (LLMs). In this paper, inspired by the debate phase of real courtroom trials, we propose a novel legal judgment prediction model based on the Debate-Feedback architecture, which integrates LLM multi-agent debate and reliability evaluation models. Unlike traditional methods, our model achieves significant improvements in efficiency by minimizing the need for large historical datasets, thus offering a lightweight yet robust solution. Comparative experiments show that it outperforms several general-purpose and domain-specific legal models, offering a dynamic reasoning process and a promising direction for future LegalAI research.</p></details> |  |

To date, the development of communication strategies that promote meat reduction while minimizing social costs has required the costly involvement of human participants at each stage of the process. We present work in progress on simulating multi-round dialogues on meat reduction between Generative Agents based on large language models (LLMs). We measure our main outcome using established psychological questionnaires based on the Theory of Planned Behavior and additionally investigate Social Costs. We find evidence that our preliminary simulations produce outcomes that are (i) consistent with theoretical expectations; and (ii) valid when compared to data from previous studies with human participants. Generative agent-based models are a promising tool for identifying novel communication strategies on meat reduction-tailored to highly specific participant groups-to then be tested in subsequent studies with human participants.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available at https://github.com/dess-mannheim/MeatlessAgents</p></details> |
| **[BIASINSPECTOR: Detecting Bias in Structured Data through LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04855v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting biases in structured data is a complex and time-consuming task. Existing automated techniques are limited in diversity of data types and heavily reliant on human case-by-case handling, resulting in a lack of generalizability. Currently, large language model (LLM)-based agents have made significant progress in data science, but their ability to detect data biases is still insufficiently explored. To address this gap, we introduce the first end-to-end, multi-agent synergy framework, BIASINSPECTOR, designed for automatic bias detection in structured data based on specific user requirements. It first develops a multi-stage plan to analyze user-specified bias detection tasks and then implements it with a diverse and well-suited set of tools. It delivers detailed results that include explanations and visualizations. To address the lack of a standardized framework for evaluating the capability of LLM agents to detect biases in data, we further propose a comprehensive benchmark that includes multiple evaluation metrics and a large set of test cases. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves exceptional overall performance in structured data bias detection, setting a new milestone for fairer data applications.</p></details> | 21 pages,6 figures |

Centralized approaches often suffer from the explosion of an action space that is defined by all possible combinations of individual actions, known as joint actions. Our approach addresses the coordination problem via a sequential abstraction, which overcomes the scalability problems typical to centralized methods. It introduces a meta-agent, called \textit{supervisor}, which abstracts joint actions as sequential assignments of actions to each agent. This sequential abstraction not only simplifies the centralized joint action space but also enhances the framework's scalability and efficiency. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach successfully coordinates agents across a variety of Multi-Agent Learning environments of diverse sizes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICTAI 2024</p></details> |
| **[ELT-Bench: An End-to-End Benchmark for Evaluating AI Agents on ELT Pipelines](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04808v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Practitioners are increasingly turning to Extract-Load-Transform (ELT) pipelines with the widespread adoption of cloud data warehouses. However, designing these pipelines often involves significant manual work to ensure correctness. Recent advances in AI-based methods, which have shown strong capabilities in data tasks, such as text-to-SQL, present an opportunity to alleviate manual efforts in developing ELT pipelines. Unfortunately, current benchmarks in data engineering only evaluate isolated tasks, such as using data tools and writing data transformation queries, leaving a significant gap in evaluating AI agents for generating end-to-end ELT pipelines. To fill this gap, we introduce ELT-Bench, an end-to-end benchmark designed to assess the capabilities of AI agents to build ELT pipelines. ELT-Bench consists of 100 pipelines, including 835 source tables and 203 data models across various domains. By simulating realistic scenarios involving the integration of diverse data sources and the use of popular data tools, ELT-Bench evaluates AI agents' abilities in handling complex data engineering workflows. AI agents must interact with databases and data tools, write code and SQL queries, and orchestrate every pipeline stage. We evaluate two representative code agent frameworks, Spider-Agent and SWE-Agent, using six popular Large Language Models (LLMs) on ELT-Bench. The highest-performing agent, Spider-Agent Claude-3.7-Sonnet with extended thinking, correctly generates only 3.9% of data models, with an average cost of $4.30 and 89.3 steps per pipeline. Our experimental results demonstrate the challenges of ELT-Bench and highlight the need for a more advanced AI agent to reduce manual effort in ELT workflows. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/uiuc-kang-lab/ETL.git.</p></details> | 14 pages, 18 figures |

| **[Multimodal Agricultural Agent Architecture (MA3): A New Paradigm for Intelligent Agricultural Decision-Making](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04789v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As a strategic pillar industry for human survival and development, modern agriculture faces dual challenges: optimizing production efficiency and achieving sustainable development. Against the backdrop of intensified climate change leading to frequent extreme weather events, the uncertainty risks in agricultural production systems are increasing exponentially. To address these challenges, this study proposes an innovative \textbf{M}ultimodal \textbf{A}gricultural \textbf{A}gent \textbf{A}rchitecture (\textbf{MA3}), which leverages cross-modal information fusion and task collaboration mechanisms to achieve intelligent agricultural decision-making. This study constructs a multimodal agricultural agent dataset encompassing five major tasks: classification, detection, Visual Question Answering (VQA), tool selection, and agent evaluation. We propose a unified backbone for sugarcane disease classification and detection tools, as well as a sugarcane disease expert model. By integrating an innovative tool selection module, we develop a multimodal agricultural agent capable of effectively performing tasks in classification, detection, and VQA. Furthermore, we introduce a multi-dimensional quantitative evaluation framework and conduct a comprehensive assessment of the entire architecture over our evaluation dataset, thereby verifying the practicality and robustness of MA3 in agricultural scenarios. This study provides new insights and methodologies for the development of agricultural agents, holding significant theoretical and practical implications. Our source code and dataset will be made publicly available upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Weak-for-Strong: Training Weak Meta-Agent to Harness Strong Executors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04785v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficiently leveraging of the capabilities of contemporary large language models (LLMs) is increasingly challenging, particularly when direct fine-tuning is expensive and often impractical. Existing training-free methods, including manually or automated designed workflows, typically demand substantial human effort or yield suboptimal results. This paper proposes Weak-for-Strong Harnessing (W4S), a novel framework that customizes smaller, cost-efficient language models to design and optimize workflows for harnessing stronger models. W4S formulates workflow design as a multi-turn markov decision process and introduces reinforcement learning for agentic workflow optimization (RLAO) to train a weak meta-agent. Through iterative interaction with the environment, the meta-agent learns to design increasingly effective workflows without manual intervention. Empirical results demonstrate the superiority of W4S that our 7B meta-agent, trained with just one GPU hour, outperforms the strongest baseline by 2.9% ~ 24.6% across eleven benchmarks, successfully elevating the performance of state-of-the-art models such as GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4o. Notably, W4S exhibits strong generalization capabilities across both seen and unseen tasks, offering an efficient, high-performing alternative to directly fine-tuning strong models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning for Multiple Anesthetics Collaborative Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04765v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated control of personalized multiple anesthetics in clinical Total Intravenous Anesthesia (TIVA) is crucial yet challenging. Current systems, including target-controlled infusion (TCI) and closed-loop systems, either rely on relatively static pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) models or focus on single anesthetic control, limiting personalization and collaborative control. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework, Value Decomposition Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (VD-MADRL). VD-MADRL optimizes the collaboration between two anesthetics propofol (Agent I) and remifentanil (Agent II). And It uses a Markov Game (MG) to identify optimal actions among heterogeneous agents. We employ various value function decomposition methods to resolve the credit allocation problem and enhance collaborative control. We also introduce a multivariate environment model based on random forest (RF) for anesthesia state simulation. Additionally, a data resampling and alignment technique ensures synchronized trajectory data. Our experiments on general and thoracic surgery datasets show that VD-MADRL performs better than human experience. It improves dose precision and keeps anesthesia states stable, providing great clinical value.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large-Scale Mixed-Traffic and Intersection Control using Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04691v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic congestion remains a significant challenge in modern urban networks. Autonomous driving technologies have emerged as a potential solution. Among traffic control methods, reinforcement learning has shown superior performance over traffic signals in various scenarios. However, prior research has largely focused on small-scale networks or isolated intersections, leaving large-scale mixed traffic control largely unexplored. This study presents the first attempt to use decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning for large-scale mixed traffic control in which some intersections are managed by traffic signals and others by robot vehicles. Evaluating a real-world network in Colorado Springs, CO, USA with 14 intersections, we measure traffic efficiency via average waiting time of vehicles at intersections and the number of vehicles reaching their destinations within a time window (i.e., throughput). At 80% RV penetration rate, our method reduces waiting time from 6.17 s to 5.09 s and increases throughput from 454 vehicles per 500 seconds to 493 vehicles per 500 seconds, outperforming the baseline of fully signalized intersections. These findings suggest that integrating reinforcement learning-based control large-scale traffic can improve overall efficiency and may inform future urban planning strategies.</p></details> |  |

Given available disturbance datasets, we leverage conformal prediction (CP) to address the underlying chance-constrained multi-agent STL synthesis problem in a distribution-free manner. By introducing nonconformity scores as functions of prediction regions (PRs) of error trajectories, we develop an iterative PR-scaling and disturbance-feedback synthesis approach to bound training error trajectory samples. These bounds are then calibrated using a separate dataset, providing probabilistic guarantees via CP. Subsequently, we relax the underlying stochastic optimal control problem by tightening the robustness functions of collaborative tasks based on their Lipschitz constants and the computed error bounds. To address scalability, we exploit the compositional structure of the multi-agent STL formula and propose a model-predictive-control-like algorithm, where agent-level problems are solved in a distributed fashion. Lastly, we showcase the benefits of the proposed method in comparison with [1] via an illustrative example.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 2 figures, submitted to CDC2025</p></details> |

However, progress in this field will be driven by realistic and reproducible benchmarks. We present AndroidWorld, a fully functional Android environment that provides reward signals for 116 programmatic tasks across 20 real-world Android apps. Unlike existing interactive environments, which provide a static test set, AndroidWorld dynamically constructs tasks that are parameterized and expressed in natural language in unlimited ways, thus enabling testing on a much larger and more realistic suite of tasks. To ensure reproducibility, each task includes dedicated initialization, success-checking, and tear-down logic, which modifies and inspects the device's system state. We experiment with baseline agents to test AndroidWorld and provide initial results on the benchmark. Our best agent can complete 30.6% of AndroidWorld's tasks, leaving ample room for future work. Furthermore, we adapt a popular desktop web agent to work on Android, which we find to be less effective on mobile, suggesting future research is needed to achieve universal, cross-platform agents. Finally, we also conduct a robustness analysis, showing that task variations can significantly affect agent performance, demonstrating that without such testing, agent performance metrics may not fully reflect practical challenges. AndroidWorld and the experiments in this paper are available at github.com/google-research/android_world.</p></details> |  |

However, accurate world models often have high computational demands that can severely restrict the scope and depth of such assessments. Inspired by the classic `brain in a vat' thought experiment, here we investigate ways of simplifying world models that remain agnostic to the AI agent under evaluation. By following principles from computational mechanics, our approach reveals a fundamental trade-off in world model construction between efficiency and interpretability, demonstrating that no single world model can optimise all desirable characteristics. Building on this trade-off, we identify procedures to build world models that either minimise memory requirements, delineate the boundaries of what is learnable, or allow tracking causes of undesirable outcomes. In doing so, this work establishes fundamental limits in world modelling, leading to actionable guidelines that inform core design choices related to effective agent evaluation.</p></details> | 38 pages, 5 figures |

These kind of scenarios are common in human-machine interactions, for example in autonomous driving, factory automation and healthcare. In these settings, we typically observe a trade-off between two extreme cases -- if no take-overs are allowed, then the agent might employ a sub-optimal, possibly dangerous policy. Alternatively, if there are too many take-overs, then the human has no confidence in the agent, greatly limiting its usefulness. In this paper, we formalize this setup and propose an explainability scheme to help optimize the number of human interventions.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures, in proceedings of ICML 2024 Workshop on Models of Human Feedback for AI Alignment</p></details> |

Here, we introduce CrossMatAgent -- a novel multi-agent framework that synergistically integrates large language models with state-of-the-art generative AI to revolutionize metamaterial design. By orchestrating a hierarchical team of agents -- each specializing in tasks such as pattern analysis, architectural synthesis, prompt engineering, and supervisory feedback -- our system leverages the multimodal reasoning of GPT-4o alongside the generative precision of DALL-E 3 and a fine-tuned Stable Diffusion XL model. This integrated approach automates data augmentation, enhances design fidelity, and produces simulation- and 3D printing-ready metamaterial patterns. Comprehensive evaluations, including CLIP-based alignment, SHAP interpretability analyses, and mechanical simulations under varied load conditions, demonstrate the framework's ability to generate diverse, reproducible, and application-ready designs. CrossMatAgent thus establishes a scalable, AI-driven paradigm that bridges the gap between conceptual innovation and practical realization, paving the way for accelerated metamaterial development.</p></details> |  |

However, existing agent-based models still have some limitations on behavioral realism and resource demand that limit their applicability. In this study, leveraging the emerging technology of large language models (LLMs) and LLM-based agents, we propose a general LLM-agent-based modeling framework for transportation systems. We argue that LLM agents not only possess the essential capabilities to function as agents but also offer promising solutions to overcome some limitations of existing agent-based models. Our conceptual framework design closely replicates the decision-making and interaction processes and traits of human travelers within transportation networks, and we demonstrate that the proposed systems can meet critical behavioral criteria for decision-making and learning behaviors using related studies and a demonstrative example of LLM agents' learning and adjustment in the bottleneck setting. Although further refinement of the LLM-agent-based modeling framework is necessary, we believe that this approach has the potential to improve transportation system modeling and simulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>39 pa...</summary><p>39 pages; updated framework, literature review, and results</p></details> |

However, many of these LLM agents are designed empirically or based on intuition, often lacking systematic design principles, which results in diverse agent structures with limited generality and scalability. In this paper, we advocate for building LLM agents by incorporating insights from computer systems. Inspired by the von Neumann architecture, we propose a structured framework for LLM agentic systems, emphasizing modular design and universal principles. Specifically, this paper first provides a comprehensive review of LLM agents from the computer system perspective, then identifies key challenges and future directions inspired by computer system design, and finally explores the learning mechanisms for LLM agents beyond the computer system. The insights gained from this comparative analysis offer a foundation for systematic LLM agent design and advancement.</p></details> |  |

Agent-based approaches are gaining popularity for processing long videos, as they can handle extended sequences and integrate various tools to capture fine-grained information. However, existing methods still face several challenges: (1) they often rely solely on the reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs) without dedicated mechanisms to enhance reasoning in long video scenarios; and (2) they remain vulnerable to errors or noise from external tools. To address these issues, we propose a specialized chain-of-thought (CoT) process tailored for long video analysis. Our proposed CoT with plan-adjust mode enables the LLM to incrementally plan and adapt its information-gathering strategy. We further incorporate heuristic uncertainty estimation of both the LLM and external tools to guide the CoT process. This allows the LLM to assess the reliability of newly collected information, refine its collection strategy, and make more robust decisions when synthesizing final answers. Empirical experiments show that our uncertainty-aware CoT effectively mitigates noise from external tools, leading to more reliable outputs. We implement our approach in a system called VideoAgent2, which also includes additional modules such as general context acquisition and specialized tool design. Evaluation on three dedicated long video benchmarks (and their subsets) demonstrates that VideoAgent2 outperforms the previous state-of-the-art agent-based method, VideoAgent, by an average of 13.1% and achieves leading performance among all zero-shot approaches</p></details> |  |

As the demand escalates, these algorithms are struggling to cope. In this context, reinforcement learning (RL) and multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms emerge as promising solutions. However, the urgency and importance of the problem are clear, as existing RL/MARL-based routing approaches lack effective communication in run time among routers, making it challenging for individual routers to adapt to complex and dynamic changing networks. More importantly, they lack the ability to deal with dynamically changing network topology, especially the addition of the router, due to the non-scalability of their neural networks. This paper proposes a novel dynamic routing algorithm, DRAMA, incorporating emergent communication in multi-agent reinforcement learning. Through emergent communication, routers could learn how to communicate effectively to maximize the optimization objectives. Meanwhile, a new Q-network and graph-based emergent communication are introduced to dynamically adapt to the changing network topology without retraining while ensuring robust performance. Experimental results showcase DRAMA's superior performance over the traditional routing algorithm and other RL/MARL-based algorithms, achieving a higher delivery rate and lower latency in diverse network scenarios, including dynamic network load and topology. Moreover, an ablation experiment validates the prospect of emergent communication in facilitating packet routing.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This article has been accepted by IJCNN 2025</p></details> |

Manually tuning this combination is tedious, error-prone, and non-transferable across LLMs or tasks. Therefore, this paper proposes AutoPDL, an automated approach to discover good LLM agent configurations. Our method frames this as a structured AutoML problem over a combinatorial space of agentic and non-agentic prompting patterns and demonstrations, using successive halving to efficiently navigate this space. We introduce a library implementing common prompting patterns using the PDL prompt programming language. AutoPDL solutions are human-readable, editable, and executable PDL programs that use this library. This approach also enables source-to-source optimization, allowing human-in-the-loop refinement and reuse. Evaluations across three tasks and six LLMs (ranging from 8B to 70B parameters) show consistent accuracy gains ($9.5\pm17.5$ percentage points), up to 68.9pp, and reveal that selected prompting strategies vary across models and tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[ChronoSync: A Decentralized Chronometer Synchronization Protocol for Multi-Agent Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04347v1)** | 2025-04-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work presents a decentralized time synchronization algorithm for multi-agent systems. Each agent possesses two clocks, a hardware clock that is perturbed by environmental phenomena (e.g., temperature, humidity, pressure, g forces, etc.) and a steerable software clock that inherits the perturbations affecting the hardware clock. Under these disturbances and the independent time kept by the hardware clocks, our consensus-based controller enables all agents to steer their software-defined clocks into practical synchronization while achieving a common user-defined clock drift. Furthermore, we treat the drift of each hardware clock as an unknown parameter, which our algorithm can accurately estimate. The coupling of the agents is modeled by a connected, undirected, and static graph. However, each agent possesses a timer mechanism that determines when to broadcast a sample of its software time and update its own software-time estimate. Hence, communication between agents can be directed, intermittent, and asynchronous. The closed-loop dynamics of the ensemble is modeled using a hybrid system, where a Lyapunov-based stability analysis demonstrates that a set encoding the time synchronization and clock drift estimation objectives is globally practically exponentially stable. The performance suggested by the theoretical development is confirmed in simulation.</p></details> |  |

This gap underscores the need for a deeper understanding of their potential in tackling structured, constraint-intensive problems-a pursuit currently limited by the absence of comprehensive benchmarks for systematic investigation. To address this, we introduce CO-Bench, a benchmark suite featuring 36 real-world CO problems drawn from a broad range of domains and complexity levels. CO-Bench includes structured problem formulations and curated data to support rigorous investigation of LLM agents. We evaluate multiple agent frameworks against established human-designed algorithms, revealing key strengths and limitations of current approaches and identifying promising directions for future research.

This presents an opportunity for humans to collaborate with the agent and leverage the agent's capabilities effectively. We propose CowPilot, a framework supporting autonomous as well as human-agent collaborative web navigation, and evaluation across task success and task efficiency. CowPilot reduces the number of steps humans need to perform by allowing agents to propose next steps, while users are able to pause, reject, or take alternative actions. During execution, users can interleave their actions with the agent by overriding suggestions or resuming agent control when needed. We conducted case studies on five common websites and found that the human-agent collaborative mode achieves the highest success rate of 95% while requiring humans to perform only 15.2% of the total steps. Even with human interventions during task execution, the agent successfully drives up to half of task success on its own.

| **[AdaCoder: An Adaptive Planning and Multi-Agent Framework for Function-Level Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04220v1)** | 2025-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, researchers have proposed many multi-agent frameworks for function-level code generation, which aim to improve software development productivity by automatically generating function-level source code based on task descriptions. A typical multi-agent framework consists of Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents that are responsible for task planning, code generation, testing, debugging, etc. Studies have shown that existing multi-agent code generation frameworks perform well on ChatGPT. However, their generalizability across other foundation LLMs remains unexplored systematically. In this paper, we report an empirical study on the generalizability of four state-of-the-art multi-agent code generation frameworks across six open-source LLMs with varying parameter sizes, architectures, and performance levels. Our study reveals the unstable generalizability of existing frameworks on diverse foundation LLMs. Based on the findings obtained from the empirical study, we propose AdaCoder, a novel adaptive planning, multi-agent framework for function-level code generation. AdaCoder has two phases. Phase-1 is an initial code generation step without planning, which uses an LLM-based coding agent and a script-based testing agent to unleash LLM's native power, identify cases beyond LLM's power, and determine the errors hindering execution. Phase-2 adds a rule-based debugging agent and an LLM-based planning agent for iterative code generation with planning. Our evaluation shows that AdaCoder achieves higher generalizability on diverse LLMs. Compared to the best baseline MapCoder, AdaCoder is on average 27.69% higher in Pass@1, 16 times faster in inference, and 12 times lower in token consumption.</p></details> |  |

Improvements via standard fine-tuning is often impractical, as solving agentic tasks usually relies on black box API access without control over model parameters. Inference-time methods such as Best-of-N (BON) sampling offer a simple yet effective alternative to improve performance. However, BON lacks iterative feedback integration mechanism. Hence, we propose Iterative Agent Decoding (IAD) which combines iterative refinement with dynamic candidate evaluation and selection guided by a verifier. IAD differs in how feedback is designed and integrated, specifically optimized to extract maximal signal from reward scores. We conduct a detailed comparison of baselines across key metrics on Sketch2Code, Text2SQL, and Webshop where IAD consistently outperforms baselines, achieving 3--6% absolute gains on Sketch2Code and Text2SQL (with and without LLM judges) and 8--10% gains on Webshop across multiple metrics. To better understand the source of IAD's gains, we perform controlled experiments to disentangle the effect of adaptive feedback from stochastic sampling, and find that IAD's improvements are primarily driven by verifier-guided refinement, not merely sampling diversity. We also show that both IAD and BON exhibit inference-time scaling with increased compute when guided by an optimal verifier. Our analysis highlights the critical role of verifier quality in effective inference-time optimization and examines the impact of noisy and sparse rewards on scaling behavior. Together, these findings offer key insights into the trade-offs and principles of effective inference-time optimization.</p></details> |  |

Challenges such as collision avoidance, station-keeping, and orbital maneuvering require advanced techniques to handle dynamic uncertainties and multi-agent interactions. Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in this domain, enabling adaptive, autonomous policies for space operations; however, many existing RL frameworks rely on custom-built environments developed from scratch, which often use simplified models and require significant time to implement and validate the orbital dynamics, limiting their ability to fully capture real-world complexities. To address this, we introduce OrbitZoo, a versatile multi-agent RL environment built on a high-fidelity industry standard library, that enables realistic data generation, supports scenarios like collision avoidance and cooperative maneuvers, and ensures robust and accurate orbital dynamics. The environment is validated against a real satellite constellation, Starlink, achieving a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 0.16% compared to real-world data. This validation ensures reliability for generating high-fidelity simulations and enabling autonomous and independent satellite operations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Among Us: A Sandbox for Agentic Deception](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04072v1)** | 2025-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Studying deception in AI agents is important and difficult due to the lack of model organisms and sandboxes that elicit the behavior without asking the model to act under specific conditions or inserting intentional backdoors. Extending upon $\textit{AmongAgents}$, a text-based social-deduction game environment, we aim to fix this by introducing Among Us as a rich sandbox where LLM-agents exhibit human-style deception naturally while they think, speak, and act with other agents or humans. We introduce Deception ELO as an unbounded measure of deceptive capability, suggesting that frontier models win more because they're better at deception, not at detecting it. We evaluate the effectiveness of AI safety techniques (LLM-monitoring of outputs, linear probes on various datasets, and sparse autoencoders) for detecting lying and deception in Among Us, and find that they generalize very well out-of-distribution. We open-source our sandbox as a benchmark for future alignment research and hope that this is a good testbed to improve safety techniques to detect and remove agentically-motivated deception, and to anticipate deceptive abilities in LLMs.</p></details> | 17 pages, preprint |
| **[Enforcement Agents: Enhancing Accountability and Resilience in Multi-Agent AI Frameworks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04070v1)** | 2025-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As autonomous agents become more powerful and widely used, it is becoming increasingly important to ensure they behave safely and stay aligned with system goals, especially in multi-agent settings. Current systems often rely on agents self-monitoring or correcting issues after the fact, but they lack mechanisms for real-time oversight. This paper introduces the Enforcement Agent (EA) Framework, which embeds dedicated supervisory agents into the environment to monitor others, detect misbehavior, and intervene through real-time correction. We implement this framework in a custom drone simulation and evaluate it across 90 episodes using 0, 1, and 2 EA configurations. Results show that adding EAs significantly improves system safety: success rates rise from 0.0% with no EA to 7.4% with one EA and 26.7% with two EAs. The system also demonstrates increased operational longevity and higher rates of malicious drone reformation. These findings highlight the potential of lightweight, real-time supervision for enhancing alignment and resilience in multi-agent systems.</p></details> |  |

Unlike traditional generative AI, which is reactive to user prompts, agentic AI proactively orchestrates complex workflows. It exhibits stochastic, dynamic, and fluid autonomy: its steps and outputs vary probabilistically (stochastic), it evolves based on prior interactions (dynamic), and it operates with significant independence within human-defined parameters, adapting to context (fluid). While this fosters complex, co-evolutionary human-machine interactions capable of generating uniquely synthesized creative outputs, it also irrevocably blurs boundaries--human and machine contributions become irreducibly entangled in intertwined creative processes. Consequently, agentic AI poses significant challenges to legal frameworks reliant on clear attribution: authorship doctrines struggle to disentangle ownership, intellectual property regimes strain to accommodate recursively blended novelty, and liability models falter as accountability diffuses across shifting loci of control. The central issue is not the legal treatment of human versus machine contributions, but the fundamental unmappability--the practical impossibility in many cases--of accurately attributing specific creative elements to either source. When retroactively parsing contributions becomes infeasible, applying distinct standards based on origin becomes impracticable. Therefore, we argue, legal and policy frameworks may need to treat human and machine contributions as functionally equivalent--not for moral or economic reasons, but as a pragmatic necessity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-agent Auto-Bidding with Latent Graph Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05805v2)** | 2025-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a diffusion-based auto-bidding framework that leverages graph representations to model large-scale auction environments. In such settings, agents must dynamically optimize bidding strategies under constraints defined by key performance indicator (KPI) metrics, all while operating in competitive environments characterized by uncertain, sparse, and stochastic variables. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel approach combining learnable graph-based embeddings with a planning-based latent diffusion model (LDM). By capturing patterns and nuances underlying the interdependence of impression opportunities and the multi-agent dynamics of the auction environment, the graph representation enable expressive computations regarding auto-bidding outcomes. With reward alignment techniques, the LDM's posterior is fine-tuned to generate auto-bidding trajectories that maximize KPI metrics while satisfying constraint thresholds. Empirical evaluations on both real-world and synthetic auction environments demonstrate significant improvements in auto-bidding performance across multiple common KPI metrics, as well as accuracy in forecasting auction outcomes.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances in Large Language Model-simulated Agent (LLM-Agent) research inspired us to design UXAgent to support UX researchers in evaluating and reiterating their usability testing study design before they conduct the real human subject study. Our system features an LLM-Agent module and a universal browser connector module so that UX researchers can automatically generate thousands of simulated users to test the target website. The results are shown in qualitative (e.g., interviewing how an agent thinks ), quantitative (e.g., # of actions), and video recording formats for UX researchers to analyze. Through a heuristic user evaluation with five UX researchers, participants praised the innovation of our system but also expressed concerns about the future of LLM Agent-assisted UX study.</p></details> |  |
| **[Impact of Price Inflation on Algorithmic Collusion Through Reinforcement Learning Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05335v1)** | 2025-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Algorithmic pricing is increasingly shaping market competition, raising concerns about its potential to compromise competitive dynamics. While prior work has shown that reinforcement learning (RL)-based pricing algorithms can lead to tacit collusion, less attention has been given to the role of macroeconomic factors in shaping these dynamics. This study examines the role of inflation in influencing algorithmic collusion within competitive markets. By incorporating inflation shocks into a RL-based pricing model, we analyze whether agents adapt their strategies to sustain supra-competitive profits. Our findings indicate that inflation reduces market competitiveness by fostering implicit coordination among agents, even without direct collusion. However, despite achieving sustained higher profitability, agents fail to develop robust punishment mechanisms to deter deviations from equilibrium strategies. The results suggest that inflation amplifies non-competitive dynamics in algorithmic pricing, emphasizing the need for regulatory oversight in markets where AI-driven pricing is prevalent.</p></details> |  |

High-quality annotations are essential for effectively understanding time series and facilitating downstream tasks; however, obtaining such annotations is challenging, particularly in mission-critical domains. In this paper, we propose TESSA, a multi-agent system designed to automatically generate both general and domain-specific annotations for time series data. TESSA introduces two agents: a general annotation agent and a domain-specific annotation agent. The general agent captures common patterns and knowledge across multiple source domains, leveraging both time-series-wise and text-wise features to generate general annotations. Meanwhile, the domain-specific agent utilizes limited annotations from the target domain to learn domain-specific terminology and generate targeted annotations. Extensive experiments on multiple synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that TESSA effectively generates high-quality annotations, outperforming existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 12 figures, 32 tables</p></details> |

The PerAnsSumm Shared Task was therefore proposed to tackle this challenge by identifying perspectives from different answers and then generating a comprehensive answer to the question. In this study, we address the PerAnsSumm Shared Task using two complementary paradigms: (i) a training-based approach through QLoRA fine-tuning of LLaMA-3.3-70B-Instruct, and (ii) agentic approaches including zero- and few-shot prompting with frontier LLMs (LLaMA-3.3-70B-Instruct and GPT-4o) and a Mixture-of-Agents (MoA) framework that leverages a diverse set of LLMs by combining outputs from multi-layer feedback aggregation. For perspective span identification/classification, GPT-4o zero-shot achieves an overall score of 0.57, substantially outperforming the 0.40 score of the LLaMA baseline. With a 2-layer MoA configuration, we were able to improve LLaMA performance up by 28 percent to 0.51. For perspective-based summarization, GPT-4o zero-shot attains an overall score of 0.42 compared to 0.28 for the best LLaMA zero-shot, and our 2-layer MoA approach boosts LLaMA performance by 32 percent to 0.37. Furthermore, in few-shot setting, our results show that the sentence-transformer embedding-based exemplar selection provides more gain than manually selected exemplars on LLaMA models, although the few-shot prompting is not always helpful for GPT-4o. The YaleNLP team's approach ranked the overall second place in the shared task.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted at CL4HEALTH @ NAACL 2025: Annual Conference of the Nations of the Americas Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics</p></details> |
| **[PAFFA: Premeditated Actions For Fast Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07958v2)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern AI assistants have made significant progress in natural language understanding and tool-use, with emerging efforts to interact with Web interfaces. However, current approaches that heavily rely on repeated LLM-driven HTML parsing are computationally expensive and error-prone, particularly when handling dynamic web interfaces and multi-step tasks. We introduce PAFFA (Premeditated Actions For Fast Agents), a method that makes LLMs faster and more accurate in completing tasks on the internet using a novel inference-time technique that requires no task-specific training. PAFFA constructs an 'Action Library', leveraging the parametric knowledge of the base LLM to pre-compute browser interaction patterns that generalize across tasks. By strategically re-using LLM inference across tasks - either via 'Dist-Map' for task-agnostic identification of key interactive web elements, or 'Unravel' for first-encounter, stateful exploration of novel tasks/sites) - PAFFA drastically reduces inference time tokens by 87% while maintaining robust performance (achieving 0.57 vs. 0.50 step accuracy compared to baseline). Further, Unravel's ability to update its action library based on explorations allows generalization and adaptation to unseen websites. In sum, this work exhibits that LLM reasoning sequences can generalize across prompts, offering a way to scale inference-time techniques for internet-scale data with sublinear token count.</p></details> | 16 pages |

However, LLM-based agents face substantial challenges when deployed in novel environments or required to navigate unconventional action spaces. To empower agents to autonomously explore environments, optimize workflows, and enhance their understanding of actions, we propose SynWorld, a framework that allows agents to synthesize possible scenarios with multi-step action invocation within the action space and perform Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) exploration to effectively refine their action knowledge in the current environment. Our experiments demonstrate that SynWorld is an effective and general approach to learning action knowledge in new environments.

| **[Agentic Knowledgeable Self-awareness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03553v1)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved considerable performance across various agentic planning tasks. However, traditional agent planning approaches adopt a "flood irrigation" methodology that indiscriminately injects gold trajectories, external feedback, and domain knowledge into agent models. This practice overlooks the fundamental human cognitive principle of situational self-awareness during decision-making-the ability to dynamically assess situational demands and strategically employ resources during decision-making. We propose agentic knowledgeable self-awareness to address this gap, a novel paradigm enabling LLM-based agents to autonomously regulate knowledge utilization. Specifically, we propose KnowSelf, a data-centric approach that applies agents with knowledgeable self-awareness like humans. Concretely, we devise a heuristic situation judgement criterion to mark special tokens on the agent's self-explored trajectories for collecting training data. Through a two-stage training process, the agent model can switch between different situations by generating specific special tokens, achieving optimal planning effects with minimal costs. Our experiments demonstrate that KnowSelf can outperform various strong baselines on different tasks and models with minimal use of external knowledge.

Traditional model-based and data-driven techniques lack adaptability, while more flexible generative AI methods struggle with grounding extracted information to real-world constraints. We introduce RAIDER, a novel agent that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with grounded tools for adaptable and efficient issue detection and explanation. Using a unique "Ground, Ask&Answer, Issue" procedure, RAIDER dynamically generates context-aware precondition questions and selects appropriate tools for resolution, achieving targeted information gathering. Our results within a simulated household environment surpass methods relying on predefined models, full scene descriptions, or standalone trained models. Additionally, RAIDER's explanations enhance recovery success, including cases requiring human interaction. Its modular architecture, featuring self-correction mechanisms, enables straightforward adaptation to diverse scenarios, as demonstrated in a real-world human-assistive task. This showcases RAIDER's potential as a versatile agentic AI solution for robotic issue detection and explanation, while addressing the problem of grounding generative AI for its effective application in embodied agents.

This implements a complete pipeline from idea generation to experimental evaluation and research dissemination, mimicking the scientific process typically performed by human researchers. The system employs specialized agents for planning, coding, execution, analysis, and synthesis that work together to develop novel approaches. Unlike traditional auto machine-learning systems, the AI Cosmologist generates diverse implementation strategies, writes complete code, handles execution errors, analyzes results, and synthesizes new approaches based on experimental outcomes. We demonstrate the AI Cosmologist capabilities across several machine learning tasks, showing how it can successfully explore solution spaces, iterate based on experimental results, and combine successful elements from different approaches. Our results indicate that agentic systems can automate portions of the research process, potentially accelerating scientific discovery. The code and experimental data used in this paper are available on GitHub at https://github.com/adammoss/aicosmologist.

Classical robust control often assumes worst-case disturbances, leading to overly conservative actions. In this work, we propose a learning-based framework that combines conformal prediction with model predictive control (MPC) to ensure probabilistic safety under action-level uncertainty. Unlike prior approaches that predict future states, we directly model the control action of the uncontrollable agent as a stochastic function of the joint state, trained via neural networks and calibrated using conformal prediction. This enables us to construct dynamic, probabilistically guaranteed reachable tubes for the uncontrollable agent. These tubes are then embedded into an MPC formulation to synthesize control actions for the controllable agent that ensure safe interactions over a finite planning horizon. We provide formal stepwise and cumulative safety guarantees, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through a pedestrian-vehicle interaction scenario. Compared to baseline methods, our framework achieves higher safety rates while maintaining high performance in terms of speed and responsiveness.</p></details> |  |

A Critical Review of Generative Social Simulations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03274v1)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in AI have reinvigorated Agent-Based Models (ABMs), as the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to the emergence of ``generative ABMs'' as a novel approach to simulating social systems. While ABMs offer means to bridge micro-level interactions with macro-level patterns, they have long faced criticisms from social scientists, pointing to e.g., lack of realism, computational complexity, and challenges of calibrating and validating against empirical data. This paper reviews the generative ABM literature to assess how this new approach adequately addresses these long-standing criticisms. Our findings show that studies show limited awareness of historical debates. Validation remains poorly addressed, with many studies relying solely on subjective assessments of model `believability', and even the most rigorous validation failing to adequately evidence operational validity. We argue that there are reasons to believe that LLMs will exacerbate rather than resolve the long-standing challenges of ABMs. The black-box nature of LLMs moreover limit their usefulness for disentangling complex emergent causal mechanisms. While generative ABMs are still in a stage of early experimentation, these findings question of whether and how the field can transition to the type of rigorous modeling needed to contribute to social scientific theory.</p></details> |  |

Our analysis complements existing risk-based studies on artificial agency and covers the spectrum of important aspects of the principal-agent relationship and their potential consequences at deployment. Furthermore, we motivate method developments for technical governance along the directions of interpretability and behavior evaluations, reward and conflict management, and the mitigation of misalignment and misconduct through principled engineering of detection and fail-safe mechanisms. By illustrating the outstanding issues in AI liability for LLM-based agentic systems, we aim to inform the system design, auditing and monitoring approaches to enhancing transparency and accountability.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages content (incl. appendix) + 12 pages references, comments welcome</p></details> |

In this paper, we introduce a general unified framework for heterogeneous multi-agent coordination using the language of cellular sheaves and nonlinear sheaf Laplacians, which are generalizations of graphs and graph Laplacians. Specifically, we introduce the concept of a nonlinear homological program encompassing a choice of cellular sheaf on an undirected graph, nonlinear edge potential functions, and constrained convex node objectives, which constitutes a standard form for a wide class of coordination problems. We use the alternating direction method of multipliers to derive a distributed optimization algorithm for solving these nonlinear homological programs. To demonstrate the applicability of this framework, we show how heterogeneous coordination goals including combinations of consensus, formation, and flocking can be formulated as nonlinear homological programs and provide numerical simulations showing the efficacy of our distributed solution algorithm.</p></details> |  |

In the context of multiagent control, the objective is to control the configuration of a swarm of identical, interacting cooperative agents, as captured by the time-varying probability measure of their state. Available methods for solving this problem for distributions with continuous support rely either on spatial discretizations of the problem's domain or on approximating optimal solutions using neural networks trained through stochastic optimization schemes. For agents following Linear Time-Varying dynamics, and for Gaussian Mixture Model boundary distributions, we propose a highly efficient parameterization to approximate the solutions of the corresponding MFSB in closed form, without any learning steps. Our proposed approach consists of a mixture of elementary policies, each solving a Gaussian-to-Gaussian Covariance Steering problem from the components of the initial to the components of the terminal mixture. Leveraging the semidefinite formulation of the Covariance Steering problem, our proposed solver can handle probabilistic hard constraints on the system's state, while maintaining numerical tractability. We illustrate our approach on a variety of numerical examples.</p></details> |  |

However, the integration of multi-tool capabilities in LLM agents introduces challenges in securely managing tools, ensuring their compatibility, handling dependency relationships, and protecting control flows within LLM agent workflows. In this paper, we present the first systematic security analysis of task control flows in multi-tool-enabled LLM agents. We identify a novel threat, Cross-Tool Harvesting and Polluting (XTHP), which includes multiple attack vectors to first hijack the normal control flows of agent tasks, and then collect and pollute confidential or private information within LLM agent systems. To understand the impact of this threat, we developed Chord, a dynamic scanning tool designed to automatically detect real-world agent tools susceptible to XTHP attacks. Our evaluation of 73 real-world tools from the repositories of two major LLM agent development frameworks, LangChain and LlamaIndex, revealed a significant security concern: 80% of the tools are vulnerable to hijacking attacks, 78% to XTH attacks, and 41% to XTP attacks, highlighting the prevalence of this threat.</p></details> |  |

We show that the temporality of search engine translates into tool-dependent agent performance but can be alleviated with base model choice and explicit reasoning instructions such as chain-of-thought prompting.

Specifically, a two-agent scenario is studied where each agent aims to correctly infer the true state of nature while optimizing decision speed and accuracy. At each iteration, agents collect private observations, update their beliefs, and share (possibly corrupted) belief signals with their counterparts before deciding whether to stop and declare a state, or continue gathering more information. The analysis yields three main results: (1)~when agents share information strategically, the optimal signaling policy involves equal-probability randomization between truthful and inverted beliefs; (2)~agents maximize performance by relying solely on their own observations for belief updating while using received information only to anticipate their counterpart's stopping decision; and (3)~the agent reaching their confidence threshold first cause the other agent to achieve a higher conditional probability of error. Numerical simulations further demonstrate that agents with higher KL divergence in their conditional distributions gain competitive advantage. Furthermore, our results establish that information sharing -- despite strategic manipulation -- reduces overall system stopping time compared to non-interactive scenarios, which highlights the inherent value of communication even in this competitive setup.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, submitted to IEEE Conference on Decision and Control 2025</p></details> |
| **[Agentic Large Language Models, a survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23037v2)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There is great interest in agentic LLMs, large language models that act as agents. We review the growing body of work in this area and provide a research agenda. Agentic LLMs are LLMs that (1) reason, (2) act, and (3) interact. We organize the literature according to these three categories. The research in the first category focuses on reasoning, reflection, and retrieval, aiming to improve decision making; the second category focuses on action models, robots, and tools, aiming for agents that act as useful assistants; the third category focuses on multi-agent systems, aiming for collaborative task solving and simulating interaction to study emergent social behavior. We find that works mutually benefit from results in other categories: retrieval enables tool use, reflection improves multi-agent collaboration, and reasoning benefits all categories. We discuss applications of agentic LLMs and provide an agenda for further research. Important applications are in medical diagnosis, logistics and financial market analysis. Meanwhile, self-reflective agents playing roles and interacting with one another augment the process of scientific research itself. Further, agentic LLMs may provide a solution for the problem of LLMs running out of training data: inference-time behavior generates new training states, such that LLMs can keep learning without needing ever larger datasets. We note that there is risk associated with LLM assistants taking action in the real world, while agentic LLMs are also likely to benefit society.</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website: https://askeplaat.github.io/agentic-llm-survey-site/</p></details> |

However, to enhance its utility and reduce potential harm, SFT and alignment are applied sequentially to the pretrained model. Due to the differing nature and objective functions of SFT and alignment, catastrophic forgetting has become a significant issue. To address this, we introduce Unified Fine-Tuning (UFT), which integrates SFT and alignment into a single training stage using the same objective and loss functions through an implicit reward function. Our experimental results demonstrate that UFT outperforms SFT on instruction-tuning data alone. Moreover, when combining instruction-tuning data with alignment data, UFT effectively prevents catastrophic forgetting across these two stages and shows a clear advantage over sequentially applying SFT and alignment. This is evident in the significant improvements observed in the \textbf{ifeval} task for instruction-following and the \textbf{truthful-qa} task for factuality. The proposed general fine-tuning framework UFT establishes an effective and efficient pretraining-UFT paradigm for LLM training.</p></details> |  |

However, existing approaches struggle with temporal reasoning due to weak temporal correspondence in the data and reliance on the next-token prediction paradigm during training. To address these limitations, we propose TEMPLE (TEMporal Preference Learning), a systematic framework that enhances Video LLMs' temporal reasoning capabilities through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). To facilitate this, we introduce an automated preference data generation pipeline that systematically constructs preference pairs by selecting videos that are rich in temporal information, designing video-specific perturbation strategies, and finally evaluating model responses on clean and perturbed video inputs. Our temporal alignment features two key innovations: curriculum learning which that progressively increases perturbation difficulty to improve model robustness and adaptability; and "Pre-SFT Alignment'', applying preference optimization before instruction tuning to prioritize fine-grained temporal comprehension. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently improves Video LLM performance across multiple benchmarks with a relatively small set of self-generated DPO data. We further analyze the transferability of DPO data across architectures and the role of difficulty scheduling in optimization. Our findings highlight our TEMPLE as a scalable and efficient complement to SFT-based methods, paving the way for developing reliable Video LLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/lscpku/TEMPLE.</p></details> |  |

However, due to the substantial differences between remote sensing images and conventional optical images, these models face considerable challenges in comprehension, especially in detection tasks. Directly prompting VLMs with detection instructions often leads to unsatisfactory results. To address this issue, this letter explores the application of VLMs for object detection in remote sensing images. Specifically, we constructed supervised fine-tuning (SFT) datasets using publicly available remote sensing object detection datasets, including SSDD, HRSID, and NWPU-VHR-10. In these new datasets, we converted annotation information into JSON-compliant natural language descriptions, facilitating more effective understanding and training for the VLM. We then evaluate the detection performance of various fine-tuning strategies for VLMs and derive optimized model weights for object detection in remote sensing images. Finally, we evaluate the model's prior knowledge capabilities using natural language queries. Experimental results demonstrate that, without modifying the model architecture, remote sensing object detection can be effectively achieved using natural language alone. Additionally, the model exhibits the ability to perform certain vision question answering (VQA) tasks. Our datasets and related code will be released soon.</p></details> |  |

However, attempts to extend this success to multimodal reasoning often failed to reproduce these key characteristics. In this report, we present the first successful replication of these emergent characteristics for multimodal reasoning on only a non-SFT 2B model. Starting with Qwen2-VL-2B and applying reinforcement learning directly on the SAT dataset, our model achieves 59.47% accuracy on CVBench, outperforming the base model by approximately ~30% and exceeding both SFT setting by ~2%. In addition, we share our failed attempts and insights in attempting to achieve R1-like reasoning using RL with instruct models. aiming to shed light on the challenges involved. Our key observations include: (1) applying RL on instruct model often results in trivial reasoning trajectories, and (2) naive length reward are ineffective in eliciting reasoning capabilities.

However, RLHF has been continuously challenged by its high complexity in implementation and computation consumption. Even with recent simplifications, such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Advantage Leftover Lunch (A-LoL), the problems of over-fitting and training instability remain hindering the alignment process from the expected optimal performance. To address the existing challenges, we propose a novel simplification of RLHF from the perspective of variational inference, called $\textbf{V}$ariational $\textbf{A}$lignment with $\textbf{R}$e-weighting ($\textbf{VAR}$). More specifically, by directly minimizing the distribution gap between the learning LLM policy and the optimal solution of RLHF, we transform the alignment objective into a reward-driven re-weighted supervised fine-tuning (SFT) form, which only requires minor adjustment on the SFT loss to obtain noticeable improvement on training stability and effectiveness. On comprehensive alignment and generation benchmarks, our VAR method has numerically achieved competitive performance in LLM alignment helpfulness and harmlessness.</p></details> |  |
| **[SFT Memorizes, RL Generalizes: A Comparative Study of Foundation Model Post-training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17161v1)** | 2025-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) are widely used post-training techniques for foundation models. However, their roles in enhancing model generalization capabilities remain unclear. This paper studies the difference between SFT and RL on generalization and memorization, focusing on text-based rule variants and visual variants. We introduce GeneralPoints, an arithmetic reasoning card game, and adopt V-IRL, a real-world navigation environment, to assess how models trained with SFT and RL generalize to unseen variants in both textual and visual domains. We show that RL, especially when trained with an outcome-based reward, generalizes across both rule-based textual and visual variants. SFT, in contrast, tends to memorize training data and struggles to generalize out-of-distribution scenarios. Further analysis reveals that RL improves the model's underlying visual recognition capabilities, contributing to its enhanced generalization in the visual domain. Despite RL's superior generalization, we show that SFT remains essential for effective RL training; SFT stabilizes the model's output format, enabling subsequent RL to achieve its performance gains. These findings demonstrates the capability of RL for acquiring generalizable knowledge in complex, multi-modal tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website at https://tianzhechu.com/SFTvsRL</p></details> |
| **[Provably Mitigating Overoptimization in RLHF: Your SFT Loss is Implicitly an Adversarial Regularizer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16436v3)** | 2024-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aligning generative models with human preference via RLHF typically suffers from overoptimization, where an imperfectly learned reward model can misguide the generative model to output undesired responses. We investigate this problem in a principled manner by identifying the source of the misalignment as a form of distributional shift and uncertainty in learning human preferences. To mitigate overoptimization, we first propose a theoretical algorithm that chooses the best policy for an adversarially chosen reward model; one that simultaneously minimizes the maximum likelihood estimation of the loss and a reward penalty term. Here, the reward penalty term is introduced to prevent the policy from choosing actions with spurious high proxy rewards, resulting in provable sample efficiency of the algorithm under a partial coverage style condition. Moving from theory to practice, the proposed algorithm further enjoys an equivalent but surprisingly easy-to-implement reformulation. Using the equivalence between reward models and the corresponding optimal policy, the algorithm features a simple objective that combines: (i) a preference optimization loss that directly aligns the policy with human preference, and (ii) a supervised learning loss that explicitly imitates the policy with a (suitable) baseline distribution. In the context of aligning large language models (LLM), this objective fuses the direct preference optimization (DPO) loss with the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) loss to help mitigate the overoptimization towards undesired responses, for which we name the algorithm Regularized Preference Optimization (RPO). Experiments of aligning LLMs demonstrate the improved performance of RPO compared with DPO baselines. Our work sheds light on the interplay between preference optimization and SFT in tuning LLMs with both theoretical guarantees and empirical evidence.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by The Thirty-Eighth Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems. 31 pages, 7 figures</p></details> |
| **[Continual SFT Matches Multimodal RLHF with Negative Supervision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14797v1)** | 2024-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal RLHF usually happens after supervised finetuning (SFT) stage to continually improve vision-language models' (VLMs) comprehension. Conventional wisdom holds its superiority over continual SFT during this preference alignment stage. In this paper, we observe that the inherent value of multimodal RLHF lies in its negative supervision, the logit of the rejected responses. We thus propose a novel negative supervised finetuning (nSFT) approach that fully excavates these information resided. Our nSFT disentangles this negative supervision in RLHF paradigm, and continually aligns VLMs with a simple SFT loss. This is more memory efficient than multimodal RLHF where 2 (e.g., DPO) or 4 (e.g., PPO) large VLMs are strictly required. The effectiveness of nSFT is rigorously proved by comparing it with various multimodal RLHF approaches, across different dataset sources, base VLMs and evaluation metrics. Besides, fruitful of ablations are provided to support our hypothesis. We hope this paper will stimulate further research to properly align large vision language models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Getting More Juice Out of the SFT Data: Reward Learning from Human Demonstration Improves SFT for LLM Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17888v3)** | 2024-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aligning human preference and value is an important requirement for contemporary foundation models. State-of-the-art techniques such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) often consist of two stages: 1) supervised fine-tuning (SFT), where the model is fine-tuned by learning from human demonstration data; 2) Preference learning, where preference data is used to learn a reward model, which is in turn used by a reinforcement learning (RL) step to fine-tune the model. Such reward model serves as a proxy to human preference, and it is critical to guide the RL step towards improving the model quality. In this work, we argue that the SFT stage significantly benefits from learning a reward model as well. Instead of using the human demonstration data directly via supervised learning, we propose to leverage an Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) technique to simultaneously build an reward model and a policy model. This approach leads to new SFT algorithms that are not only efficient to implement, but are robust to the presence of low-quality supervised learning data. Moreover, we discover a connection between the proposed IRL based approach, and a recent line of works called Self-Play Fine-tune (SPIN). Theoretically, we show that the proposed algorithms converge to the stationary solutions of the IRL problem. Empirically, we align 1B and 7B models using proposed methods and evaluate them on a reward benchmark model and the HuggingFace Open LLM Leaderboard. The proposed methods show significant performance improvement over existing SFT approaches. Our results indicate that it is beneficial to leverage reward learning throughout the entire alignment process.</p></details> |  |

The paradigm contains supervised fine tuning and reinforce learning from human feedback. This paradigm is also used in downstream scenarios to adapt LLM to specific corpora and applications. Comparing to SFT, there are many efforts focused on RLHF and several algorithms being proposed, such as PPO, DPO, IPO, KTO, MinorDPO and etc. Meanwhile most efforts for SFT are focused on how to collect, filter and mix high quality data. In this article with insight from DPO and MinorDPO, we propose a training metric for SFT to measure the discrepancy between the optimized model and the original model, and a loss function MinorSFT that can increase the training effectiveness, and reduce the discrepancy between the optimized LLM and original LLM.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |

However, sourcing this data through human annotation is costly, and existing automated methods often fail to capture the diverse range of contextual granularity and tend to produce homogeneous data. To tackle these issues, we introduce a novel method named AugCon, capable of automatically generating context-driven SFT data across multiple levels of granularity with high diversity, quality and fidelity. AugCon begins by generating queries using the Context-Split-Tree (CST), an innovative approach for recursively deriving queries and splitting context to cover full granularity. Then, we train a scorer through contrastive learning to collaborate with CST to rank and refine queries. Finally, a synergistic integration of self-alignment and self-improving is introduced to obtain high-fidelity responses. Extensive experiments are conducted incorporating both human and automatic evaluations, encompassing a test scenario and four widely-used benchmarks in English and Chinese. The results highlight the significant advantages of AugCon in producing high diversity, quality, and fidelity SFT data against several state-of-the-art methods. All of our code, dataset, and fine-tuned model will be available at: https://github.com/quanshr/AugCon.</p></details> |  |

It typically consists of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) stages. However, RLHF faces inherent limitations stemming from a complex training setup and its tendency to align the model with implicit values that end users cannot control at run-time. Moreover, reward models in RLHF stage commonly rely on single-dimensional feedback as opposed to explicit, multifaceted signals that indicate attributes such as helpfulness, humor, and toxicity. To address these limitations, we propose SteerLM, a supervised fine-tuning method that empowers end-users to control responses during inference. SteerLM conditions responses to conform to an explicitly defined multi-dimensional set of attributes, thereby empowering a steerable AI capable of generating helpful and high-quality responses while maintaining customizability. Experiments show that SteerLM trained on open source datasets generates responses that are preferred by human and automatic evaluators to many state-of-the-art baselines trained with RLHF while being much easier to train.

However, as the number of cascades increases, the improvements in reconstruction tend to become marginal, indicating possible excess model capacity. Knowledge distillation (KD) is an emerging technique to compress these models, in which a trained deep teacher network is used to distill knowledge to a smaller student network such that the student learns to mimic the behavior of the teacher. Most KD methods focus on effectively training the student with a pre-trained teacher unaware of the student model. We propose SFT-KD-Recon, a student-friendly teacher training approach along with the student as a prior step to KD to make the teacher aware of the structure and capacity of the student and enable aligning the representations of the teacher with the student. In SFT, the teacher is jointly trained with the unfolded branch configurations of the student blocks using three loss terms - teacher-reconstruction loss, student-reconstruction loss, and teacher-student imitation loss, followed by KD of the student. We perform extensive experiments for MRI acceleration in 4x and 5x under-sampling on the brain and cardiac datasets on five KD methods using the proposed approach as a prior step. We consider the DC-CNN architecture and setup teacher as D5C5 (141765 parameters), and student as D3C5 (49285 parameters), denoting a compression of 2.87:1. Results show that (i) our approach consistently improves the KD methods with improved reconstruction performance and image quality, and (ii) the student distilled using our approach is competitive with the teacher, with the performance gap reduced from 0.53 dB to 0.03 dB.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 8 figures.

In particular we prove that all generalized Baumslag-Solitar groups (GBS) admit a strongly aperiodic SFT. Our proof is based on a structural theorem by Whyte and on two constructions of strongly aperiodic SFTs on $\mathbb{F}_n\times \mathbb{Z}$ and $BS(m,n)$ of our own. Our two constructions rely on a path-folding technique that lifts an SFT on $\mathbb{Z}^2$ inside an SFT on $\mathbb{F}_n\times \mathbb{Z}$ or an SFT on the hyperbolic plane inside an SFT on $BS(m,n)$. In the case of $\mathbb{F}_n\times \mathbb{Z}$ the path folding technique also preserves minimality, so that we get minimal strongly aperiodic SFTs on unimodular GBS groups.</p></details> | 31 pages, 13 figures |

As a consequence, if $P$ contains a recursive member, $P$ and $X$ have the exact same set of Turing degrees. On the other hand, we prove that if $X$ contains only non-recursive members, some of its members always have different but comparable degrees. This gives a fairly complete study of Turing degrees of SFTs.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1102.1189</p></details> |

However, due to privacy concerns, users may be reluctant to share sensitive preference data. To address this, we propose utilizing Federated Learning (FL) techniques, allowing large-scale preference collection from diverse real-world users without requiring them to transmit data to a central server. Our federated RLHF methods (i.e., FedBis and FedBiscuit) encode each client's preferences into binary selectors and aggregate them to capture common preferences. In particular, FedBiscuit overcomes key challenges, such as preference heterogeneity and reward hacking, through innovative solutions like grouping clients with similar preferences to reduce heterogeneity and using multiple binary selectors to enhance LLM output quality. To evaluate the performance of the proposed methods, we establish the first federated RLHF benchmark with a heterogeneous human preference dataset. Experimental results show that by integrating the LLM with aggregated client preferences, FedBis and FedBiscuit significantly enhance the professionalism and readability of the generated content.</p></details> | ICLR'25 |

However, existing reward models lack this ability, as they are typically trained by increasing the reward gap between chosen and rejected responses, while overlooking the prompts that the responses are conditioned on. Consequently, when the trained reward model is evaluated on prompt-response pairs that lie outside the data distribution, neglecting the effect of prompts may result in poor generalization of the reward model. To address this issue, we decompose the reward value into two independent components: prompt-free reward and prompt-related reward. Prompt-free reward represents the evaluation that is determined only by responses, while the prompt-related reward reflects the reward that derives from both the prompt and the response. We extract these two components from an information-theoretic perspective, which requires no extra models. Subsequently, we propose a new reward learning algorithm by prioritizing data samples based on their prompt-free reward values. Through toy examples, we demonstrate that the extracted prompt-free and prompt-related rewards effectively characterize two parts of the reward model. Further, standard evaluations show that our method improves both the alignment performance and the generalization capability of the reward model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Work ...</summary><p>Work done during internships at Institute of Artificial Intelligence (TeleAI), China Telecom</p></details> |

A Policy Coverage Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19255v2)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sample efficiency is critical for online Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). While existing works investigate sample-efficient online exploration strategies, the potential of utilizing misspecified yet relevant reward models to accelerate learning remains underexplored. This paper studies how to transfer knowledge from those imperfect reward models in online RLHF. We start by identifying a novel property of the KL-regularized RLHF objective: \emph{a policy's coverability of the optimal policy is captured by its sub-optimality}. Building on this insight, we propose novel transfer learning principles and a theoretical algorithm with provable benefits compared to standard online learning. Our approach achieves low regret in the early stage by quickly adapting to the best available source reward models without prior knowledge of their quality, and over time, it attains an $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret bound \emph{independent} of structural complexity measures. Empirically, inspired by our theoretical findings, we develop a win-rate-based transfer policy selection method with improved computational efficiency. Moreover, our empirical transfer learning technique is modular and can be integrated with various policy optimization methods, such as DPO, IPO and XPO, to further enhance their performance. We validate the effectiveness of our method through experiments on summarization tasks.</p></details> | 36 Pages |
| **[A Unified Pairwise Framework for RLHF: Bridging Generative Reward Modeling and Policy Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04950v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a important paradigm for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences during post-training. This framework typically involves two stages: first, training a reward model on human preference data, followed by optimizing the language model using reinforcement learning algorithms. However, current RLHF approaches may constrained by two limitations. First, existing RLHF frameworks often rely on Bradley-Terry models to assign scalar rewards based on pairwise comparisons of individual responses. However, this approach imposes significant challenges on reward model (RM), as the inherent variability in prompt-response pairs across different contexts demands robust calibration capabilities from the RM. Second, reward models are typically initialized from generative foundation models, such as pre-trained or supervised fine-tuned models, despite the fact that reward models perform discriminative tasks, creating a mismatch. This paper introduces Pairwise-RL, a RLHF framework that addresses these challenges through a combination of generative reward modeling and a pairwise proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm. Pairwise-RL unifies reward model training and its application during reinforcement learning within a consistent pairwise paradigm, leveraging generative modeling techniques to enhance reward model performance and score calibration. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that Pairwise-RL outperforms traditional RLHF frameworks across both internal evaluation datasets and standard public benchmarks, underscoring its effectiveness in improving alignment and model behavior.</p></details> | 11oages,2 figures |

While state-of-the-art applications like ChatGPT/GPT-4 commonly employ Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), the inclusion of a critic network introduces significant computational overhead. REINFORCE-based methods, such as REINFORCE Leave One-Out (RLOO), ReMax, and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), address this limitation by eliminating the critic network. However, these approaches face challenges in accurate advantage estimation. Specifically, they estimate advantages independently for responses to each prompt, which can lead to overfitting on simpler prompts and vulnerability to reward hacking. To address these challenges, we introduce REINFORCE++, a novel approach that removes the critic model while using the normalized reward of a batch as the baseline. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that REINFORCE++ exhibits robust performance across various reward models without requiring prompt set truncation. Furthermore, it achieves superior generalization in both RLHF and long chain-of-thought (CoT) settings compared to existing REINFORCE-based methods.

To solve this problem, alignment techniques such as RLHF, DPO and KTO are proposed. However, these alignment techniques have limitations. For example, RLHF requires training the reward model and policy separately, which is complex, time-consuming, memory intensive and unstable during training processes. DPO proposes a mapping between an optimal policy and a reward, greatly simplifying the training process of RLHF. However, it can not take full advantages of a reward model and it is limited to pairwise preference data. In this paper, we propose \textbf{UN}ified \textbf{A}lignment (UNA) which unifies RLHF/PPO, DPO and KTO. Firstly, we mathematically prove that given the classical RLHF objective, the optimal policy is induced by a generalize implicit reward function. With this novel mapping between a reward model and an optimal policy, UNA can 1. unify RLHF/PPO, DPO and KTO into a supervised learning of minimizing the difference between an implicit reward and an explicit reward; 2. outperform RLHF/PPO while simplify, stabilize, speed up and reduce memory burden of RL fine-tuning process; 3. accommodate different feedback types including pairwise, binary and scalar feedback. Downstream experiments show UNA outperforms DPO, KTO and RLHF.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sharpe Ratio-Guided Active Learning for Preference Optimization in RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22137v1)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has become a cornerstone of the training and alignment pipeline for large language models (LLMs). Recent advances, such as direct preference optimization (DPO), have simplified the preference learning step. However, collecting preference data remains a challenging and costly process, often requiring expert annotation. This cost can be mitigated by carefully selecting the data points presented for annotation. In this work, we propose an active learning approach to efficiently select prompt and preference pairs using a risk assessment strategy based on the Sharpe Ratio. To address the challenge of unknown preferences prior to annotation, our method evaluates the gradients of all potential preference annotations to assess their impact on model updates. These gradient-based evaluations enable risk assessment of data points regardless of the annotation outcome. By leveraging the DPO loss derivations, we derive a closed-form expression for computing these Sharpe ratios on a per-tuple basis, ensuring our approach remains both tractable and computationally efficient. We also introduce two variants of our method, each making different assumptions about prior information. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the baseline by up to 5% in win rates against the chosen completion with limited human preference data across several language models and real-world datasets.</p></details> |  |

We begin with a concise overview of the typical steps involved in RLHF and LRMs. Next, we reinterpret several RL-based and RL-free algorithms through the perspective of neural structured bandit prediction, providing a clear conceptual framework that uncovers a deeper connection between these seemingly distinct approaches. Following this, we briefly review some core principles of reinforcement learning, drawing attention to an often-overlooked aspect in existing RLHF studies. This leads to a detailed derivation of the standard RLHF objective within a full RL context, demonstrating its equivalence to neural structured bandit prediction. Finally, by reinvestigating the principles behind Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), we pinpoint areas needing adjustment, which culminates in the introduction of the Generalized Reinforce Optimization (GRO) framework, seamlessly integrating RL-based and RL-free methods in RLHF. We look forward to the community's efforts to empirically validate GRO and invite constructive feedback.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Shared Low-Rank Adaptation Approach to Personalized RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19201v1)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a pivotal technique for aligning artificial intelligence systems with human values, achieving remarkable success in fine-tuning large language models. However, existing RLHF frameworks often assume that human preferences are relatively homogeneous and can be captured by a single, unified reward model. This assumption overlooks the inherent diversity and heterogeneity across individuals, limiting the adaptability of RLHF to personalized scenarios and risking misalignments that can diminish user satisfaction and trust in AI systems. In this paper, we address these challenges by introducing Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) into the personalized RLHF framework. We apply LoRA in the the aggregated parameter space of all personalized reward functions, thereby enabling efficient learning of personalized reward models from potentially limited local datasets. Our approach exploits potential shared structures among the local ground-truth reward models while allowing for individual adaptation, without relying on restrictive assumptions about shared representations as in prior works. We further establish sample complexity guarantees for our method. Theoretical analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach in capturing both shared and individual-specific structures within heterogeneous human preferences, addressing the dual challenge of personalization requirements and practical data constraints. Experimental results on real-world datasets corroborate the efficiency of our algorithm in the personalized RLHF setting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at AISTATS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Mitigating Reward Over-Optimization in RLHF via Behavior-Supported Regularization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18130v1)** | 2025-03-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is an effective method for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values. However, reward over-optimization remains an open challenge leading to discrepancies between the performance of LLMs under the reward model and the true human objectives. A primary contributor to reward over-optimization is the extrapolation error that arises when the reward model evaluates out-of-distribution (OOD) responses. However, current methods still fail to prevent the increasing frequency of OOD response generation during the reinforcement learning (RL) process and are not effective at handling extrapolation errors from OOD responses. In this work, we propose the Behavior-Supported Policy Optimization (BSPO) method to mitigate the reward over-optimization issue. Specifically, we define behavior policy as the next token distribution of the reward training dataset to model the in-distribution (ID) region of the reward model. Building on this, we introduce the behavior-supported Bellman operator to regularize the value function, penalizing all OOD values without impacting the ID ones. Consequently, BSPO reduces the generation of OOD responses during the RL process, thereby avoiding overestimation caused by the reward model's extrapolation errors. Theoretically, we prove that BSPO guarantees a monotonic improvement of the supported policy until convergence to the optimal behavior-supported policy. Empirical results from extensive experiments show that BSPO outperforms baselines in preventing reward over-optimization due to OOD evaluation and finding the optimal ID policy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Understanding the Effects of RLHF on the Quality and Detectability of LLM-Generated Texts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17965v1)** | 2025-03-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance on a range of downstream NLP tasks by generating text that closely resembles human writing. However, the ease of achieving this similarity raises concerns from potential malicious uses at scale by bad actors, as LLM-generated text becomes increasingly difficult to discern from human text. Although detection methods have been developed to address this issue, bad actors can further manipulate LLM-generated texts to make them less detectable. In this work, we study how further editing texts with Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), which aligns model outputs with human preferences, affects (a) the quality of generated texts for two tasks, and (b) the performance of LLM-generated text detectors, looking at both training-based and zero-shot detection methods. Although RLHF improves the quality of LLM-generated texts, we find that it also tends to produce more detectable, lengthy, and repetitive outputs. Additionally, we observe that training-based detectors are vulnerable to short texts and to texts that incorporate code, whereas zero-shot detectors exhibit greater robustness.</p></details> | 14 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Asynchronous RLHF: Faster and More Efficient Off-Policy RL for Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18252v2)** | 2025-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The dominant paradigm for RLHF is online and on-policy RL: synchronously generating from the large language model (LLM) policy, labelling with a reward model, and learning using feedback on the LLM's own outputs. While performant, this paradigm is computationally inefficient. Inspired by classical deep RL literature, we propose separating generation and learning in RLHF. This enables asynchronous generation of new samples while simultaneously training on old samples, leading to faster training and more compute-optimal scaling. However, asynchronous training relies on an underexplored regime, online but off-policy RLHF: learning on samples from previous iterations of our model which give a worse training signal. We tackle the fundamental challenge in this regime: how much off-policyness can we tolerate for asynchronous training to speed up learning but maintain performance? Among several RLHF algorithms we test, online DPO is found to be most robust to off-policy data, and robustness increases with the scale of the policy model. We study further compute optimizations for asynchronous RLHF but find that they come at a performance cost, giving rise to a trade-off. We verify the scalability of asynchronous RLHF by training a general-purpose chatbot from LLaMA 3.1 8B on an instruction-following task ~40% faster than a synchronous run while matching final performance. Finally, we extend our results to math and reasoning to demonstrate asynchronous RL can finetune Rho 1B on GSM8k ~70% faster while matching synchronous accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>code ...</summary><p>code at https://github.com/mnoukhov/async_rlhf</p></details> |
| **[Aligning to What? Limits to RLHF Based Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09025v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is increasingly used to align large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. However, the effectiveness of RLHF in addressing underlying biases remains unclear. This study investigates the relationship between RLHF and both covert and overt biases in LLMs, particularly focusing on biases against African Americans. We applied various RLHF techniques (DPO, ORPO, and RLOO) to Llama 3 8B and evaluated the covert and overt biases of the resulting models using matched-guise probing and explicit bias testing. We performed additional tests with DPO on different base models and datasets; among several implications, we found that SFT before RLHF calcifies model biases. Additionally, we extend the tools for measuring biases to multi-modal models. Through our experiments we collect evidence that indicates that current alignment techniques are inadequate for nebulous tasks such as mitigating covert biases, highlighting the need for capable datasets, data curating techniques, or alignment tools.</p></details> |  |
| **[ROCM: RLHF on consistency models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06171v1)** | 2025-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have revolutionized generative modeling in continuous domains like image, audio, and video synthesis. However, their iterative sampling process leads to slow generation and inefficient training, challenges that are further exacerbated when incorporating Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) due to sparse rewards and long time horizons. Consistency models address these issues by enabling single-step or efficient multi-step generation, significantly reducing computational costs. In this work, we propose a direct reward optimization framework for applying RLHF to consistency models, incorporating distributional regularization to enhance training stability and prevent reward hacking. We investigate various $f$-divergences as regularization strategies, striking a balance between reward maximization and model consistency. Unlike policy gradient methods, our approach leverages first-order gradients, making it more efficient and less sensitive to hyperparameter tuning. Empirical results show that our method achieves competitive or superior performance compared to policy gradient based RLHF methods, across various automatic metrics and human evaluation. Additionally, our analysis demonstrates the impact of different regularization techniques in improving model generalization and preventing overfitting.</p></details> |  |
| **[On a Connection Between Imitation Learning and RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05079v1)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work studies the alignment of large language models with preference data from an imitation learning perspective. We establish a close theoretical connection between reinforcement learning from human feedback RLHF and imitation learning (IL), revealing that RLHF implicitly performs imitation learning on the preference data distribution. Building on this connection, we propose DIL, a principled framework that directly optimizes the imitation learning objective. DIL provides a unified imitation learning perspective on alignment, encompassing existing alignment algorithms as special cases while naturally introducing new variants. By bridging IL and RLHF, DIL offers new insights into alignment with RLHF. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DIL outperforms existing methods on various challenging benchmarks.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |
| **[LLM Misalignment via Adversarial RLHF Platforms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03039v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning has shown remarkable performance in aligning language models with human preferences, leading to the rise of attention towards developing RLHF platforms. These platforms enable users to fine-tune models without requiring any expertise in developing complex machine learning algorithms. While these platforms offer useful features such as reward modeling and RLHF fine-tuning, their security and reliability remain largely unexplored. Given the growing adoption of RLHF and open-source RLHF frameworks, we investigate the trustworthiness of these systems and their potential impact on behavior of LLMs. In this paper, we present an attack targeting publicly available RLHF tools. In our proposed attack, an adversarial RLHF platform corrupts the LLM alignment process by selectively manipulating data samples in the preference dataset. In this scenario, when a user's task aligns with the attacker's objective, the platform manipulates a subset of the preference dataset that contains samples related to the attacker's target. This manipulation results in a corrupted reward model, which ultimately leads to the misalignment of the language model. Our results demonstrate that such an attack can effectively steer LLMs toward undesirable behaviors within the targeted domains. Our work highlights the critical need to explore the vulnerabilities of RLHF platforms and their potential to cause misalignment in LLMs during the RLHF fine-tuning process.</p></details> |  |
| **[Taming Overconfidence in LLMs: Reward Calibration in RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09724v2)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language model calibration refers to the alignment between the confidence of the model and the actual performance of its responses. While previous studies point out the overconfidence phenomenon in Large Language Models (LLMs) and show that LLMs trained with Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) are overconfident with a more sharpened output probability, in this study, we reveal that RLHF tends to lead models to express verbalized overconfidence in their own responses. We investigate the underlying cause of this overconfidence and demonstrate that reward models used for Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) exhibit inherent biases towards high-confidence scores regardless of the actual quality of responses. Building upon this insight, we propose two PPO variants: PPO-M: PPO with Calibrated Reward Modeling and PPO-C: PPO with Calibrated Reward Calculation. PPO-M integrates explicit confidence scores in reward model training, which calibrates reward models to better capture the alignment between response quality and verbalized confidence. PPO-C adjusts the reward score during PPO based on the difference between the current reward and the exponential average of past rewards. Both PPO-M and PPO-C can be seamlessly integrated into the current PPO pipeline and do not require additional golden labels. We evaluate our methods on both Llama3-8B and Mistral-7B across six diverse datasets including multiple-choice and open-ended generation. Experimental results demonstrate that both of our methods can reduce calibration error and maintain performance comparable to standard PPO. We further show that they could preserve model capabilities in open-ended conversational settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reward Shaping to Mitigate Reward Hacking in RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18770v2)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is essential for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values. However, RLHF is susceptible to reward hacking, where the agent exploits flaws in the reward function rather than learning the intended behavior, thus degrading alignment. While reward shaping helps stabilize RLHF and partially mitigate reward hacking, a systematic investigation into shaping techniques and their underlying principles remains lacking. To bridge this gap, we present a comprehensive study of the prevalent reward shaping methods. Our analysis suggests three key design principles: (1) RL reward is ideally bounded, (2) RL benefits from rapid initial growth followed by gradual convergence, and (3) RL reward is best formulated as a function of centered reward. Guided by these insights, we propose Preference As Reward (PAR), a novel approach that leverages the latent preferences embedded within the reward model itself as the signal for reinforcement learning. We evaluated PAR on two base models, Gemma2-2B and Llama3-8B, using two datasets, Ultrafeedback-Binarized and HH-RLHF. Experimental results demonstrate PAR's superior performance over other reward shaping methods. On the AlpacaEval 2.0 benchmark, PAR achieves a win rate at least 5 percentage points higher than competing approaches. Furthermore, PAR exhibits remarkable data efficiency, requiring only a single reference reward for optimal performance, and maintains robustness against reward hacking even after two full epochs of training. Code is available at https://github.com/PorUna-byte/PAR.</p></details> | 19 pages |
| **[Evaluating Defences against Unsafe Feedback in RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12914v3)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While there has been progress towards aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human values and ensuring safe behaviour at inference time, safety guards can easily be removed when fine tuned on unsafe and harmful datasets. While this setting has been treated extensively, another popular training paradigm, learning from unsafe feedback with reinforcement learning, has previously been unexplored. This is concerning due to the widespread deployment of feedback collection systems. We address this gap by providing an analysis of learning settings where feedback is harmful, i.e. that unsafe samples are preferred over safe ones despite model developers goal to maintain safety. We find that safety-aligned LLMs easily explore unsafe action spaces via generating harmful text and optimize for reward that violates safety constraints indicating that current safety guards are not enough to prevent learning from unsafe feedback. In order to protect against this vulnerability, we adapt a number of both "implict" and "explicit" harmful fine-tuning defences to evaluate whether they are effective as learning constraints in an RLHF setting finding that no method is generally effective pointing to the need for more defence research. We end the paper with the observation that some defences work by performing "harmless reward hacking" for which we provide a theoretical explanation drawn from the theory of Constrained Markov Decision Processes and provide some direction for future defence development.</p></details> |  |
| **[Projection Optimization: A General Framework for Multi-Objective and Multi-Group RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15145v2)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) is a widely used fine-tuning approach that aligns machine learning model, particularly Language Model (LM) with human preferences. There are typically multiple objectives driving the preference, hence humans find it easier to express per-objective comparisons rather than a global preference between two choices. Multi-Objective RLHF (MORLHF) aims to use per-objective preference feedback and achieve Pareto optimality among these objectives by aggregating them into a single unified objective for optimization. However, nearly all prior works rely on linear aggregation, which rules out policies that favor specific objectives such as the worst one. The only existing approach using non-linear aggregation is computationally expensive due to its reward-based nature and the need for retraining whenever the aggregation parameters change. In this work, we address this limitation by transforming the non-linear aggregation maximization problem into a series of sub-problems. Each sub-problem involves only linear aggregation, making it computationally efficient to solve. We further extend our framework to handle multi-group scenarios, where each group has distinct weights for the objectives. Our method enables achieving consensus or maximizing the aggregated objective across all groups. Theoretically, we demonstrate that our algorithmic framework achieves sublinear regret and can be easily adapted to a reward-free algorithm. Empirically, leveraging our theoretical insights, we propose a nearly training-free algorithm once the optimal policies for individual objectives are obtained.</p></details> |  |
| **[Simplify RLHF as Reward-Weighted SFT: A Variational Method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11026v2)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is crucial for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human values. However, RLHF has been continuously challenged by its high complexity in implementation and computation consumption. Even with recent simplifications, such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Advantage Leftover Lunch (A-LoL), the problems of over-fitting and training instability remain hindering the alignment process from the expected optimal performance. To address the existing challenges, we propose a novel simplification of RLHF from the perspective of variational inference, called $\textbf{V}$ariational $\textbf{A}$lignment with $\textbf{R}$e-weighting ($\textbf{VAR}$). More specifically, by directly minimizing the distribution gap between the learning LLM policy and the optimal solution of RLHF, we transform the alignment objective into a reward-driven re-weighted supervised fine-tuning (SFT) form, which only requires minor adjustment on the SFT loss to obtain noticeable improvement on training stability and effectiveness. On comprehensive alignment and generation benchmarks, our VAR method has numerically achieved competitive performance in LLM alignment helpfulness and harmlessness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Value-Incentivized Preference Optimization: A Unified Approach to Online and Offline RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19320v4)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has demonstrated great promise in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preference. Depending on the availability of preference data, both online and offline RLHF are active areas of investigation. A key bottleneck is understanding how to incorporate uncertainty estimation in the reward function learned from the preference data for RLHF, regardless of how the preference data is collected. While the principles of optimism or pessimism under uncertainty are well-established in standard reinforcement learning (RL), a practically-implementable and theoretically-grounded form amenable to large language models is not yet available, as standard techniques for constructing confidence intervals become intractable under arbitrary policy parameterizations. In this paper, we introduce a unified approach to online and offline RLHF -- value-incentivized preference optimization (VPO) -- which regularizes the maximum-likelihood estimate of the reward function with the corresponding value function, modulated by a $\textit{sign}$ to indicate whether the optimism or pessimism is chosen. VPO also directly optimizes the policy with implicit reward modeling, and therefore shares a simpler RLHF pipeline similar to direct preference optimization. Theoretical guarantees of VPO are provided for both online and offline settings, matching the rates of their standard RL counterparts. Moreover, experiments on text summarization and dialog verify the practicality and effectiveness of VPO.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

It has been shown to enhance both generation quality and trustworthiness. While numerous works have focused on improving retrieval, generation, and evaluation, the role of reward models in reinforcement learning for optimizing RAG remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{RAG-Reward}, a framework designed to develop reward models to enable \textit{hallucination-free, comprehensive, reliable, and efficient RAG}. We define four key metrics to assess generation quality and develop an automated benchmarking pipeline to evaluate the outputs of multiple LLMs across a variety of RAG scenarios. Using \textbf{RAG-Reward}, we train reward models and apply {reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF)} to improve LLMs' effectiveness in RAG. Experimental results demonstrate that our reward model achieves state-of-the-art performance in automatic benchmarking and aligns closely with human evaluations. Furthermore, the improved generation quality of the trained policy model highlights the feasibility and efficiency of using RLHF to enhance RAG outputs.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Equilibrate RLHF: Towards Balancing Helpfulness-Safety Trade-off in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11555v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) based on human preferences, commonly achieved through reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), has been effective in improving their performance. However, maintaining LLM safety throughout the fine-tuning process remains a significant challenge, as resolving conflicts between safety and helpfulness can be non-trivial. Typically, the safety alignment of LLM is trained on data with safety-related categories. However, our experiments find that naively increasing the scale of safety training data usually leads the LLMs to an ``overly safe'' state rather than a ``truly safe'' state, boosting the refusal rate through extensive safety-aligned data without genuinely understanding the requirements for safe responses. Such an approach can inadvertently diminish the models' helpfulness. To understand the phenomenon, we first investigate the role of safety data by categorizing them into three different groups, and observe that each group behaves differently as training data scales up. To boost the balance between safety and helpfulness, we propose an Equilibrate RLHF framework including a Fine-grained Data-centric (FDC) approach that achieves better safety alignment even with fewer training data, and an Adaptive Message-wise Alignment (AMA) approach, which selectively highlight the key segments through a gradient masking strategy. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances the safety alignment of LLMs while balancing safety and helpfulness.</p></details> |  |
| **[DPO Meets PPO: Reinforced Token Optimization for RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18922v3)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the classical Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) framework, Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is employed to learn from sparse, sentence-level rewards -- a challenging scenario in traditional deep reinforcement learning. Despite the great successes of PPO in the alignment of large language models, its open-source implementation is still largely sub-optimal. To address these issues, we introduce a framework that models RLHF problems as a Markov decision process (MDP), enabling the capture of fine-grained token-wise information. Under this framework, we introduce an algorithm Reinforced Token Optimization (\texttt{RTO}), which learns the token-wise reward function from preference data and performs policy optimization based on this learned token-wise reward signal. Theoretically, \texttt{RTO} is proven to have the capability of finding the near-optimal policy sample-efficiently. For its practical implementation, \texttt{RTO} innovatively integrates Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and PPO. DPO, originally derived from sparse sentence rewards, surprisingly provides us with a token-wise characterization of response quality, which is seamlessly incorporated into our subsequent PPO training stage. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \texttt{RTO} performs better than PPO and other direct preference learning algorithms. In particular, RTO outperforms PPO by 7.5 points on the AlpacaEval 2 benchmark and by 4.1 points on Arena-Hard. Our code and models are available at \href{https://github.com/zkshan2002/RTO}{https://github.com/zkshan2002/RTO}.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sharp Analysis for KL-Regularized Contextual Bandits and RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04625v2)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reverse-Kullback-Leibler (KL) regularization has emerged to be a predominant technique used to enhance policy optimization in reinforcement learning (RL) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), which forces the learned policy to stay close to a reference policy. While the effectiveness and necessity of KL-regularization have been empirically demonstrated in various practical scenarios, current theoretical analysis of KL-regularized RLHF still obtains the same $\mathcal{O}(1 / \epsilon^2)$ sample complexity as problems without KL-regularization. To understand the fundamental distinction between policy learning objectives with KL-regularization and ones without KL-regularization, we are the first to theoretically demonstrate the power of KL-regularization by providing a sharp analysis for KL-regularized contextual bandits and RLHF, revealing an $\mathcal{O}(1 / \epsilon)$ sample complexity when $\epsilon$ is sufficiently small. We further explore the role of data coverage in contextual bandits and RLHF. While the coverage assumption is commonly employed in offline RLHF to link the samples from the reference policy to the optimal policy, often at the cost of a multiplicative dependence on the coverage coefficient, its impact on the sample complexity of online RLHF remains unclear. Previous theoretical analyses of online RLHF typically require explicit exploration and additional structural assumptions on the reward function class. In contrast, we show that with sufficient coverage from the reference policy, a simple two-stage mixed sampling strategy can achieve a sample complexity with only an additive dependence on the coverage coefficient. Our results provide a comprehensive understanding of the roles of KL-regularization and data coverage in RLHF, shedding light on the design of more efficient RLHF algorithms.</p></details> |  |

While recent advancements have provided valuable insights into various stages and settings of RLHF, a comprehensive theoretical understanding of the entire RLHF pipeline remains lacking. Towards this end, we propose a unified framework for the RLHF pipeline from the view of contextual bandits and provide provable efficiency guarantees. In particular, we decompose the RLHF process into two distinct stages: (post-)training and deployment, exploring both passive and active data collection strategies during the training phase. By employing the Bradley-Terry preference model with a linearly parameterized reward function, we reformulate RLHF as a contextual preference bandit problem. We then develop novel algorithms for each stage, demonstrating significant improvements over existing approaches in both statistical and computational efficiency. Finally, we apply our method to train and deploy Llama-3-8B-Instruct on the Ultrafeedback-binarized dataset, and empirical results confirm the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[RLHS: Mitigating Misalignment in RLHF with Hindsight Simulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08617v2)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has shown promise in aligning generative AI, we present empirical evidence that it can also cause severe, systematic misalignment. We hypothesize that this stems from evaluator feedback depending on downstream outcome predictions (foresight) that can be influenced by the AI's output, inducing Goodhart's law dynamics. Conversely, our theoretical analysis shows that conditioning evaluator feedback on downstream observations (hindsight) inhibits this effect by decoupling the alignment signal from potentially compromised predictions-crucially, the result holds even if the observed outcomes are sampled from the AI's own world model. Building on this insight, we introduce Reinforcement Learning from Hindsight Simulation (RLHS), which presents plausible simulated outcomes to evaluators before eliciting feedback. We demonstrate RLHS on online (PPO) and offline (DPO) large language model fine-tuning, obtaining superior alignment over RLHF in controlled consultancy-type experiments and user studies. We evaluate post-hoc on the TruthfulQA benchmark and find that, even after single-task fine-tuning, both RLHF misalignment and RLHS alignment carry over to substantially different settings.</p></details> | 24 pages, 18 figures |
| **[Avoiding $\mathbf{exp(R_{max})}$ scaling in RLHF through Preference-based Exploration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00666v2)** | 2025-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a pivotal technique for large language model (LLM) alignment. This paper studies the setting of online RLHF and focus on improving sample efficiency. All existing algorithms in online RLHF, whether doing passive exploration or active exploration, suffer from a sample complexity that scales exponentially with the scale of the reward function. This fundamental limitation hinders their effectiveness in scenarios with heavily skewed preferences, e.g. questions with a unique correct solution. To address this, we introduce Self-Exploring Preference-Incentive Online Preference Optimization (SE-POPO), an online RLHF algorithm that for the first time achieves a sample complexity that scales polynomially with the reward scale, answering an open problem raised by Xie et al. (2024).. Theoretically, we demonstrate that the sample complexity of SE-POPO dominates that of existing exploration algorithms. Empirically, our systematic evaluation confirms that SE-POPO is more sample-efficient than both exploratory and non-exploratory baselines, in two primary application scenarios of RLHF as well as on public benchmarks, marking a significant step forward in RLHF algorithm design. The code is available at https://github.com/MYC000801/SE-POPO.</p></details> |  |
| **[Influencing Humans to Conform to Preference Models for RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06416v2)** | 2025-02-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Designing a reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) algorithm to approximate a human's unobservable reward function requires assuming, implicitly or explicitly, a model of human preferences. A preference model that poorly describes how humans generate preferences risks learning a poor approximation of the human's reward function. In this paper, we conduct three human studies to asses whether one can influence the expression of real human preferences to more closely conform to a desired preference model. Importantly, our approach does not seek to alter the human's unobserved reward function. Rather, we change how humans use this reward function to generate preferences, such that they better match whatever preference model is assumed by a particular RLHF algorithm. We introduce three interventions: showing humans the quantities that underlie a preference model, which is normally unobservable information derived from the reward function; training people to follow a specific preference model; and modifying the preference elicitation question. All intervention types show significant effects, providing practical tools to improve preference data quality and the resultant alignment of the learned reward functions. Overall we establish a novel research direction in model alignment: designing interfaces and training interventions to increase human conformance with the modeling assumptions of the algorithm that will learn from their input.</p></details> |  |

We introduce Federated Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (FedRLHF), a novel framework that decentralizes the RLHF process. FedRLHF enables collaborative policy learning across multiple clients without necessitating the sharing of raw data or human feedback, thereby ensuring robust privacy preservation. Leveraging federated reinforcement learning, each client integrates human feedback locally into their reward functions and updates their policies through personalized RLHF processes. We establish rigorous theoretical foundations for FedRLHF, providing convergence guarantees, and deriving sample complexity bounds that scale efficiently with the number of clients. Empirical evaluations on the MovieLens and IMDb datasets demonstrate that FedRLHF not only preserves user privacy but also achieves performance on par with centralized RLHF, while enhancing personalization across diverse client environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Updated for AAMAS 2025 camera-ready.

| **[The Energy Loss Phenomenon in RLHF: A New Perspective on Mitigating Reward Hacking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19358v2)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work identifies the Energy Loss Phenomenon in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and its connection to reward hacking. Specifically, energy loss in the final layer of a Large Language Model (LLM) gradually increases during the RL process, with an excessive increase in energy loss characterizing reward hacking. Beyond empirical analysis, we further provide a theoretical foundation by proving that, under mild conditions, the increased energy loss reduces the upper bound of contextual relevance in LLMs, which is a critical aspect of reward hacking as the reduced contextual relevance typically indicates overfitting to reward model-favored patterns in RL. To address this issue, we propose an Energy loss-aware PPO algorithm (EPPO) which penalizes the increase in energy loss in the LLM's final layer during reward calculation to prevent excessive energy loss, thereby mitigating reward hacking. We theoretically show that EPPO can be conceptually interpreted as an entropy-regularized RL algorithm, which provides deeper insights into its effectiveness. Extensive experiments across various LLMs and tasks demonstrate the commonality of the energy loss phenomenon, as well as the effectiveness of EPPO in mitigating reward hacking and improving RLHF performance.</p></details> | 28 pages, 21 figures |
| **[Theoretical Analysis of KL-regularized RLHF with Multiple Reference Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01203v1)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent methods for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human feedback predominantly rely on a single reference model, which limits diversity, model overfitting, and underutilizes the wide range of available pre-trained models. Incorporating multiple reference models has the potential to address these limitations by broadening perspectives, reducing bias, and leveraging the strengths of diverse open-source LLMs. However, integrating multiple reference models into reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) frameworks poses significant theoretical challenges, particularly in reverse KL-regularization, where achieving exact solutions has remained an open problem. This paper presents the first \emph{exact solution} to the multiple reference model problem in reverse KL-regularized RLHF. We introduce a comprehensive theoretical framework that includes rigorous statistical analysis and provides sample complexity guarantees. Additionally, we extend our analysis to forward KL-regularized RLHF, offering new insights into sample complexity requirements in multiple reference scenarios. Our contributions lay the foundation for more advanced and adaptable LLM alignment techniques, enabling the effective use of multiple reference models. This work paves the way for developing alignment frameworks that are both theoretically sound and better suited to the challenges of modern AI ecosystems.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[Segmenting Text and Learning Their Rewards for Improved RLHF in Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02790v1)** | 2025-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has been widely adopted to align language models (LMs) with human preference. Prior RLHF works typically take a bandit formulation, which, though intuitive, ignores the sequential nature of LM generation and can suffer from the sparse reward issue. While recent works propose dense token-level RLHF, treating each token as an action may be oversubtle to proper reward assignment. In this paper, we seek to get the best of both by training and utilizing a segment-level reward model, which assigns a reward to each semantically complete text segment that spans over a short sequence of tokens. For reward learning, our method allows dynamic text segmentation and compatibility with standard sequence-preference datasets. For effective RL-based LM training against segment reward, we generalize the classical scalar bandit reward normalizers into location-aware normalizer functions and interpolate the segment reward for further densification. With these designs, our method performs competitively on three popular RLHF benchmarks for LM policy: AlpacaEval 2.0, Arena-Hard, and MT-Bench. Ablation studies are conducted to further demonstrate our method.</p></details> |  |

Automatic Analysis of Refusal Composition in IFT/RLHF Datasets and Refusal Behavior of Black-Box LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16974v1)** | 2024-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Refusals - instances where large language models (LLMs) decline or fail to fully execute user instructions - are crucial for both AI safety and AI capabilities and the reduction of hallucinations in particular. These behaviors are learned during post-training, especially in instruction fine-tuning (IFT) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). However, existing taxonomies and evaluation datasets for refusals are inadequate, often focusing solely on should-not-related (instead of cannot-related) categories, and lacking tools for auditing refusal content in black-box LLM outputs. We present a comprehensive framework for classifying LLM refusals: (a) a taxonomy of 16 refusal categories, (b) a human-annotated dataset of over 8,600 instances from publicly available IFT and RLHF datasets, (c) a synthetic dataset with 8,000 examples for each refusal category, and (d) classifiers trained for refusal classification. Our work enables precise auditing of refusal behaviors in black-box LLMs and automatic analyses of refusal patterns in large IFT and RLHF datasets. This facilitates the strategic adjustment of LLM refusals, contributing to the development of more safe and reliable LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024 Workshop SFLLM</p></details> |
| **[More RLHF, More Trust? On The Impact of Preference Alignment On Trustworthiness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18870v2)** | 2024-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The trustworthiness of Large Language Models (LLMs) refers to the extent to which their outputs are reliable, safe, and ethically aligned, and it has become a crucial consideration alongside their cognitive performance. In practice, Reinforcement Learning From Human Feedback (RLHF) has been widely used to align LLMs with labeled human preferences, but its assumed effect on model trustworthiness hasn't been rigorously evaluated. To bridge this knowledge gap, this study investigates how models aligned with general-purpose preference data perform across five trustworthiness verticals: toxicity, stereotypical bias, machine ethics, truthfulness, and privacy. Our results demonstrate that RLHF on human preferences doesn't automatically guarantee trustworthiness, and reverse effects are often observed. Furthermore, we propose to adapt efficient influence function based data attribution methods to the RLHF setting to better understand the influence of fine-tuning data on individual trustworthiness benchmarks, and show its feasibility by providing our estimated attribution scores. Together, our results underscore the need for more nuanced approaches for model alignment from both the data and framework perspectives, and we hope this research will guide the community towards developing language models that are increasingly capable without sacrificing trustworthiness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Solving the Inverse Alignment Problem for Efficient RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10529v1)** | 2024-12-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Collecting high-quality preference datasets for reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is resource-intensive and challenging. As a result, researchers often train reward models on extensive offline datasets which aggregate diverse generation sources and scoring/alignment policies. We hypothesize that this aggregation has an averaging effect on reward model scores, which limits signal and impairs the alignment process. Inspired by the field of inverse RL, we define the 'inverse alignment problem' in language model training, where our objective is to optimize the critic's reward for a fixed actor and a fixed offline preference dataset. We hypothesize that solving the inverse alignment problem will improve reward model quality by providing clearer feedback on the policy's current behavior. To that end, we investigate whether repeatedly fine-tuning a reward model on subsets of the offline preference dataset aligned with a periodically frozen policy during RLHF improves upon vanilla RLHF. Our empirical results demonstrate that this approach facilitates superior alignment and faster convergence compared to using an unaligned or out-of-distribution reward model relative to the LLM policy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Policy Filtration in RLHF to Fine-Tune LLM for Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06957v2)** | 2024-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is one of the key techniques that helps large language models (LLMs) to follow instructions and provide helpful and harmless responses. While direct policy optimization methods exist, state-of-the-art LLMs adopt RL-based methods (usually PPO) in RLHF to train the policy to generate good responses guided by a reward model learned from preference data. The main challenge of these methods is the inaccuracy of the intermediate reward model, especially in code generation tasks that require long and complex reasoning to score a response. We find that the reliability of the reward model varies across responses assigned with different rewards. This motivates us to filter the samples whose rewards may be unreliable to improve signal-to-noise ratio during policy learning, resulting in Policy Filtration for Proximal Policy Optimization (PF-PPO). To choose a proper policy filtration strategy for a given reward model, the coefficient of determination ($R^2$) between rewards and actual scores on filtered samples serves as a good metrics and helps us find several promising strategies. We provide extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of PF-PPO in code generation tasks, and find that some variants of PF-PPO are highly effective and achieve new state-of-the-art performance across 7-billion-parameter models on HumanEval, MBPP, and a new and more challenging LeetCode Contest benchmark.</p></details> |  |
| **[Does RLHF Scale? Exploring the Impacts From Data, Model, and Method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06000v1)** | 2024-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study explores the scaling properties of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) in Large Language Models (LLMs). Although RLHF is considered an important step in post-training of LLMs, its scaling potential is still largely unknown. We systematically analyze key components in the RLHF framework--model size, data composition, and inference budget--and their impacts on performance. Our findings show that increasing data diversity and volume improves reward model performance, helping process-supervision models scale better. For policy training, more response samples per prompt boost performance initially but quickly plateau. And larger reward models offer modest gains in policy training. In addition, larger policy models benefit less from RLHF with a fixed reward model. Overall, RLHF scales less efficiently than pretraining, with diminishing returns from additional computational resources. Based on these observations, we propose strategies to optimize RLHF performance within computational limits.</p></details> |  |
| **[Language Models Learn to Mislead Humans via RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12822v3)** | 2024-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language models (LMs) can produce errors that are hard to detect for humans, especially when the task is complex. RLHF, the most popular post-training method, may exacerbate this problem: to achieve higher rewards, LMs might get better at convincing humans that they are right even when they are wrong. We study this phenomenon under a standard RLHF pipeline, calling it "U-SOPHISTRY" since it is Unintended by model developers. Specifically, we ask time-constrained (e.g., 3-10 minutes) human subjects to evaluate the correctness of model outputs and calculate humans' accuracy against gold labels. On a question-answering task (QuALITY) and programming task (APPS), RLHF makes LMs better at convincing our subjects but not at completing the task correctly. RLHF also makes the model harder to evaluate: our subjects' false positive rate increases by 24.1% on QuALITY and 18.3% on APPS. Finally, we show that probing, a state-of-the-art approach for detecting Intended Sophistry (e.g. backdoored LMs), does not generalize to U-SOPHISTRY. Our results highlight an important failure mode of RLHF and call for more research in assisting humans to align them.</p></details> |  |
| **[Provably Mitigating Overoptimization in RLHF: Your SFT Loss is Implicitly an Adversarial Regularizer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16436v3)** | 2024-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aligning generative models with human preference via RLHF typically suffers from overoptimization, where an imperfectly learned reward model can misguide the generative model to output undesired responses. We investigate this problem in a principled manner by identifying the source of the misalignment as a form of distributional shift and uncertainty in learning human preferences. To mitigate overoptimization, we first propose a theoretical algorithm that chooses the best policy for an adversarially chosen reward model; one that simultaneously minimizes the maximum likelihood estimation of the loss and a reward penalty term. Here, the reward penalty term is introduced to prevent the policy from choosing actions with spurious high proxy rewards, resulting in provable sample efficiency of the algorithm under a partial coverage style condition. Moving from theory to practice, the proposed algorithm further enjoys an equivalent but surprisingly easy-to-implement reformulation. Using the equivalence between reward models and the corresponding optimal policy, the algorithm features a simple objective that combines: (i) a preference optimization loss that directly aligns the policy with human preference, and (ii) a supervised learning loss that explicitly imitates the policy with a (suitable) baseline distribution. In the context of aligning large language models (LLM), this objective fuses the direct preference optimization (DPO) loss with the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) loss to help mitigate the overoptimization towards undesired responses, for which we name the algorithm Regularized Preference Optimization (RPO). Experiments of aligning LLMs demonstrate the improved performance of RPO compared with DPO baselines. Our work sheds light on the interplay between preference optimization and SFT in tuning LLMs with both theoretical guarantees and empirical evidence.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by The Thirty-Eighth Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems. 31 pages, 7 figures</p></details> |

However, unlike pretraining or fine-tuning a single model, scaling reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) for training large language models poses coordination challenges across four models. We present OpenRLHF, an open-source framework enabling efficient RLHF scaling. Unlike existing RLHF frameworks that co-locate four models on the same GPUs, OpenRLHF re-designs scheduling for the models beyond 70B parameters using Ray, vLLM, and DeepSpeed, leveraging improved resource utilization and diverse training approaches. Integrating seamlessly with Hugging Face, OpenRLHF provides an out-of-the-box solution with optimized algorithms and launch scripts, which ensures user-friendliness. OpenRLHF implements RLHF, DPO, rejection sampling, and other alignment techniques.

| **[Continual SFT Matches Multimodal RLHF with Negative Supervision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14797v1)** | 2024-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal RLHF usually happens after supervised finetuning (SFT) stage to continually improve vision-language models' (VLMs) comprehension. Conventional wisdom holds its superiority over continual SFT during this preference alignment stage. In this paper, we observe that the inherent value of multimodal RLHF lies in its negative supervision, the logit of the rejected responses. We thus propose a novel negative supervised finetuning (nSFT) approach that fully excavates these information resided. Our nSFT disentangles this negative supervision in RLHF paradigm, and continually aligns VLMs with a simple SFT loss. This is more memory efficient than multimodal RLHF where 2 (e.g., DPO) or 4 (e.g., PPO) large VLMs are strictly required. The effectiveness of nSFT is rigorously proved by comparing it with various multimodal RLHF approaches, across different dataset sources, base VLMs and evaluation metrics. Besides, fruitful of ablations are provided to support our hypothesis. We hope this paper will stimulate further research to properly align large vision language models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Value Imprint: A Technique for Auditing the Human Values Embedded in RLHF Datasets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11937v1)** | 2024-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs are increasingly fine-tuned using RLHF datasets to align them with human preferences and values. However, very limited research has investigated which specific human values are operationalized through these datasets. In this paper, we introduce Value Imprint, a framework for auditing and classifying the human values embedded within RLHF datasets. To investigate the viability of this framework, we conducted three case study experiments by auditing the Anthropic/hh-rlhf, OpenAI WebGPT Comparisons, and Alpaca GPT-4-LLM datasets to examine the human values embedded within them. Our analysis involved a two-phase process. During the first phase, we developed a taxonomy of human values through an integrated review of prior works from philosophy, axiology, and ethics. Then, we applied this taxonomy to annotate 6,501 RLHF preferences. During the second phase, we employed the labels generated from the annotation as ground truth data for training a transformer-based machine learning model to audit and classify the three RLHF datasets. Through this approach, we discovered that information-utility values, including Wisdom/Knowledge and Information Seeking, were the most dominant human values within all three RLHF datasets. In contrast, prosocial and democratic values, including Well-being, Justice, and Human/Animal Rights, were the least represented human values. These findings have significant implications for developing language models that align with societal values and norms. We contribute our datasets to support further research in this area.</p></details> |  |

However, existing open-source RLHF projects are still largely confined to the offline learning setting. In this technical report, we aim to fill in this gap and provide a detailed recipe that is easy to reproduce for online iterative RLHF. In particular, since online human feedback is usually infeasible for open-source communities with limited resources, we start by constructing preference models using a diverse set of open-source datasets and use the constructed proxy preference model to approximate human feedback. Then, we discuss the theoretical insights and algorithmic principles behind online iterative RLHF, followed by a detailed practical implementation. Our trained LLM achieves impressive performance on LLM chatbot benchmarks, including AlpacaEval-2, Arena-Hard, and MT-Bench, as well as other academic benchmarks such as HumanEval and TruthfulQA. We have shown that supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and iterative RLHF can obtain state-of-the-art performance with fully open-source datasets.

The prevalent models of RLHF do not account for neuroscience-backed, partially-observed "internal states" that can affect human feedback, nor do they accommodate intermediate feedback during an interaction. Both of these can be instrumental in speeding up learning and improving alignment. To address these limitations, we model RLHF as reinforcement learning with partially observed reward-states (PORRL). We accommodate two kinds of feedback $-$ cardinal and dueling feedback. We first demonstrate that PORRL subsumes a wide class of RL problems, including traditional RL, RLHF, and reward machines. For cardinal feedback, we present two model-based methods (POR-UCRL, POR-UCBVI). We give both cardinal regret and sample complexity guarantees for the methods, showing that they improve over naive history-summarization. We then discuss the benefits of a model-free method like GOLF with naive history-summarization in settings with recursive internal states and dense intermediate feedback. For this purpose, we define a new history aware version of the Bellman-eluder dimension and give a new guarantee for GOLF in our setting, which can be exponentially sharper in illustrative examples. For dueling feedback, we show that a naive reduction to cardinal feedback fails to achieve sublinear dueling regret. We then present the first explicit reduction that converts guarantees for cardinal regret to dueling regret. In both feedback settings, we show that our models and guarantees generalize and extend existing ones.</p></details> | <details><summary>64 pa...</summary><p>64 pages. 14 pages for main paper, 50 pages for references + appendix</p></details> |

It is common to mitigate this by regularizing the policy with KL divergence from a base model, with the hope that balancing reward with regularization will achieve desirable outcomes despite this reward misspecification. We show that when the reward function has light-tailed error, optimal policies under less restrictive KL penalties achieve arbitrarily high utility. However, if error is heavy-tailed, some policies obtain arbitrarily high reward despite achieving no more utility than the base model--a phenomenon we call catastrophic Goodhart. We adapt a discrete optimization method to measure the tails of reward models, finding that they are consistent with light-tailed error. However, the pervasiveness of heavy-tailed distributions in many real-world applications indicates that future sources of RL reward could have heavy-tailed error, increasing the likelihood of reward hacking even with KL regularization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Mecha...</summary><p>Mechanistic Interpretability workshop at ICML 2024; Main conference poster at NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |
| **[SALSA: Soup-based Alignment Learning for Stronger Adaptation in RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01798v1)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In Large Language Model (LLM) development, Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is crucial for aligning models with human values and preferences. RLHF traditionally relies on the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the current policy and a frozen initial policy as a reference, which is added as a penalty in policy optimization algorithms like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). While this constraint prevents models from deviating too far from the initial checkpoint, it limits exploration of the reward landscape, reducing the model's ability to discover higher-quality solutions. As a result, policy optimization is often trapped in a narrow region of the parameter space, leading to suboptimal alignment and performance. This paper presents SALSA (Soup-based Alignment Learning for Stronger Adaptation), a novel approach designed to overcome these limitations by creating a more flexible and better located reference model through weight-space averaging of two independent supervised fine-tuned (SFT) models. This model soup allows for larger deviation in KL divergence and exploring a promising region of the solution space without sacrificing stability. By leveraging this more robust reference model, SALSA fosters better exploration, achieving higher rewards and improving model robustness, out-of-distribution generalization, and performance. We validate the effectiveness of SALSA through extensive experiments on popular open models (Llama2-7B, Mistral-7B, and Gemma-2B) across various benchmarks (MT-Bench, Arena-Hard, UltraFeedback), where it consistently surpasses PPO by fostering deeper exploration and achieving superior alignment in LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[InfoRM: Mitigating Reward Hacking in RLHF via Information-Theoretic Reward Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09345v5)** | 2024-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the success of reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) in aligning language models with human values, reward hacking, also termed reward overoptimization, remains a critical challenge. This issue primarily arises from reward misgeneralization, where reward models (RMs) compute reward using spurious features that are irrelevant to human preferences. In this work, we tackle this problem from an information-theoretic perspective and propose a framework for reward modeling, namely InfoRM, by introducing a variational information bottleneck objective to filter out irrelevant information. Notably, we further identify a correlation between overoptimization and outliers in the IB latent space of InfoRM, establishing it as a promising tool for detecting reward overoptimization. Inspired by this finding, we propose the Cluster Separation Index (CSI), which quantifies deviations in the IB latent space, as an indicator of reward overoptimization to facilitate the development of online mitigation strategies. Extensive experiments on a wide range of settings and RM scales (70M, 440M, 1.4B, and 7B) demonstrate the effectiveness of InfoRM. Further analyses reveal that InfoRM's overoptimization detection mechanism is not only effective but also robust across a broad range of datasets, signifying a notable advancement in the field of RLHF.

| **[Towards Reliable Alignment: Uncertainty-aware RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23726v1)** | 2024-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in aligning Large Language Models with human preferences have benefited from larger reward models and better preference data. However, most of these methodologies rely on the accuracy of the reward model. The reward models used in Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) are typically learned from small datasets using stochastic optimization algorithms, making them prone to high variability. We illustrate the inconsistencies between reward models empirically on numerous open-source datasets. We theoretically show that the fluctuation of the reward models can be detrimental to the alignment problem because the derived policies are more overfitted to the reward model and, hence, are riskier if the reward model itself is uncertain. We use concentration of measure to motivate an uncertainty-aware, conservative algorithm for policy optimization. We show that such policies are more risk-averse in the sense that they are more cautious of uncertain rewards. We theoretically prove that our proposed methodology has less risk than the vanilla method. We corroborate our theoretical results with experiments based on designing an ensemble of reward models. We use this ensemble of reward models to align a language model using our methodology and observe that our empirical findings match our theoretical predictions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reward Difference Optimization For Sample Reweighting In Offline RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09385v2)** | 2024-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), aligning LLMs with human preferences become increasingly important. Although Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) proves effective, it is complicated and highly resource-intensive. As such, offline RLHF has been introduced as an alternative solution, which directly optimizes LLMs with ranking losses on a fixed preference dataset. Current offline RLHF only captures the "ordinal relationship" between responses, overlooking the crucial aspect of how much one is preferred over the others. To address this issue, we propose a simple yet effective solution called Reward Difference Optimization, shorted as RDO. Specifically, we introduce reward difference coefficients to reweigh sample pairs in offline RLHF. We then develop a difference model which captures rich interactions between a pair of responses for predicting these difference coefficients. Experiments with 7B LLMs on the HH and TL;DR datasets substantiate the effectiveness of our method in both automatic metrics and human evaluation, thereby highlighting its potential for aligning LLMs with human intent and values</p></details> | EMNLP 2024 findings |
| **[Measuring memorization in RLHF for code completion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11715v2)** | 2024-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) has become the dominant method to align large models to user preferences. Unlike fine-tuning, for which there are many studies regarding training data memorization, it is not clear how memorization is affected by or introduced in the RLHF alignment process. Understanding this relationship is important as real user data may be collected and used to align large models; if user data is memorized during RLHF and later regurgitated, this could raise privacy concerns. In addition to RLHF, other methods such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and $\Psi$PO have gained popularity for learning directly from human preferences, removing the need for optimizing intermediary reward models with reinforcement learning. In this work, we analyze how training data memorization can surface and propagate through each phase of RLHF and direct preference learning. We focus our study on code completion models, as code completion is one of the most popular use cases for large language models. We find that RLHF significantly decreases the chance that data used for reward modeling and reinforcement learning is memorized in comparison to directly fine-tuning on this data, but that examples already memorized during the fine-tuning stage of RLHF, will, in the majority of cases, remain memorized after RLHF. In contrast, we find that aligning by learning directly from human preference data via a special case of $\Psi$PO, Identity Preference Optimization (IPO), increases the likelihood that training data is regurgitated compared to RLHF. Our work suggests that RLHF, as opposed to direct preference learning, is a safer way to mitigate the risk of regurgitating sensitive preference data when aligning large language models. We find our conclusions are robust across multiple code completion datasets, tasks, and model scales.</p></details> |  |
| **[Boosting Deductive Reasoning with Step Signals In RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09528v2)** | 2024-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Logical reasoning is a crucial task for Large Language Models (LLMs), enabling them to tackle complex problems. Among reasoning tasks, multi-step reasoning poses a particular challenge. Grounded in the theory of formal logic, we have developed an automated method, Multi-step Deduction (MuseD), for deductive reasoning data. MuseD has allowed us to create training and testing datasets for multi-step reasoning. Our generation method enables control over the complexity of the generated instructions, facilitating training and evaluation of models across different difficulty levels. Through RLHF training, our training data has demonstrated significant improvements in logical capabilities for both in-domain of out-of-domain reasoning tasks. Additionally, we have conducted tests to assess the multi-step reasoning abilities of various models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimal Design for Reward Modeling in RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17055v2)** | 2024-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has become a popular approach to align language models (LMs) with human preferences. This method involves collecting a large dataset of human pairwise preferences across various text generations and using it to infer (implicitly or explicitly) a reward model. Numerous methods have been proposed to learn the reward model and align a LM with it. However, the costly process of collecting human preferences has received little attention and could benefit from theoretical insights. This paper addresses this issue and aims to formalize the reward training model in RLHF. We frame the selection of an effective dataset as a simple regret minimization task, using a linear contextual dueling bandit method. Given the potentially large number of arms, this approach is more coherent than the best-arm identification setting. We then propose an offline framework for solving this problem. Under appropriate assumptions - linearity of the reward model in the embedding space, and boundedness of the reward parameter - we derive bounds on the simple regret. Finally, we provide a lower bound that matches our upper bound up to constant and logarithmic terms. To our knowledge, this is the first theoretical contribution in this area to provide an offline approach as well as worst-case guarantees.</p></details> |  |
| **[How to Evaluate Reward Models for RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14872v2)** | 2024-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a new benchmark for reward models that quantifies their ability to produce strong language models through RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback). The gold-standard approach is to run a full RLHF training pipeline and directly probe downstream LLM performance. However, this process is prohibitively expensive. To address this, we build a predictive model of downstream LLM performance by evaluating the reward model on proxy tasks. These proxy tasks consist of a large-scale human preference and a verifiable correctness preference dataset, in which we measure 12 metrics across 12 domains. To investigate which reward model metrics are most correlated to gold-standard RLHF outcomes, we launch an end-to-end RLHF experiment on a large-scale crowdsourced human preference platform to view real reward model downstream performance as ground truth. Ultimately, we compile our data and findings into Preference Proxy Evaluations (PPE), the first reward model benchmark explicitly linked to post-RLHF real-world human preference performance, which we open-source for public use and further development. Our code and evaluations can be found at https://github.com/lmarena/PPE .</p></details> |  |

| **[On The Global Convergence Of Online RLHF With Neural Parametrization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15610v1)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The importance of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values cannot be overstated. RLHF is a three-stage process that includes supervised fine-tuning (SFT), reward learning, and policy learning. Although there are several offline and online approaches to aligning LLMs, they often suffer from distribution shift issues. These issues arise from the inability to accurately capture the distributional interdependence between the reward learning and policy learning stages. Consequently, this has led to various approximated approaches, but the theoretical insights and motivations remain largely limited to tabular settings, which do not hold in practice. This gap between theoretical insights and practical implementations is critical. It is challenging to address this gap as it requires analyzing the performance of AI alignment algorithms in neural network-parameterized settings. Although bi-level formulations have shown promise in addressing distribution shift issues, they suffer from the hyper-gradient problem, and current approaches lack efficient algorithms to solve this. In this work, we tackle these challenges employing the bi-level formulation laid out in Kwon et al. (2024) along with the assumption \emph{Weak Gradient Domination} to demonstrate convergence in an RLHF setup, obtaining a sample complexity of $\epsilon^{-\frac{7}{2}}$ . Our key contributions are twofold: (i) We propose a bi-level formulation for AI alignment in parameterized settings and introduce a first-order approach to solve this problem. (ii) We analyze the theoretical convergence rates of the proposed algorithm and derive state-of-the-art bounds. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to establish convergence rate bounds and global optimality for the RLHF framework in neural network-parameterized settings.</p></details> |  |

This misalignment often results in noticeable distortions and artifacts that cause speech enhancement to be ineffective. To address these issues, we propose a reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) framework to fine-tune an existing speech enhancement approach by optimizing performance using a mean-opinion score (MOS)-based reward model. Our results show that the RLHF-finetuned model has the best performance across different benchmarks for both objective and MOS-based speech quality assessment metrics on the Voicebank+DEMAND dataset. Through ablation studies, we show that both policy gradient loss and supervised MSE loss are important for balanced optimization across the different metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICASSP 2025</p></details> |
| **[Reward-Robust RLHF in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15360v3)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to progress toward more advanced forms of intelligence, Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is increasingly seen as a key pathway toward achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). However, the reliance on reward-model-based (RM-based) alignment methods introduces significant challenges due to the inherent instability and imperfections of Reward Models (RMs), which can lead to critical issues such as reward hacking and misalignment with human intentions. In this paper, we introduce a reward-robust RLHF framework aimed at addressing these fundamental challenges, paving the way for more reliable and resilient learning in LLMs. Our approach introduces a novel optimization objective that carefully balances performance and robustness by incorporating Bayesian Reward Model Ensembles (BRME) to model the uncertainty set of reward functions. This allows the framework to integrate both nominal performance and minimum reward signals, ensuring more stable learning even with imperfect RMs. Empirical results demonstrate that our framework consistently outperforms baselines across diverse benchmarks, showing improved accuracy and long-term stability. We also provide a theoretical analysis, demonstrating that reward-robust RLHF approaches the stability of constant reward settings, which proves to be acceptable even in a stochastic-case analysis. Together, these contributions highlight the framework potential to enhance both the performance and stability of LLM alignment.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Accuracy Paradox in RLHF: When Better Reward Models Don't Yield Better Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06554v2)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback significantly enhances Natural Language Processing by aligning language models with human expectations. A critical factor in this alignment is the strength of reward models used during training. This study explores whether stronger reward models invariably lead to better language models. In this paper, through experiments on relevance, factuality, and completeness tasks using the QA-FEEDBACK dataset and reward models based on Longformer, we uncover a surprising paradox: language models trained with moderately accurate reward models outperform those guided by highly accurate ones. This challenges the widely held belief that stronger reward models always lead to better language models, and opens up new avenues for future research into the key factors driving model performance and how to choose the most suitable reward models.

| **[An Adaptive Placement and Parallelism Framework for Accelerating RLHF Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11819v3)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, ChatGPT or InstructGPT like large language models (LLM) has made a significant impact in the AI world. Many works have attempted to reproduce the complex InstructGPT's training pipeline, namely Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF). However, the mainstream distributed RLHF training methods typically adopt a fixed model placement strategy, referred to as the Co-located strategy. This strategy treats all four interdependent models involved in RLHF as a single entity, distributing them across all devices and applying parallelism techniques designed for a single model, regardless of the workload heterogeneity inherent to each model. As a result, this strategy exacerbates the generation bottlenecks in the RLHF training and degrades the overall training efficiency. To address these issues, we propose a flexible model placement framework that offers two general and agile model placement strategies. The Interleaving strategy helps reduce memory redundancy and communication costs of RLHF training by placing models without dependencies on exclusive devices with careful orchestration. On the other hand, the Disaggregated strategy improves the throughput of model training by separating the training and inference runtime of the RLHF pipeline with additional shadow models. Furthermore, our framework provides a simple user interface and guidelines to easily and flexibly configure these strategies in various training scenarios. Our experiments have shown that our strategy can achieve notable improvements up to 11x, compared to the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches. The results highlight the effectiveness and adaptability of our methods in accelerating the training of distributed RLHF.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mitigating the Alignment Tax of RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06256v4)** | 2024-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs acquire a wide range of abilities during pre-training, but aligning LLMs under Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) can lead to forgetting pretrained abilities, which is also known as the alignment tax. To investigate alignment tax, we conducted experiments with existing RLHF algorithms using OpenLLaMA-3B, which revealed a pronounced alignment tax in NLP tasks. Whereas, despite various techniques to mitigate forgetting, they are often at odds with the RLHF performance, leading to a trade-off between alignment performance and forgetting mitigation, leading to an alignment-forgetting trade-off. In this paper we show that model averaging, which simply interpolates between pre and post RLHF model weights, surprisingly achieves the most strongest alignment-forgetting Pareto front among a wide range of competing methods. To understand its effectiveness, we offer theoretical insights into model averaging, revealing that it enhances performance Pareto front by increasing feature diversity on the layers where tasks share overlapped feature spaces. Empirical evidence corroborates our analysis by showing the benefits of averaging low-level transformer layers. Building on the analysis and the observation that averaging different layers of the transformer leads to significantly different alignment-forgetting trade-offs, we propose Heterogeneous Model Averaging (HMA) to Heterogeneously find various combination ratios of model layers. HMA seeks to maximize the alignment performance while incurring minimal alignment tax. Moreover, we validate HMA's performance across a range of RLHF algorithms over OpenLLaMA-3B and further extend our findings to Mistral-7B which is evaluated by open-sourced preference model and GPT4.

| **[Regressing the Relative Future: Efficient Policy Optimization for Multi-turn RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04612v1)** | 2024-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success at tasks like summarization that involve a single turn of interaction. However, they can still struggle with multi-turn tasks like dialogue that require long-term planning. Previous works on multi-turn dialogue extend single-turn reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) methods to the multi-turn setting by treating all prior dialogue turns as a long context. Such approaches suffer from covariate shift: the conversations in the training set have previous turns generated by some reference policy, which means that low training error may not necessarily correspond to good performance when the learner is actually in the conversation loop. In response, we introduce REgressing the RELative FUture (REFUEL), an efficient policy optimization approach designed to address multi-turn RLHF in LLMs. REFUEL employs a single model to estimate $Q$-values and trains on self-generated data, addressing the covariate shift issue. REFUEL frames the multi-turn RLHF problem as a sequence of regression tasks on iteratively collected datasets, enabling ease of implementation. Theoretically, we prove that REFUEL can match the performance of any policy covered by the training set. Empirically, we evaluate our algorithm by using Llama-3.1-70B-it to simulate a user in conversation with our model. REFUEL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods such as DPO and REBEL across various settings. Furthermore, despite having only 8 billion parameters, Llama-3-8B-it fine-tuned with REFUEL outperforms Llama-3.1-70B-it on long multi-turn dialogues. Implementation of REFUEL can be found at https://github.com/ZhaolinGao/REFUEL/, and models trained by REFUEL can be found at https://huggingface.co/Cornell-AGI.</p></details> |  |
| **[WPO: Enhancing RLHF with Weighted Preference Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11827v2)** | 2024-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is a promising solution to align large language models (LLMs) more closely with human values. Off-policy preference optimization, where the preference data is obtained from other models, is widely adopted due to its cost efficiency and scalability. However, off-policy preference optimization often suffers from a distributional gap between the policy used for data collection and the target policy, leading to suboptimal optimization. In this paper, we propose a novel strategy to mitigate this problem by simulating on-policy learning with off-policy preference data. Our Weighted Preference Optimization (WPO) method adapts off-policy data to resemble on-policy data more closely by reweighting preference pairs according to their probability under the current policy. This method not only addresses the distributional gap problem but also enhances the optimization process without incurring additional costs. We validate our method on instruction following benchmarks including Alpaca Eval 2 and MT-bench. WPO not only outperforms Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) by up to 5.6% on Alpaca Eval 2 but also establishes a remarkable length-controlled winning rate against GPT-4-turbo of 76.7% based on Gemma-2-9b-it. We release the code and models at https://github.com/wzhouad/WPO.</p></details> | EMNLP 2024 |
| **[HybridFlow: A Flexible and Efficient RLHF Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19256v2)** | 2024-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is widely used in Large Language Model (LLM) alignment. Traditional RL can be modeled as a dataflow, where each node represents computation of a neural network (NN) and each edge denotes data dependencies between the NNs. RLHF complicates the dataflow by expanding each node into a distributed LLM training or generation program, and each edge into a many-to-many multicast. Traditional RL frameworks execute the dataflow using a single controller to instruct both intra-node computation and inter-node communication, which can be inefficient in RLHF due to large control dispatch overhead for distributed intra-node computation. Existing RLHF systems adopt a multi-controller paradigm, which can be inflexible due to nesting distributed computation and data communication. We propose HybridFlow, which combines single-controller and multi-controller paradigms in a hybrid manner to enable flexible representation and efficient execution of the RLHF dataflow. We carefully design a set of hierarchical APIs that decouple and encapsulate computation and data dependencies in the complex RLHF dataflow, allowing efficient operation orchestration to implement RLHF algorithms and flexible mapping of the computation onto various devices. We further design a 3D-HybridEngine for efficient actor model resharding between training and generation phases, with zero memory redundancy and significantly reduced communication overhead. Our experimental results demonstrate 1.53$\times$~20.57$\times$ throughput improvement when running various RLHF algorithms using HybridFlow, as compared with state-of-the-art baselines. HybridFlow source code will be available at https://github.com/volcengine/verl.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Perfect Blend: Redefining RLHF with Mixture of Judges](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20370v1)** | 2024-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has become the leading approach for fine-tuning large language models (LLM). However, RLHF has limitations in multi-task learning (MTL) due to challenges of reward hacking and extreme multi-objective optimization (i.e., trade-off of multiple and/or sometimes conflicting objectives). Applying RLHF for MTL currently requires careful tuning of the weights for reward model and data combinations. This is often done via human intuition and does not generalize. In this work, we introduce a novel post-training paradigm which we called Constrained Generative Policy Optimization (CGPO). The core of CGPO is Mixture of Judges (MoJ) with cost-efficient constrained policy optimization with stratification, which can identify the perfect blend in RLHF in a principled manner. It shows strong empirical results with theoretical guarantees, does not require extensive hyper-parameter tuning, and is plug-and-play in common post-training pipelines. Together, this can detect and mitigate reward hacking behaviors while reaching a pareto-optimal point across an extremely large number of objectives. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that CGPO significantly outperforms standard RLHF algorithms like PPO and DPO across various tasks including general chat, STEM questions, instruction following, and coding. Specifically, CGPO shows improvements of 7.4% in AlpacaEval-2 (general chat), 12.5% in Arena-Hard (STEM & reasoning), and consistent gains in other domains like math and coding. Notably, PPO, while commonly used, is prone to severe reward hacking in popular coding benchmarks, which CGPO successfully addresses. This breakthrough in RLHF not only tackles reward hacking and extreme multi-objective optimization challenges but also advances the state-of-the-art in aligning general-purpose LLMs for diverse applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to conference</p></details> |
| **[RLHFuse: Efficient RLHF Training for Large Language Models with Inter- and Intra-Stage Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13221v2)** | 2024-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) enhances the alignment between LLMs and human preference. The workflow of RLHF typically involves several models and tasks in a series of distinct stages. Existing RLHF training systems view each task as the smallest execution unit thus overlooking the opportunities for subtask-level optimizations. Due to the intrinsic nature of RLHF training, i.e., the data skewness in the generation stage, and the pipeline bubbles in the training stage, existing RLHF systems suffer from low GPU utilization in production deployments. RLHFuse breaks the traditional view of RLHF workflow as a composition of individual tasks, splitting each task into finer-grained subtasks, and performing stage fusion to improve GPU utilization. RLHFuse contains two key ideas. First, for generation and inference tasks, RLHFuse splits them into sample-level subtasks, enabling efficient inter-stage fusion to mitigate the original generation bottleneck dominated by long-tailed samples. Second, for training tasks, RLHFuse breaks them into subtasks of micro-batches. By leveraging the intuition that pipeline execution can be essentially complemented by another pipeline, RLHFuse performs intra-stage fusion to concurrently execute these subtasks in the training stage with a fused pipeline schedule, resulting in fewer pipeline bubbles. In addition, RLHFuse incorporates a series of system optimizations tailored for each stage of RLHF, making it efficient and scalable for our internal product usage. We evaluate RLHFuse on various popular LLMs and the results show that RLHFuse increases the training throughput by up to 3.7x, compared to existing state-of-the-art systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantile Regression for Distributional Reward Models in RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10164v1)** | 2024-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has become a key method for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences through the use of reward models. However, traditional reward models typically generate point estimates, which oversimplify the diversity and complexity of human values and preferences. In this paper, we introduce Quantile Reward Models (QRMs), a novel approach to reward modeling that learns a distribution over rewards instead of a single scalar value. Our method uses quantile regression to estimate a full, potentially multimodal distribution over preferences, providing a more powerful and nuanced representation of preferences. This distributional approach can better capture the diversity of human values, addresses label noise, and accommodates conflicting preferences by modeling them as distinct modes in the distribution. Our experimental results show that QRM outperforms comparable traditional point-estimate models on RewardBench. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the additional information provided by the distributional estimates can be utilized in downstream applications, such as risk-aware reinforcement learning, resulting in LLM policies that generate fewer extremely negative responses. Our code and model are released at https://github.com/Nicolinho/QRM.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Data-Centric RLHF: Simple Metrics for Preference Dataset Comparison](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09603v1)** | 2024-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The goal of aligning language models to human preferences requires data that reveal these preferences. Ideally, time and money can be spent carefully collecting and tailoring bespoke preference data to each downstream application. However, in practice, a select few publicly available preference datasets are often used to train reward models for reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). While new preference datasets are being introduced with increasing frequency, there are currently no existing efforts to measure and compare these datasets. In this paper, we systematically study preference datasets through three perspectives: scale, label noise, and information content. We propose specific metrics for each of these perspectives and uncover different axes of comparison for a better understanding of preference datasets. Our work is a first step towards a data-centric approach to alignment by providing perspectives that aid in training efficiency and iterative data collection for RLHF.</p></details> | Working Paper |
| **[Reward Generalization in RLHF: A Topological Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10184v6)** | 2024-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing alignment methods share a common topology of information flow, where reward information is collected from humans, modeled with preference learning, and used to tune language models. However, this shared topology has not been systematically characterized, nor have its alternatives been thoroughly explored, leaving the problems of low data efficiency and unreliable generalization unaddressed. As a solution, we introduce a theoretical framework for investigating reward generalization in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), focusing on the topology of information flow at both macro and micro levels. At the macro level, we portray the RLHF information flow as an autoencoding process over behavior distributions, formalizing the RLHF objective of distributional consistency between human preference and model behavior. At the micro level, we present induced Bayesian networks as a theory of reward generalization in RLHF, introducing fine-grained dataset topologies into generalization bounds. Combining analysis on both levels, we propose reward modeling from tree-structured preference information. It is shown to reduce reward uncertainty by up to $\Theta(\log n/\log\log n)$ times compared to baselines, where $n$ is the dataset size. Validation on three NLP tasks shows that our tree-based reward model achieves an average win rate of 65% against baseline methods, thus improving reward generalization for free via topology design.</p></details> |  |

RL from AI Feedback (RLAIF), introduced in Bai et al., offers a promising alternative that trains the reward model (RM) on preferences generated by an off-the-shelf LLM. Across the tasks of summarization, helpful dialogue generation, and harmless dialogue generation, we show that RLAIF achieves comparable performance to RLHF. Furthermore, we take a step towards "self-improvement" by demonstrating that RLAIF can outperform a supervised fine-tuned baseline even when the AI labeler is the same size as the policy, or even the exact same checkpoint as the initial policy. Finally, we introduce direct-RLAIF (d-RLAIF) - a technique that circumvents RM training by obtaining rewards directly from an off-the-shelf LLM during RL, which achieves superior performance to canonical RLAIF. Our results suggest that RLAIF can achieve performance on-par with using human feedback, offering a potential solution to the scalability limitations of RLHF.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at ICML 2024</p></details> |
| **[Sequence to Sequence Reward Modeling: Improving RLHF by Language Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00162v1)** | 2024-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aligning the behavior of Large language models (LLMs) with human intentions and values remains a critical challenge. Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) aligns LLMs by training a reward model (RM) on human preferences and fine-tuning the LLMs to maximize RM feedback. Despite its effectiveness and popularity, RLHF is prone to biased local optimization. It means RM fails to provide feedback that accurately aligns with human preference, causing LLMs to explore unexpected generalizations, and failing to achieve alignment objectives. To mitigate this issue, we propose a novel \textit{sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) reward modeling} method. Its key insight is that learning from language feedback rather than scalar feedback improves RLHF without additional annotations. We replaced the reward modeling target from binary maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) with sequence MLE. This method enables richer and fine-grained language feedback without additional annotations, models, or training stages. Our experiments demonstrated its effectiveness, specifically, reducing the refusal-to-response paradigm in single-turn safety dialogues and the long-response bias in text summarization tasks. We provide further analysis that seq2seq RM improves RLHF performance across 2B and 7B LLMs on 3 NLP tasks, achieving an average win rate of 76.9\%. We further show that seq2seq RM can still improve the performance of RLHF under out-of-distribution prompts.</p></details> | 7 pages |

RLHF requires a large number of preference pairs as training data, which are often used in both the Supervised Fine-Tuning and Reward Model training and therefore publicly available datasets are commonly used. In this work, we study to what extent a malicious actor can manipulate the LMs generations by poisoning the preferences, i.e., injecting poisonous preference pairs into these datasets and the RLHF training process. We propose strategies to build poisonous preference pairs and test their performance by poisoning two widely used preference datasets. Our results show that preference poisoning is highly effective: injecting a small amount of poisonous data (1-5\% of the original dataset), we can effectively manipulate the LM to generate a target entity in a target sentiment (positive or negative). The findings from our experiments also shed light on strategies to defend against the preference poisoning attack.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploration-Driven Policy Optimization in RLHF: Theoretical Insights on Efficient Data Utilization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10342v2)** | 2024-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has achieved impressive empirical successes while relying on a small amount of human feedback. However, there is limited theoretical justification for this phenomenon. Additionally, most recent studies focus on value-based algorithms despite the recent empirical successes of policy-based algorithms. In this work, we consider an RLHF algorithm based on policy optimization (PO-RLHF). The algorithm is based on the popular Policy Cover-Policy Gradient (PC-PG) algorithm, which assumes knowledge of the reward function. In PO-RLHF, knowledge of the reward function is not assumed, and the algorithm uses trajectory-based comparison feedback to infer the reward function. We provide performance bounds for PO-RLHF with low query complexity, which provides insight into why a small amount of human feedback may be sufficient to achieve good performance with RLHF. A key novelty is a trajectory-level elliptical potential analysis, which bounds the reward estimation error when comparison feedback (rather than numerical reward observation) is given. We provide and analyze algorithms PG-RLHF and NN-PG-RLHF for two settings: linear and neural function approximation, respectively.</p></details> |  |

Alongside these improvements, however, RLHF also often drives models to produce longer outputs. This paper demonstrates, on three diverse settings, that optimizing for response length is, much more than previously thought, a significant factor behind RLHF. Studying the strategies RL optimization uses to maximize reward, we find improvements in reward to largely be driven by increasing response length, instead of other features. Indeed, we find that even a purely length-based reward reproduces most downstream RLHF improvements over supervised fine-tuned models. Testing a comprehensive set of length-countering interventions, we identify the dominant source of these biases to be reward models, which, by studying training dynamics, we find are non-robust and easily influenced by length biases in preference data.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 13 figures, Accepted to COLM 2024</p></details> |

Notably, collecting human feedback for RLHF can be resource-intensive and lead to scalability issues for LLMs and complex tasks. Our proposed framework Proto-RM leverages prototypical networks to enhance reward models under limited human feedback. By enabling stable and reliable structural learning from fewer samples, Proto-RM significantly enhances LLMs' adaptability and accuracy in interpreting human preferences. Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate that Proto-RM significantly improves the performance of reward models and LLMs in human feedback tasks, achieving comparable and usually better results than traditional methods, while requiring significantly less data. in data-limited scenarios. This research offers a promising direction for enhancing the efficiency of reward models and optimizing the fine-tuning of language models under restricted feedback conditions.</p></details> | Accepted by ACL 2024 |

Since RLHF involves diverse computational workloads and intricate dependencies among multiple LLMs, directly adopting parallelization techniques from supervised training can result in sub-optimal performance. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel approach named parameter ReaLlocation, which dynamically redistributes LLM parameters in the cluster and adapts parallelization strategies during training. Building upon this idea, we introduce ReaLHF, a pioneering system capable of automatically discovering and running efficient execution plans for RLHF training given the desired algorithmic and hardware configurations. ReaLHF formulates the execution plan for RLHF as an augmented dataflow graph. Based on this formulation, ReaLHF employs a tailored search algorithm with a lightweight cost estimator to discover an efficient execution plan. Subsequently, the runtime engine deploys the selected plan by effectively parallelizing computations and redistributing parameters. We evaluate ReaLHF on the LLaMA-2 models with up to $4\times70$ billion parameters and 128 GPUs. The experiment results showcase ReaLHF's substantial speedups of $2.0-10.6\times$ compared to baselines. Furthermore, the execution plans generated by ReaLHF exhibit an average of $26\%$ performance improvement over heuristic approaches based on Megatron-LM. The source code of ReaLHF is publicly available at https://github.com/openpsi-project/ReaLHF .</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages (15 pages with references), 13 figures</p></details> |
| **[It Takes Two: On the Seamlessness between Reward and Policy Model in RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07971v2)** | 2024-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) involves training policy models (PMs) and reward models (RMs) to align language models with human preferences. Instead of focusing solely on PMs and RMs independently, we propose to examine their interactions during fine-tuning, introducing the concept of seamlessness. Our study starts with observing the saturation phenomenon, where continual improvements in RM and PM do not translate into RLHF progress. Our analysis shows that RMs fail to assign proper scores to PM responses, resulting in a 35% mismatch rate with human preferences, highlighting a significant discrepancy between PM and RM. To measure seamlessness between PM and RM without human effort, we propose an automatic metric, SEAM. SEAM quantifies the discrepancies between PM and RM judgments induced by data samples. We validate the effectiveness of SEAM in data selection and model augmentation. Our experiments demonstrate that (1) using SEAM-filtered data for RL training improves RLHF performance by 4.5%, and (2) SEAM-guided model augmentation results in a 4% performance improvement over standard augmentation methods.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents a novel two-step Coarse-to-Fine Actor model to address the inherent limitations in conversational and analytical capabilities of small-sized LLMs. Our approach begins with the Policy-based Coarse Actor, employing a technique we term "Continuous Maximization". The Coarse Actor establishes an enhanced, knowledge-rich pool adept at aligning with human preference styles in analysis and reasoning. Through the RLHF process, it employs Continuous Maximization, a strategy that dynamically and adaptively extends the output length limit, enabling the generation of more detailed and analytical content. Subsequently, the Fine Actor refines this analytical content, addressing the generation of excessively redundant information from the Coarse Actor. We introduce a "Knowledge Residue Merger" approach, refining the content from the Coarse Actor and merging it with an existing Instruction model to improve quality, correctness, and reduce redundancies. We applied our methodology to the popular Mistral model, creating Mistral-C2F, which has demonstrated exceptional performance across 11 general language tasks and the MT-Bench Dialogue task, outperforming similar-scale models and even larger models with 13B and 30B parameters. Our model has significantly improved conversational and analytical reasoning abilities.</p></details> |  |

Current autonomous driving methods typically utilize either human feedback in machine learning, including RL, or LLMs. Most feedback guides the car agent's learning process (e.g., controlling the car). RLHF is usually applied in the fine-tuning step, requiring direct human "preferences," which are not commonly used in optimizing autonomous driving models. In this research, we innovatively combine RLHF and LLMs to enhance autonomous driving safety. Training a model with human guidance from scratch is inefficient. Our framework starts with a pre-trained autonomous car agent model and implements multiple human-controlled agents, such as cars and pedestrians, to simulate real-life road environments. The autonomous car model is not directly controlled by humans. We integrate both physical and physiological feedback to fine-tune the model, optimizing this process using LLMs. This multi-agent interactive environment ensures safe, realistic interactions before real-world application. Finally, we will validate our model using data gathered from real-life testbeds located in New Jersey and New York City.</p></details> |  |
| **[Active Preference Optimization for Sample Efficient RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10500v2)** | 2024-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is pivotal in aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences. Although aligned generative models have shown remarkable abilities in various tasks, their reliance on high-quality human preference data creates a costly bottleneck in the practical application of RLHF. One primary reason is that current methods rely on uniformly picking prompt-generation pairs from a dataset of prompt-generations, to collect human feedback, resulting in sub-optimal alignment under a constrained budget, which highlights the criticality of adaptive strategies in efficient alignment. Recent works [Mehta et al., 2023, Muldrew et al., 2024] have tried to address this problem by designing various heuristics based on generation uncertainty. However, either the assumptions in [Mehta et al., 2023] are restrictive, or [Muldrew et al., 2024] do not provide any rigorous theoretical guarantee. To address these, we reformulate RLHF within contextual preference bandit framework, treating prompts as contexts, and develop an active-learning algorithm, $\textit{Active Preference Optimization}$ ($\texttt{APO}$), which enhances model alignment by querying preference data from the most important samples, achieving superior performance for small sample budget. We analyze the theoretical performance guarantees of $\texttt{APO}$ under the BTL preference model showing that the suboptimality gap of the policy learned via $\texttt{APO}$ scales as $O(1/\sqrt{T})$ for a budget of $T$. We also show that collecting preference data by choosing prompts randomly leads to a policy that suffers a constant sub-optimality. We perform detailed experimental evaluations on practical preference datasets to validate $\texttt{APO}$'s efficacy over the existing methods, establishing it as a sample-efficient and practical solution of alignment in a cost-effective and scalable manner.</p></details> | <details><summary>New e...</summary><p>New experimental results added.

However, their applications have been restricted to the supervised learning setting, where static objective functions with benign structures are considered. But bilevel problems such as incentive design, inverse reinforcement learning (RL), and RL from human feedback (RLHF) are often modeled as dynamic objective functions that go beyond the simple static objective structures, which pose significant challenges of using existing bilevel solutions. To tackle this new class of bilevel problems, we introduce the first principled algorithmic framework for solving bilevel RL problems through the lens of penalty formulation. We provide theoretical studies of the problem landscape and its penalty-based (policy) gradient algorithms. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms via simulations in the Stackelberg Markov game, RL from human feedback and incentive design.</p></details> | <details><summary>Short...</summary><p>Shorter version accepted to ICML 2024</p></details> |

We consider online exploration in RLHF, which exploits interactive access to human or AI feedback by deliberately encouraging the model to produce diverse, maximally informative responses. By allowing RLHF to confidently stray from the pre-trained model, online exploration offers the possibility of novel, potentially super-human capabilities, but its full potential as a paradigm for language model training has yet to be realized, owing to computational and statistical bottlenecks in directly adapting existing reinforcement learning techniques. We propose a new algorithm for online exploration in RLHF, Exploratory Preference Optimization (XPO), which is simple and practical -- a one-line change to (online) Direct Preference Optimization (DPO; Rafailov et al., 2023) -- yet enjoys the strongest known provable guarantees and promising empirical performance. XPO augments the DPO objective with a novel and principled exploration bonus, empowering the algorithm to explore outside the support of the initial model and human feedback data. In theory, we show that XPO is provably sample-efficient and converges to a near-optimal language model policy under natural exploration conditions, irrespective of whether the initial model has good coverage. Our analysis, which builds on the observation that DPO implicitly performs a form of $Q^{\star}$-approximation (or, Bellman error minimization), combines previously disparate techniques from language modeling and theoretical reinforcement learning in a serendipitous fashion through the perspective of KL-regularized Markov decision processes. Empirically, we find that XPO is more sample-efficient than non-exploratory DPO variants in a preliminary evaluation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Group Robust Preference Optimization in Reward-free RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20304v1)** | 2024-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adapting large language models (LLMs) for specific tasks usually involves fine-tuning through reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) on preference data. While these data often come from diverse labelers' groups (e.g., different demographics, ethnicities, company teams, etc.), traditional RLHF approaches adopt a "one-size-fits-all" approach, i.e., they indiscriminately assume and optimize a single preference model, thus not being robust to unique characteristics and needs of the various groups. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Group Robust Preference Optimization (GRPO) method to align LLMs to individual groups' preferences robustly. Our approach builds upon reward-free direct preference optimization methods, but unlike previous approaches, it seeks a robust policy which maximizes the worst-case group performance. To achieve this, GRPO adaptively and sequentially weights the importance of different groups, prioritizing groups with worse cumulative loss. We theoretically study the feasibility of GRPO and analyze its convergence for the log-linear policy class. By fine-tuning LLMs with GRPO using diverse group-based global opinion data, we significantly improved performance for the worst-performing groups, reduced loss imbalances across groups, and improved probability accuracies compared to non-robust baselines.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[RLHF from Heterogeneous Feedback via Personalization and Preference Aggregation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00254v2)** | 2024-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has been an effective technique for aligning AI systems with human values, with remarkable successes in fine-tuning large-language models recently. Most existing RLHF paradigms make the underlying assumption that human preferences are relatively homogeneous, and can be encoded by a single reward model. In this paper, we focus on addressing the issues due to the inherent heterogeneity in human preferences, as well as their potential strategic behavior in providing feedback. Specifically, we propose two frameworks to address heterogeneous human feedback in principled ways: personalization-based one and aggregation-based one. For the former, we propose two approaches based on representation learning and clustering, respectively, for learning multiple reward models that trades off the bias (due to preference heterogeneity) and variance (due to the use of fewer data for learning each model by personalization). We then establish sample complexity guarantees for both approaches. For the latter, we aim to adhere to the single-model framework, as already deployed in the current RLHF paradigm, by carefully aggregating diverse and truthful preferences from humans. We propose two approaches based on reward and preference aggregation, respectively: the former utilizes both utilitarianism and Leximin approaches to aggregate individual reward models, with sample complexity guarantees; the latter directly aggregates the human feedback in the form of probabilistic opinions. Under the probabilistic-opinion-feedback model, we also develop an approach to handle strategic human labelers who may bias and manipulate the aggregated preferences with untruthful feedback. Based on the ideas in mechanism design, our approach ensures truthful preference reporting, with the induced aggregation rule maximizing social welfare functions.</p></details> | Added experiments |
| **[On the Algorithmic Bias of Aligning Large Language Models with RLHF: Preference Collapse and Matching Regularization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16455v1)** | 2024-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences is crucial for informing fair, economically sound, and statistically efficient decision-making processes. However, we argue that reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) -- the predominant approach for aligning LLMs with human preferences through a reward model -- suffers from an inherent algorithmic bias due to its Kullback--Leibler-based regularization in optimization. In extreme cases, this bias could lead to a phenomenon we term preference collapse, where minority preferences are virtually disregarded. To mitigate this algorithmic bias, we introduce preference matching (PM) RLHF, a novel approach that provably aligns LLMs with the preference distribution of the reward model under the Bradley--Terry--Luce/Plackett--Luce model. Central to our approach is a PM regularizer that takes the form of the negative logarithm of the LLM's policy probability distribution over responses, which helps the LLM balance response diversification and reward maximization. Notably, we obtain this regularizer by solving an ordinary differential equation that is necessary for the PM property. For practical implementation, we introduce a conditional variant of PM RLHF that is tailored to natural language generation. Finally, we empirically validate the effectiveness of conditional PM RLHF through experiments on the OPT-1.3B and Llama-2-7B models, demonstrating a 29% to 41% improvement in alignment with human preferences, as measured by a certain metric, compared to standard RLHF.</p></details> |  |

We first identify the primary challenges of existing popular methods like offline PPO and offline DPO as lacking in strategical exploration of the environment. Then, to understand the mathematical principle of RLHF, we consider a standard mathematical formulation, the reverse-KL regularized contextual bandit for RLHF. Despite its widespread practical application, a rigorous theoretical analysis of this formulation remains open. We investigate its behavior in three distinct settings -- offline, online, and hybrid -- and propose efficient algorithms with finite-sample theoretical guarantees. Moving towards practical applications, our framework, with a robust approximation of the information-theoretical policy improvement oracle, naturally gives rise to several novel RLHF algorithms. This includes an iterative version of the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) algorithm for online settings, and a multi-step rejection sampling strategy for offline scenarios. Our empirical evaluations on real-world alignment experiment of large language model demonstrate that these proposed methods significantly surpass existing strong baselines, such as DPO and Rejection Sampling Optimization (RSO), showcasing the connections between solid theoretical foundations and their potent practical implementations.</p></details> | <details><summary>53 pa...</summary><p>53 pages; theoretical study and algorithmic design of iterative RLHF and DPO</p></details> |

The key to the strategy is learning a reward model ($\varphi$), which can reflect the latent reward model of humans. While this strategy has proven effective, the training methodology requires a lot of human preference annotation (usually in the order of tens of thousands) to train $\varphi$. Such a large-scale annotation is justifiable when it's a one-time effort, and the reward model is universally applicable. However, human goals are subjective and depend on the task, requiring task-specific preference annotations, which can be impractical to fulfill. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach to infuse domain knowledge into $\varphi$, which reduces the amount of preference annotation required ($21\times$), omits Alignment Tax, and provides some interpretability. We validate our approach in E-Commerce Opinion Summarization, with a significant reduction in dataset size (to just $940$ samples) while advancing the SOTA ($\sim4$ point ROUGE-L improvement, $68\%$ of times preferred by humans over SOTA). Our contributions include a novel Reward Modeling technique and two new datasets: PromptOpinSumm (supervised data for Opinion Summarization) and OpinPref (a gold-standard human preference dataset). The proposed methodology opens up avenues for efficient RLHF, making it more adaptable to applications with varying human values. We release the artifacts (Code: github.com/efficient-rlhf.

Hidden context refers to data that affects the feedback received, but which is not represented in the data used to train a preference model. This captures common issues of data collection, such as having human annotators with varied preferences, cognitive processes that result in seemingly irrational behavior, and combining data labeled according to different criteria. We prove that standard applications of preference learning, including reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), implicitly aggregate over hidden contexts according to a well-known voting rule called Borda count. We show this can produce counter-intuitive results that are very different from other methods which implicitly aggregate via expected utility. Furthermore, our analysis formalizes the way that preference learning from users with diverse values tacitly implements a social choice function. A key implication of this result is that annotators have an incentive to misreport their preferences in order to influence the learned model, leading to vulnerabilities in the deployment of RLHF. As a step towards mitigating these problems, we introduce a class of methods called distributional preference learning (DPL). DPL methods estimate a distribution of possible score values for each alternative in order to better account for hidden context. Experimental results indicate that applying DPL to RLHF for LLM chatbots identifies hidden context in the data and significantly reduces subsequent jailbreak vulnerability.

This framework often consists of two steps: learning a reward model from an offline preference dataset followed by running online RL to optimize the learned reward model. In this work, leveraging the idea of reset, we propose a new RLHF algorithm with provable guarantees. Motivated by the fact that offline preference dataset provides informative states (i.e., data that is preferred by the labelers), our new algorithm, Dataset Reset Policy Optimization (DR-PO), integrates the existing offline preference dataset into the online policy training procedure via dataset reset: it directly resets the policy optimizer to the states in the offline dataset, instead of always starting from the initial state distribution. In theory, we show that DR-PO learns to perform at least as good as any policy that is covered by the offline dataset under general function approximation with finite sample complexity. In experiments, we demonstrate that on both the TL;DR summarization and the Anthropic Helpful Harmful (HH) dataset, the generation from DR-PO is better than that from Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Direction Preference Optimization (DPO), under the metric of GPT4 win-rate.

However, training LLMs to serve as effective assistants for humans requires careful consideration. A promising approach is reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), which leverages human feedback to update the model in accordance with human preferences and mitigate issues like toxicity and hallucinations. Yet, an understanding of RLHF for LLMs is largely entangled with initial design choices that popularized the method and current research focuses on augmenting those choices rather than fundamentally improving the framework. In this paper, we analyze RLHF through the lens of reinforcement learning principles to develop an understanding of its fundamentals, dedicating substantial focus to the core component of RLHF -- the reward model. Our study investigates modeling choices, caveats of function approximation, and their implications on RLHF training algorithms, highlighting the underlying assumptions made about the expressivity of reward. Our analysis improves the understanding of the role of reward models and methods for their training, concurrently revealing limitations of the current methodology. We characterize these limitations, including incorrect generalization, model misspecification, and the sparsity of feedback, along with their impact on the performance of a language model. The discussion and analysis are substantiated by a categorical review of current literature, serving as a reference for researchers and practitioners to understand the challenges of RLHF and build upon existing efforts.</p></details> |  |

To reduce harmful outputs, produces and vendors of LLMs have used reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF). In tandem, LLM vendors have been increasingly enabling fine-tuning of their most powerful models. However, concurrent work has shown that fine-tuning can remove RLHF protections. We may expect that the most powerful models currently available (GPT-4) are less susceptible to fine-tuning attacks. In this work, we show the contrary: fine-tuning allows attackers to remove RLHF protections with as few as 340 examples and a 95% success rate. These training examples can be automatically generated with weaker models. We further show that removing RLHF protections does not decrease usefulness on non-censored outputs, providing evidence that our fine-tuning strategy does not decrease usefulness despite using weaker models to generate training data. Our results show the need for further research on protections on LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NAACL 2024. (7 pages)</p></details> |

| **[Balancing Enhancement, Harmlessness, and General Capabilities: Enhancing Conversational LLMs with Direct RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02513v1)** | 2024-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent advancements in Conversational Large Language Models (LLMs), a concerning trend has emerged, showing that many new base LLMs experience a knowledge reduction in their foundational capabilities following Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). This process often leads to issues such as forgetting or a decrease in the base model's abilities. Moreover, fine-tuned models struggle to align with user preferences, inadvertently increasing the generation of toxic outputs when specifically prompted. To overcome these challenges, we adopted an innovative approach by completely bypassing SFT and directly implementing Harmless Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). Our method not only preserves the base model's general capabilities but also significantly enhances its conversational abilities, while notably reducing the generation of toxic outputs. Our approach holds significant implications for fields that demand a nuanced understanding and generation of responses, such as customer service. We applied this methodology to Mistral, the most popular base model, thereby creating Mistral-Plus. Our validation across 11 general tasks demonstrates that Mistral-Plus outperforms similarly sized open-source base models and their corresponding instruct versions. Importantly, the conversational abilities of Mistral-Plus were significantly improved, indicating a substantial advancement over traditional SFT models in both safety and user preference alignment.</p></details> |  |

While there has been significant work developing these methods, our understanding of the benefits and downsides of each stage in RLHF is still limited. To fill this gap, we present an extensive analysis of how each stage of the process (i.e. supervised fine-tuning (SFT), reward modelling, and RLHF) affects two key properties: out-of-distribution (OOD) generalisation and output diversity. OOD generalisation is crucial given the wide range of real-world scenarios in which these models are being used, while output diversity refers to the model's ability to generate varied outputs and is important for a variety of use cases. We perform our analysis across two base models on both summarisation and instruction following tasks, the latter being highly relevant for current LLM use cases. We find that RLHF generalises better than SFT to new inputs, particularly as the distribution shift between train and test becomes larger. However, RLHF significantly reduces output diversity compared to SFT across a variety of measures, implying a tradeoff in current LLM fine-tuning methods between generalisation and diversity. Our results provide guidance on which fine-tuning method should be used depending on the application, and show that more research is needed to improve the tradeoff between generalisation and diversity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available here: https://github.com/facebookresearch/rlfh-gen-div</p></details> |

The same issue also holds for some reward models in RL. To address the challenges in both training and evaluation, we establish a more reliable evaluation protocol for comparing different training configurations, which inspects the trade-off between LLM evaluation score and response length obtained by varying training hyperparameters. Based on this evaluation, we conduct large-scale studies, where the results shed insights into the efficacy of hyperparameters and tricks used in RL on mitigating length bias. We further propose to improve the reward model by jointly training two linear heads on shared feature representations to predict the rewards, one trained to correlate with length, and the other trained to decorrelate with length and therefore focus more on the actual content. We then discard the length head in RL to prevent reward hacking on length. Experiments demonstrate that our approach almost eliminates the reward correlation with length, and improves the obtained policy by a significant margin.</p></details> |  |

The initial phase of RLHF involves learning human values using a reward model from ranking data. It is observed that the performance of the reward model degrades after one epoch of training, and optimizing too much against the learned reward model eventually hinders the true objective. This paper delves into these issues, leveraging the theoretical insights to design improved reward learning algorithm termed 'Iterative Data Smoothing' (IDS). The core idea is that during each training epoch, we not only update the model with the data, but also update the date using the model, replacing hard labels with soft labels. Our empirical findings highlight the superior performance of this approach over the traditional methods.</p></details> |  |

Reward models are trained as proxies for human preferences to drive reinforcement learning optimization. While reward models are often considered central to achieving high performance, they face the following challenges in practical applications: (1) Incorrect and ambiguous preference pairs in the dataset may hinder the reward model from accurately capturing human intent. (2) Reward models trained on data from a specific distribution often struggle to generalize to examples outside that distribution and are not suitable for iterative RLHF training. In this report, we attempt to address these two issues. (1) From a data perspective, we propose a method to measure the strength of preferences within the data, based on a voting mechanism of multiple reward models. Experimental results confirm that data with varying preference strengths have different impacts on reward model performance. We introduce a series of novel methods to mitigate the influence of incorrect and ambiguous preferences in the dataset and fully leverage high-quality preference data. (2) From an algorithmic standpoint, we introduce contrastive learning to enhance the ability of reward models to distinguish between chosen and rejected responses, thereby improving model generalization. Furthermore, we employ meta-learning to enable the reward model to maintain the ability to differentiate subtle differences in out-of-distribution samples, and this approach can be utilized for iterative RLHF optimization.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods typically rely on low-rank, parameter-efficient updates that limit the model's expressivity and introduce additional parameters per task, leading to scalability issues. To address these limitations, we propose a novel continual full fine-tuning approach leveraging adaptive singular value decomposition (SVD). Our method dynamically identifies task-specific low-rank parameter subspaces and constrains updates to be orthogonal to critical directions associated with prior tasks, thus effectively minimizing interference without additional parameter overhead or storing previous task gradients. We evaluate our approach extensively on standard continual learning benchmarks using both encoder-decoder (T5-Large) and decoder-only (LLaMA-2 7B) models, spanning diverse tasks including classification, generation, and reasoning. Empirically, our method achieves state-of-the-art results, up to 7% higher average accuracy than recent baselines like O-LoRA, and notably maintains the model's general linguistic capabilities, instruction-following accuracy, and safety throughout the continual learning process by reducing forgetting to near-negligible levels. Our adaptive SVD framework effectively balances model plasticity and knowledge retention, providing a practical, theoretically grounded, and computationally scalable solution for continual learning scenarios in large language models.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 13 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

This is typically achieved by converting the knowledge graph into text that the LLM can process in context. While multiple methods of encoding knowledge graphs have been proposed, the impact of this textualization process on LLM performance remains under-explored. We introduce KG-LLM-Bench, a comprehensive and extensible benchmark spanning five knowledge graph understanding tasks, and evaluate how different encoding strategies affect performance across various base models. Our extensive experiments with seven language models and five textualization strategies provide insights for optimizing LLM performance on KG reasoning tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be presented at NAACL-HLT, KnowledgeNLP Workshop (2025)</p></details> |

Inference: Parallel LLM Generation via Concurrent Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06261v2)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated the ability to tackle increasingly complex tasks through advanced reasoning, long-form content generation, and tool use. Solving these tasks often involves long inference-time computations. In human problem solving, a common strategy to expedite work is collaboration: by dividing the problem into sub-tasks, exploring different strategies concurrently, etc. Recent research has shown that LLMs can also operate in parallel by implementing explicit cooperation frameworks, such as voting mechanisms or the explicit creation of independent sub-tasks that can be executed in parallel. However, each of these frameworks may not be suitable for all types of tasks, which can hinder their applicability. In this work, we propose a different design approach: we run LLM "workers" in parallel , allowing them to synchronize via a concurrently-updated attention cache and prompt these workers to decide how best to collaborate. Our approach allows the instances to come up with their own collaboration strategy for the problem at hand, all the while "seeing" each other's partial progress in the concurrent cache. We implement this approach via Hogwild! Inference: a parallel LLM inference engine where multiple instances of the same LLM run in parallel with the same attention cache, with "instant" access to each other's generated tokens. Hogwild! inference takes advantage of Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) to avoid recomputation while improving parallel hardware utilization. We find that modern reasoning-capable LLMs can perform inference with shared Key-Value cache out of the box, without additional fine-tuning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint, work in progress</p></details> |

Current UQ methods typically rely on querying the model multiple times using non-zero temperature sampling to generate diverse outputs for uncertainty estimation. However, the impact of selecting a given temperature parameter is understudied, and our analysis reveals that temperature plays a fundamental role in the quality of uncertainty estimates. The conventional approach of identifying optimal temperature values requires expensive hyperparameter optimization (HPO) that must be repeated for each new model-dataset combination. We propose Monte Carlo Temperature (MCT), a robust sampling strategy that eliminates the need for temperature calibration. Our analysis reveals that: 1) MCT provides more robust uncertainty estimates across a wide range of temperatures, 2) MCT improves the performance of UQ methods by replacing fixed-temperature strategies that do not rely on HPO, and 3) MCT achieves statistical parity with oracle temperatures, which represent the ideal outcome of a well-tuned but computationally expensive HPO process. These findings demonstrate that effective UQ can be achieved without the computational burden of temperature parameter calibration.</p></details> |  |

Information flow tracking (IFT) is a widely-used approach to tracing data propagation, identifying unauthorized activities that may compromise confidentiality or/and integrity in hardware. However, traditional IFT methods struggle with scalability and adaptability, particularly in high-density and interconnected architectures, leading to tracing bottlenecks that limit applicability in large-scale hardware. To address these limitations and show the potential of transformer-based models in integrated circuit (IC) design, this paper introduces LLM-IFT that integrates large language models (LLM) for the realization of the IFT process in hardware. LLM-IFT exploits LLM-driven structured reasoning to perform hierarchical dependency analysis, systematically breaking down even the most complex designs. Through a multi-step LLM invocation, the framework analyzes both intra-module and inter-module dependencies, enabling comprehensive IFT assessment. By focusing on a set of Trust-Hub vulnerability test cases at both the IP level and the SoC level, our experiments demonstrate a 100\% success rate in accurate IFT analysis for confidentiality and integrity checks in hardware.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is presented at IEEE VLSI Test Symposium (VTS) 2025</p></details> |

Existing backdoor triggers are typically limited to fixed word patterns, making them detectable during data cleaning and easily removable post-poisoning. In this work, we explore the use of prompt-specific paraphrases as backdoor triggers, enhancing their stealth and resistance to removal during LLM alignment. We propose AdvBDGen, an adversarially fortified generative fine-tuning framework that automatically generates prompt-specific backdoors that are effective, stealthy, and transferable across models. AdvBDGen employs a generator-discriminator pair, fortified by an adversary, to ensure the installability and stealthiness of backdoors. It enables the crafting and successful installation of complex triggers using as little as 3% of the fine-tuning data. Once installed, these backdoors can jailbreak LLMs during inference, demonstrate improved stability against perturbations compared to traditional constant triggers, and are more challenging to remove. These findings underscore an urgent need for the research community to develop more robust defenses against adversarial backdoor threats in LLM alignment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at the Neurips Safe Generative AI Workshop 2024</p></details> |
| **[Towards LLMs Robustness to Changes in Prompt Format Styles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06969v1)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have gained popularity in recent years for their utility in various applications. However, they are sensitive to non-semantic changes in prompt formats, where small changes in the prompt format can lead to significant performance fluctuations. In the literature, this problem is commonly referred to as prompt brittleness. Previous research on prompt engineering has focused mainly on developing techniques for identifying the optimal prompt for specific tasks. Some studies have also explored the issue of prompt brittleness and proposed methods to quantify performance variations; however, no simple solution has been found to address this challenge. We propose Mixture of Formats (MOF), a simple and efficient technique for addressing prompt brittleness in LLMs by diversifying the styles used in the prompt few-shot examples. MOF was inspired by computer vision techniques that utilize diverse style datasets to prevent models from associating specific styles with the target variable. Empirical results show that our proposed technique reduces style-induced prompt brittleness in various LLMs while also enhancing overall performance across prompt variations and different datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>NAACL...</summary><p>NAACL Student Research Workshop (SRW) 2025</p></details> |

Jailbreak attacks that exploit the \emph{false negatives} of safeguard methods have emerged as a prominent research focus in the field of LLM security. However, we found that the malicious attackers could also exploit false positives of safeguards, i.e., fooling the safeguard model to block safe content mistakenly, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) affecting LLM users. To bridge the knowledge gap of this overlooked threat, we explore multiple attack methods that include inserting a short adversarial prompt into user prompt templates and corrupting the LLM on the server by poisoned fine-tuning. In both ways, the attack triggers safeguard rejections of user requests from the client. Our evaluation demonstrates the severity of this threat across multiple scenarios. For instance, in the scenario of white-box adversarial prompt injection, the attacker can use our optimization process to automatically generate seemingly safe adversarial prompts, approximately only 30 characters long, that universally block over 97% of user requests on Llama Guard 3. These findings reveal a new dimension in LLM safeguard evaluation -- adversarial robustness to false positives.</p></details> |  |

However, the accuracy of hate speech detection systems heavily relies on human-labeled data, which is inherently susceptible to biases. While previous work has examined the issue, the interplay between the characteristics of the annotator and those of the target of the hate are still unexplored. We fill this gap by leveraging an extensive dataset with rich socio-demographic information of both annotators and targets, uncovering how human biases manifest in relation to the target's attributes. Our analysis surfaces the presence of widespread biases, which we quantitatively describe and characterize based on their intensity and prevalence, revealing marked differences. Furthermore, we compare human biases with those exhibited by persona-based LLMs. Our findings indicate that while persona-based LLMs do exhibit biases, these differ significantly from those of human annotators. Overall, our work offers new and nuanced results on human biases in hate speech annotations, as well as fresh insights into the design of AI-driven hate speech detection systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Review of Case-Based Reasoning for LLM Agents: Theoretical Foundations, Architectural Components, and Cognitive Integration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06943v1)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated impressive capabilities in various tasks. Still, they face limitations in tasks requiring specific, structured knowledge, flexibility, or accountable decision-making. While agents are capable of perceiving their environments, forming inferences, planning, and executing actions towards goals, they often face issues such as hallucinations and lack of contextual memory across interactions. This paper explores how Case-Based Reasoning (CBR), a strategy that solves new problems by referencing past experiences, can be integrated into LLM agent frameworks. This integration allows LLMs to leverage explicit knowledge, enhancing their effectiveness. We systematically review the theoretical foundations of these enhanced agents, identify critical framework components, and formulate a mathematical model for the CBR processes of case retrieval, adaptation, and learning. We also evaluate CBR-enhanced agents against other methods like Chain-of-Thought reasoning and standard Retrieval-Augmented Generation, analyzing their relative strengths. Moreover, we explore how leveraging CBR's cognitive dimensions (including self-reflection, introspection, and curiosity) via goal-driven autonomy mechanisms can further enhance the LLM agent capabilities. Contributing to the ongoing research on neuro-symbolic hybrid systems, this work posits CBR as a viable technique for enhancing the reasoning skills and cognitive aspects of autonomous LLM agents.</p></details> |  |

In recent years, thanks to the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), automated repair has achieved remarkable progress. Advanced APR techniques powered by conversational LLMs, most notably ChatGPT, have exhibited impressive repair abilities and gained increasing popularity due to the capabilities of the underlying LLMs in providing repair feedback and performing iterative patch improvement. Despite the superiority, conversational APR techniques still fail to repair a large number of bugs. For example, a state-of-the-art conversational technique ChatRepair does not correctly repair over half of the single-function bugs in the Defects4J dataset. To understand the effectiveness and failures of conversational LLM-based repair and provide possible directions for improvement, we studied the exemplary ChatRepair with a focus on comparing the effectiveness of its cloze-style and full function repair strategies, assessing its key iterative component for patch improvement, and analyzing the repair failures. Our study has led to a series of findings, which we believe provide key implications for future research.</p></details> |  |

The knowledge paradigm of a model, which dictates how it encodes and utilizes knowledge, significantly affects its performance. Despite the continuous development of LLMs under existing knowledge paradigms, issues within these frameworks continue to constrain model potential. This blog post highlight three critical open problems limiting model capabilities: (1) challenges in knowledge updating for LLMs, (2) the failure of reverse knowledge generalization (the reversal curse), and (3) conflicts in internal knowledge. We review recent progress made in addressing these issues and discuss potential general solutions. Based on observations in these areas, we propose a hypothetical paradigm based on Contextual Knowledge Scaling, and further outline implementation pathways that remain feasible within contemporary techniques. Evidence suggests this approach holds potential to address current shortcomings, serving as our vision for future model paradigms. This blog post aims to provide researchers with a brief overview of progress in LLM knowledge systems, while provide inspiration for the development of next-generation model architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Blog ...</summary><p>Blog post preprint, work in progress</p></details> |

LLMs enable users to perform a wide range of natural language tasks, such as classification, entity extraction, and translation, over large datasets. However, LLM inference is highly costly and slow: for example, an NVIDIA L4 GPU running Llama3-8B can only process 6 KB of text per second, taking about a day to handle 15 GB of data; processing a similar amount of data costs around $10K on OpenAI's GPT-4o. In this paper, we propose novel techniques that can significantly reduce the cost of LLM calls for relational data analytics workloads. Our key contribution is developing efficient algorithms for reordering the rows and the fields within each row of an input table to maximize key-value (KV) cache reuse when performing LLM serving. As such, our approach can be easily applied to existing analytics systems and serving platforms. Our evaluation shows that our solution can yield up to 3.4x improvement in job completion time on a benchmark of diverse LLM-based queries using Llama 3 models. Our solution also achieves a 32% cost savings under OpenAI and Anthropic pricing models.</p></details> |  |

However, the neural representation mechanisms underlying these intrinsic capabilities and approaches for their optimal utilization remain inadequately understood. In this work, we make the key discovery that a simple linear classifier can effectively detect intrinsic reasoning capabilities in LLMs' activation space, particularly within specific representation types and network layers. Based on this finding, we propose a classifier-guided search framework that strategically explore a tree-structured response space. In each node expansion, the classifier serves as a scoring and ranking mechanism that efficiently allocates computational resources by identifying and prioritizing more thoughtful reasoning directions for continuation. After completing the tree expansion, we collect answers from all branches to form a candidate answer pool. We propose a branch-aggregation selection method that marginalizes over all supporting branches by aggregating their thoughtfulness scores, thereby identifying the optimal answer from the pool. Experimental results show that our framework's comprehensive exploration not only covers valid reasoning chains but also effectively identifies them, achieving significant improvements across multiple arithmetic reasoning benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

However, existing approaches often overlook the role distinctions within distributed databases and rely on small-scale models with limited generalization capabilities. In this paper, we conduct a preliminary empirical study to emphasize the unique significance of different roles. Building on this insight, we propose AgentFM, a role-aware failure management framework for distributed databases powered by LLM-driven multi-agents. AgentFM addresses failure management by considering system roles, data roles, and task roles, with a meta-agent orchestrating these components. Preliminary evaluations using Apache IoTDB demonstrate the effectiveness of AgentFM and open new directions for further research.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by FSE-IVR'25</p></details> |

Our paper harnesses Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate value-added analysis, a qualitative process analysis technique that aims to identify steps in the process that do not deliver value. To date, this technique is predominantly manual, time-consuming, and subjective. Our method offers a more principled approach which operates in two phases: first, decomposing high-level activities into detailed steps to enable granular analysis, and second, performing a value-added analysis to classify each step according to Lean principles. This approach enables systematic identification of waste while maintaining the semantic understanding necessary for qualitative analysis. We develop our approach using 50 business process models, for which we collect and publish manual ground-truth labels. Our evaluation, comparing zero-shot baselines with more structured prompts reveals (a) a consistent benefit of structured prompting and (b) promising performance for both tasks. We discuss the potential for LLMs to augment human expertise in qualitative process analysis while reducing the time and subjectivity inherent in manual approaches.</p></details> |  |

The early diagnosis of various diseases continues to be a significant challenge in healthcare, primarily due to the nonspecific nature of early symptoms, the shortage of expert medical practitioners, and the need for prolonged clinical evaluations, all of which can delay treatment and adversely affect patient outcomes. With impressive accuracy in prediction across a range of diseases, LLMs have the potential to revolutionize clinical pre-screening and decision-making for various medical conditions. In this work, we study the diagnostic capability of LLMs for Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) with real world patients data. Patient data was collected alongside diagnoses from medical experts, and the performance of LLMs was evaluated in comparison to expert diagnoses for RA disease prediction. We notice an interesting pattern in disease diagnosis and find an unexpected \textit{misalignment between prediction and explanation}. We conduct a series of multi-round analyses using different LLM agents. The best-performing model accurately predicts rheumatoid arthritis (RA) diseases approximately 95\% of the time. However, when medical experts evaluated the reasoning generated by the model, they found that nearly 68\% of the reasoning was incorrect. This study highlights a clear misalignment between LLMs high prediction accuracy and its flawed reasoning, raising important questions about relying on LLM explanations in clinical settings. \textbf{LLMs provide incorrect reasoning to arrive at the correct answer for RA disease diagnosis.}</p></details> |  |
| **[Bypassing Safety Guardrails in LLMs Using Humor](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06577v1)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we show it is possible to bypass the safety guardrails of large language models (LLMs) through a humorous prompt including the unsafe request. In particular, our method does not edit the unsafe request and follows a fixed template -- it is simple to implement and does not need additional LLMs to craft prompts. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of our method across different LLMs. We also show that both removing and adding more humor to our method can reduce its effectiveness -- excessive humor possibly distracts the LLM from fulfilling its unsafe request. Thus, we argue that LLM jailbreaking occurs when there is a proper balance between focus on the unsafe request and presence of humor.</p></details> |  |

However, the security against spoofing attacks remains relatively understudied. For example, a piggyback attack can maliciously alter the meaning of watermarked text-transforming it into hate speech-while preserving the original watermark, thereby damaging the reputation of the LLM provider. We identify two core challenges that make defending against spoofing difficult: (1) the need for watermarks to be both sensitive to semantic-distorting changes and insensitive to semantic-preserving edits, and (2) the contradiction between the need to detect global semantic shifts and the local, auto-regressive nature of most watermarking schemes. To address these challenges, we propose a semantic-aware watermarking algorithm that post-hoc embeds watermarks into a given target text while preserving its original meaning. Our method introduces a semantic mapping model, which guides the generation of a green-red token list, contrastively trained to be sensitive to semantic-distorting changes and insensitive to semantic-preserving changes. Experiments on two standard benchmarks demonstrate strong robustness against removal attacks and security against spoofing attacks, including sentiment reversal and toxic content insertion, while maintaining high watermark detectability. Our approach offers a significant step toward more secure and semantically aware watermarking for LLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/UCSB-NLP-Chang/contrastive-watermark.</p></details> |  |

However, the study of unprovoked targeted attacks by LLMs towards at-risk populations remains underexplored. Our paper presents three novel contributions: (1) the explicit evaluation of LLM-generated attacks on highly vulnerable mental health groups; (2) a network-based framework to study the propagation of relative biases; and (3) an assessment of the relative degree of stigmatization that emerges from these attacks. Our analysis of a recently released large-scale bias audit dataset reveals that mental health entities occupy central positions within attack narrative networks, as revealed by a significantly higher mean centrality of closeness (p-value = 4.06e-10) and dense clustering (Gini coefficient = 0.7). Drawing from sociological foundations of stigmatization theory, our stigmatization analysis indicates increased labeling components for mental health disorder-related targets relative to initial targets in generation chains. Taken together, these insights shed light on the structural predilections of large language models to heighten harmful discourse and highlight the need for suitable approaches for mitigation.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces GTS-LUM, a novel user behavior model that redefines modeling paradigms in telecommunication settings. GTS-LUM adopts a (multi-modal) encoder-adapter-LLM decoder architecture, enhanced with several telecom-specific innovations. Specifically, the model incorporates an advanced timestamp processing method to handle varying time granularities. It also supports multi-modal data inputs -- including structured tables and behavior co-occurrence graphs -- and aligns these with semantic information extracted by a tokenizer using a Q-former structure. Additionally, GTS-LUM integrates a front-placed target-aware mechanism to highlight historical behaviors most relevant to the target. Extensive experiments on industrial dataset validate the effectiveness of this end-to-end framework and also demonstrate that GTS-LUM outperforms LLM4Rec approaches which are popular in recommendation systems, offering an effective and generalizing solution for user behavior modeling in telecommunications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generative AI Voting: Fair Collective Choice is Resilient to LLM Biases and Inconsistencies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11871v4)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scaling up deliberative and voting participation is a longstanding endeavor -- a cornerstone for direct democracy and legitimate collective choice. Recent breakthroughs in generative artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLMs) unravel new capabilities for AI personal assistants to overcome cognitive bandwidth limitations of humans, providing decision support or even direct representation of human voters at large scale. However, the quality of this representation and what underlying biases manifest when delegating collective decision-making to LLMs is an alarming and timely challenge to tackle. By rigorously emulating with high realism more than >50K LLM voting personas in 306 real-world voting elections, we disentangle the nature of different biases in LLMS (GPT 3, GPT 3.5, and Llama2). Complex preferential ballot formats exhibit significant inconsistencies compared to simpler majoritarian elections that show higher consistency. Strikingly though, by demonstrating for the first time in real-world a proportional representation of voters in direct democracy, we are also able to show that fair ballot aggregation methods, such as equal shares, prove to be a win-win: fairer voting outcomes for humans with fairer AI representation, especially for voters who are likely to abstain. This novel underlying relationship proves paramount for democratic resilience in progressives scenarios with low voters turnout and voter fatigue supported by AI representatives: abstained voters are mitigated by recovering highly representative voting outcomes that are fairer. These interdisciplinary insights provide remarkable foundations for science, policymakers, and citizens to develop safeguards and resilience for AI risks in democratic innovations.</p></details> | 23 pages, 5 figures |

While existing studies primarily focus on question types such as false premises, they often overlook out-of-scope questions, where the provided document is semantically highly similar to the query but does not contain the required answer. In this paper, we propose a guided hallucination-based method to efficiently generate a diverse set of out-of-scope questions from a given document corpus. We then evaluate multiple LLMs based on their effectiveness in confusion detection and appropriate response generation. Furthermore, we introduce an improved method for detecting such out-of-scope questions, enhancing the reliability of LLM-based question-answering systems.</p></details> | Accepted by SIGIR'25 |

A Benchmark for Counterfactual Instruction Following](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06460v1)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are now increasingly widely used to simulate personas in virtual environments, leveraging their instruction-following capability. However, we discovered that even state-of-the-art LLMs cannot simulate personas with reversed performance (e.g., student personas with low proficiency in educational settings), which impairs the simulation diversity and limits the practical applications of the simulated environments. In this work, using mathematical reasoning as a representative scenario, we propose the first benchmark dataset for evaluating LLMs on simulating personas with reversed performance, a capability that we dub "counterfactual instruction following". We evaluate both open-weight and closed-source LLMs on this task and find that LLMs, including the OpenAI o1 reasoning model, all struggle to follow counterfactual instructions for simulating reversedly performing personas. Intersectionally simulating both the performance level and the race population of a persona worsens the effect even further. These results highlight the challenges of counterfactual instruction following and the need for further research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Algorithm Discovery With LLMs: Evolutionary Search Meets Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05108v2)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Discovering efficient algorithms for solving complex problems has been an outstanding challenge in mathematics and computer science, requiring substantial human expertise over the years. Recent advancements in evolutionary search with large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in accelerating the discovery of algorithms across various domains, particularly in mathematics and optimization. However, existing approaches treat the LLM as a static generator, missing the opportunity to update the model with the signal obtained from evolutionary exploration. In this work, we propose to augment LLM-based evolutionary search by continuously refining the search operator - the LLM - through reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning. Our method leverages evolutionary search as an exploration strategy to discover improved algorithms, while RL optimizes the LLM policy based on these discoveries. Our experiments on three combinatorial optimization tasks - bin packing, traveling salesman, and the flatpack problem - show that combining RL and evolutionary search improves discovery efficiency of improved algorithms, showcasing the potential of RL-enhanced evolutionary strategies to assist computer scientists and mathematicians for more efficient algorithm design.</p></details> | 30 pages |
| **[Randomness, Not Representation: The Unreliability of Evaluating Cultural Alignment in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08688v2)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Research on the 'cultural alignment' of Large Language Models (LLMs) has emerged in response to growing interest in understanding representation across diverse stakeholders. Current approaches to evaluating cultural alignment through survey-based assessments that borrow from social science methodologies often overlook systematic robustness checks. Here, we identify and test three assumptions behind current survey-based evaluation methods: (1) Stability: that cultural alignment is a property of LLMs rather than an artifact of evaluation design, (2) Extrapolability: that alignment with one culture on a narrow set of issues predicts alignment with that culture on others, and (3) Steerability: that LLMs can be reliably prompted to represent specific cultural perspectives. Through experiments examining both explicit and implicit preferences of leading LLMs, we find a high level of instability across presentation formats, incoherence between evaluated versus held-out cultural dimensions, and erratic behavior under prompt steering. We show that these inconsistencies can cause the results of an evaluation to be very sensitive to minor variations in methodology. Finally, we demonstrate in a case study on evaluation design that narrow experiments and a selective assessment of evidence can be used to paint an incomplete picture of LLMs' cultural alignment properties. Overall, these results highlight significant limitations of current survey-based approaches to evaluating the cultural alignment of LLMs and highlight a need for systematic robustness checks and red-teaming for evaluation results. Data and code are available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/akhan02/cultural-dimension-cover-letters and https://github.com/ariba-k/llm-cultural-alignment-evaluation, respectively.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods like low-rank adaptations (LoRA) are efficient but lack flexibility, while Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures enhance model capacity at the cost of more & under-utilized parameters. To address these limitations, we propose Structural Mixture of Residual Experts (S'MoRE), a novel framework that seamlessly integrates the efficiency of LoRA with the flexibility of MoE. Specifically, S'MoRE employs hierarchical low-rank decomposition of expert weights, yielding residuals of varying orders interconnected in a multi-layer structure. By routing input tokens through sub-trees of residuals, S'MoRE emulates the capacity of many experts by instantiating and assembling just a few low-rank matrices. We craft the inter-layer propagation of S'MoRE's residuals as a special type of Graph Neural Network (GNN), and prove that under similar parameter budget, S'MoRE improves "structural flexibility" of traditional MoE (or Mixture-of-LoRA) by exponential order. Comprehensive theoretical analysis and empirical results demonstrate that S'MoRE achieves superior fine-tuning performance, offering a transformative approach for efficient LLM adaptation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Federated RLHF with Aggregated Client Preference for LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03038v3)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) fine-tunes a pretrained large language model (LLM) using user preference data, enabling it to generate content aligned with human preferences. However, due to privacy concerns, users may be reluctant to share sensitive preference data. To address this, we propose utilizing Federated Learning (FL) techniques, allowing large-scale preference collection from diverse real-world users without requiring them to transmit data to a central server. Our federated RLHF methods (i.e., FedBis and FedBiscuit) encode each client's preferences into binary selectors and aggregate them to capture common preferences. In particular, FedBiscuit overcomes key challenges, such as preference heterogeneity and reward hacking, through innovative solutions like grouping clients with similar preferences to reduce heterogeneity and using multiple binary selectors to enhance LLM output quality. To evaluate the performance of the proposed methods, we establish the first federated RLHF benchmark with a heterogeneous human preference dataset. Experimental results show that by integrating the LLM with aggregated client preferences, FedBis and FedBiscuit significantly enhance the professionalism and readability of the generated content.</p></details> | ICLR'25 |
| **[Query Understanding in LLM-based Conversational Information Seeking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06356v1)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Query understanding in Conversational Information Seeking (CIS) involves accurately interpreting user intent through context-aware interactions. This includes resolving ambiguities, refining queries, and adapting to evolving information needs. Large Language Models (LLMs) enhance this process by interpreting nuanced language and adapting dynamically, improving the relevance and precision of search results in real-time. In this tutorial, we explore advanced techniques to enhance query understanding in LLM-based CIS systems. We delve into LLM-driven methods for developing robust evaluation metrics to assess query understanding quality in multi-turn interactions, strategies for building more interactive systems, and applications like proactive query management and query reformulation. We also discuss key challenges in integrating LLMs for query understanding in conversational search systems and outline future research directions. Our goal is to deepen the audience's understanding of LLM-based conversational query understanding and inspire discussions to drive ongoing advancements in this field.</p></details> | WWW'25 Tutorial |

We address this gap with a novel architecture that reframes LLM finetuning as Gaussian process (GP) marginal likelihood optimization via deep kernel methods. We introduce LLM-based deep kernels, jointly optimized with GPs to preserve the benefits of both - LLMs to provide a rich and flexible input space for Bayesian optimization and - GPs to model this space with predictive uncertainty for more efficient sampling. Applied to Buchwald-Hartwig reaction optimization, our method nearly doubles the discovery rate of high-performing reactions compared to static LLM embeddings (from 24% to 43% coverage of the top 5% reactions in just 50 optimization iterations). We also observe a 14% improvement over domain-specific representations without requiring specialized features. Extensive empirical evaluation across 19 benchmarks - ranging from general chemistry to reaction and molecular property optimization - demonstrates our method's robustness, generality, and consistent improvements across: (1) tasks, (2) LLM architectures (encoder, decoder, encoder-decoder), (3) pretraining domains (chemistry-related or general-purpose) and (4) hyperparameter settings (tuned once on a single dataset). Finally, we explain these improvements: joint LLM-GP optimization through marginal likelihood implicitly performs contrastive learning, aligning representations to produce (1) better-structured embedding spaces, (2) improved uncertainty calibration, and (3) more efficient sampling - without requiring any external loss. This work provides both practical advances in sample-efficient optimization and insights into what makes effective Bayesian optimization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modeling Challenging Patient Interactions: LLMs for Medical Communication Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22250v2)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective patient communication is pivotal in healthcare, yet traditional medical training often lacks exposure to diverse, challenging interpersonal dynamics. To bridge this gap, this study proposes the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to simulate authentic patient communication styles, specifically the "accuser" and "rationalizer" personas derived from the Satir model, while also ensuring multilingual applicability to accommodate diverse cultural contexts and enhance accessibility for medical professionals. Leveraging advanced prompt engineering, including behavioral prompts, author's notes, and stubbornness mechanisms, we developed virtual patients (VPs) that embody nuanced emotional and conversational traits. Medical professionals evaluated these VPs, rating their authenticity (accuser: $3.8 \pm 1.0$; rationalizer: $3.7 \pm 0.8$ on a 5-point Likert scale (from one to five)) and correctly identifying their styles. Emotion analysis revealed distinct profiles: the accuser exhibited pain, anger, and distress, while the rationalizer displayed contemplation and calmness, aligning with predefined, detailed patient description including medical history. Sentiment scores (on a scale from zero to nine) further validated these differences in the communication styles, with the accuser adopting negative ($3.1 \pm 0.6$) and the rationalizer more neutral ($4.0 \pm 0.4$) tone. These results underscore LLMs' capability to replicate complex communication styles, offering transformative potential for medical education. This approach equips trainees to navigate challenging clinical scenarios by providing realistic, adaptable patient interactions, enhancing empathy and diagnostic acumen. Our findings advocate for AI-driven tools as scalable, cost-effective solutions to cultivate nuanced communication skills, setting a foundation for future innovations in healthcare training.</p></details> |  |

The LLM unlearning research community has increasingly turned toward empirical benchmarks to assess the effectiveness of such methods. In this paper, we find that existing benchmarks provide an overly optimistic and potentially misleading view on the effectiveness of candidate unlearning methods. By introducing simple, benign modifications to a number of popular benchmarks, we expose instances where supposedly unlearned information remains accessible, or where the unlearning process has degraded the model's performance on retained information to a much greater extent than indicated by the original benchmark. We identify that existing benchmarks are particularly vulnerable to modifications that introduce even loose dependencies between the forget and retain information. Further, we show that ambiguity in unlearning targets in existing benchmarks can easily lead to the design of methods that overfit to the given test queries. Based on our findings, we urge the community to be cautious when interpreting benchmark results as reliable measures of progress, and we provide several recommendations to guide future LLM unlearning research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Appea...</summary><p>Appears in IEEE Secure and Trustworthy Machine Learning (SaTML) '25</p></details> |

However, these processes often require extensive expertise and manual effort, limiting their scalability. Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have shown promise in automating these tasks due to their increasing problem-solving abilities. To support the evaluation and development of such methods, we introduce GenoTEX, a benchmark dataset for the automated analysis of gene expression data. GenoTEX provides analysis code and results for solving a wide range of gene-trait association problems, encompassing dataset selection, preprocessing, and statistical analysis, in a pipeline that follows computational genomics standards. The benchmark includes expert-curated annotations from bioinformaticians to ensure accuracy and reliability. To provide baselines for these tasks, we present GenoAgent, a team of LLM-based agents that adopt a multi-step programming workflow with flexible self-correction, to collaboratively analyze gene expression datasets. Our experiments demonstrate the potential of LLM-based methods in analyzing genomic data, while error analysis highlights the challenges and areas for future improvement. We propose GenoTEX as a promising resource for benchmarking and enhancing automated methods for gene expression data analysis.

| **[Can Performant LLMs Be Ethical? Quantifying the Impact of Web Crawling Opt-Outs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06219v1)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing adoption of web crawling opt-outs by copyright holders of online content raises critical questions about the impact of data compliance on large language model (LLM) performance. However, little is known about how these restrictions (and the resultant filtering of pretraining datasets) affect the capabilities of models trained using these corpora. In this work, we conceptualize this effect as the $\textit{data compliance gap}$ (DCG), which quantifies the performance difference between models trained on datasets that comply with web crawling opt-outs, and those that do not. We measure the data compliance gap in two settings: pretraining models from scratch and continual pretraining from existing compliant models (simulating a setting where copyrighted data could be integrated later in pretraining). Our experiments with 1.5B models show that, as of January 2025, compliance with web data opt-outs does not degrade general knowledge acquisition (close to 0\% DCG). However, in specialized domains such as biomedical research, excluding major publishers leads to performance declines. These findings suggest that while general-purpose LLMs can be trained to perform equally well using fully open data, performance in specialized domains may benefit from access to high-quality copyrighted sources later in training. Our study provides empirical insights into the long-debated trade-off between data compliance and downstream model performance, informing future discussions on AI training practices and policy decisions.</p></details> |  |
| **[TxGemma: Efficient and Agentic LLMs for Therapeutics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06196v1)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Therapeutic development is a costly and high-risk endeavor that is often plagued by high failure rates. To address this, we introduce TxGemma, a suite of efficient, generalist large language models (LLMs) capable of therapeutic property prediction as well as interactive reasoning and explainability. Unlike task-specific models, TxGemma synthesizes information from diverse sources, enabling broad application across the therapeutic development pipeline. The suite includes 2B, 9B, and 27B parameter models, fine-tuned from Gemma-2 on a comprehensive dataset of small molecules, proteins, nucleic acids, diseases, and cell lines. Across 66 therapeutic development tasks, TxGemma achieved superior or comparable performance to the state-of-the-art generalist model on 64 (superior on 45), and against state-of-the-art specialist models on 50 (superior on 26). Fine-tuning TxGemma models on therapeutic downstream tasks, such as clinical trial adverse event prediction, requires less training data than fine-tuning base LLMs, making TxGemma suitable for data-limited applications. Beyond these predictive capabilities, TxGemma features conversational models that bridge the gap between general LLMs and specialized property predictors. These allow scientists to interact in natural language, provide mechanistic reasoning for predictions based on molecular structure, and engage in scientific discussions. Building on this, we further introduce Agentic-Tx, a generalist therapeutic agentic system powered by Gemini 2.5 that reasons, acts, manages diverse workflows, and acquires external domain knowledge. Agentic-Tx surpasses prior leading models on the Humanity's Last Exam benchmark (Chemistry & Biology) with 52.3% relative improvement over o3-mini (high) and 26.7% over o3-mini (high) on GPQA (Chemistry) and excels with improvements of 6.3% (ChemBench-Preference) and 2.4% (ChemBench-Mini) over o3-mini (high).</p></details> |  |

This creates a range of challenges, including selecting an appropriate architecture for a system and assessing different architectural alternatives. Relying on human expertise to accomplish the task of mapping NL requirements to architecture is time-consuming and error-prone. This paper proposes ARLO, an approach that automates this task by leveraging (1) a set of NL requirements for a system, (2) an existing standard that specifies architecturally relevant software quality attributes, and (3) a readily available Large Language Model (LLM). Specifically, ARLO determines the subset of NL requirements for a given system that is architecturally relevant and maps that subset to a tailorable matrix of architectural choices. ARLO applies integer linear programming on the architectural-choice matrix to determine the optimal architecture for the current requirements. We demonstrate ARLO's efficacy using a set of real-world examples. We highlight ARLO's ability (1) to trace the selected architectural choices to the requirements and (2) to isolate NL requirements that exert a particular influence on a system's architecture. This allows the identification, comparative assessment, and exploration of alternative architectural choices based on the requirements and constraints expressed therein.</p></details> |  |

Critical to achieving efficiency is tensor-parallel (TP; a form of MP) execution within tightly-coupled subsets of GPUs, referred to as a scale-up domain, and the larger the scale-up domain the better the performance. New datacenter architectures are emerging with more GPUs able to be tightly-coupled in a scale-up domain, such as moving from 8 GPUs to 72 GPUs connected via NVLink. Unfortunately, larger scale-up domains increase the blast-radius of failures, with a failure of single GPU potentially impacting TP execution on the full scale-up domain, which can degrade overall LLM training throughput dramatically. With as few as 0.1% of GPUs being in a failed state, a high TP-degree job can experience nearly 10% reduction in LLM training throughput. We propose nonuniform-tensor-parallelism (NTP) to mitigate this amplified impact of GPU failures. In NTP, a DP replica that experiences GPU failures operates at a reduced TP degree, contributing throughput equal to the percentage of still-functional GPUs. We also propose a rack-design with improved electrical and thermal capabilities in order to sustain power-boosting of scale-up domains that have experienced failures; combined with NTP, this can allow the DP replica with the reduced TP degree (i.e., with failed GPUs) to keep up with the others, thereby achieving near-zero throughput loss for large-scale LLM training.</p></details> |  |

Prompting advanced LLMs with reasoning capabilities to use search engines during inference is often suboptimal, as the LLM might not fully possess the capability on how to interact optimally with the search engine. This paper introduces Search-R1, an extension of reinforcement learning (RL) for reasoning frameworks where the LLM learns to autonomously generate (multiple) search queries during step-by-step reasoning with real-time retrieval. Search-R1 optimizes LLM reasoning trajectories with multi-turn search interactions, leveraging retrieved token masking for stable RL training and a simple outcome-based reward function. Experiments on seven question-answering datasets show that Search-R1 improves performance by 41% (Qwen2.5-7B) and 20% (Qwen2.5-3B) over various RAG baselines under the same setting. This paper further provides empirical insights into RL optimization methods, LLM choices, and response length dynamics in retrieval-augmented reasoning.

This work investigates the viability of using large language models (LLMs) for hyperparameter optimization by employing a fine-tuned version of Code Llama. Through parameter-efficient fine-tuning using LoRA, we adapt the LLM to generate accurate and efficient hyperparameter recommendations tailored to diverse neural network architectures. Unlike traditional methods such as Optuna, which rely on exhaustive trials, the proposed approach achieves competitive or superior results in terms of Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) while significantly reducing computational overhead. Our approach highlights that LLM-based optimization not only matches state-of-the-art methods like Tree-structured Parzen Estimators but also accelerates the tuning process. This positions LLMs as a promising alternative to conventional optimization techniques, particularly for rapid experimentation. Furthermore, the ability to generate hyperparameters in a single inference step makes this method particularly well-suited for resource-constrained environments such as edge devices and mobile applications, where computational efficiency is paramount. The results confirm that LLMs, beyond their efficiency, offer substantial time savings and comparable stability, underscoring their value in advancing machine learning workflows. All generated hyperparameters are included in the LEMUR Neural Network (NN) Dataset, which is publicly available and serves as an open-source benchmark for hyperparameter optimization research.</p></details> |  |

To enhance and benchmark the capabilities of LLMs, there is a need to develop large-scale resources focused on multilingual, local, and cultural contexts. In this study, we propose a framework, NativQA, that can seamlessly construct large-scale, culturally and regionally aligned QA datasets in native languages. The framework utilizes user-defined seed queries and leverages search engines to collect location-specific, everyday information. It has been evaluated across 39 locations in 24 countries and in 7 languages, ranging from extremely low-resource to high-resource languages, which resulted over 300K Question Answer (QA) pairs. The developed resources can be used for LLM benchmarking and further fine-tuning.

However, its effectiveness in real-world settings is challenged by the need to incorporate context-specific predictions and expert instructions, which traditional MPC often neglects. We propose \IMPC, a novel framework that addresses this gap by integrating real-time human instructions through a Large Language Model~(LLM) to produce context-aware predictions for MPC. Our method employs a Language-to-Distribution~(L2D) module to translate contextual information into predictive disturbance trajectories, which are then incorporated into the MPC optimization. Unlike existing context-aware and language-based MPC models, \IMPC enables dynamic human-LLM interaction and fine-tunes the L2D module in a closed loop with theoretical performance guarantees, achieving a regret bound of $O(\sqrt{T\log T})$ for linear dynamics when optimized via advanced fine-tuning methods such as Direct Preference Optimization~(DPO) using a tailored loss function.</p></details> |  |

This study addresses this gap by collecting and mapping the topics practitioners discuss online, offering practical insights into where priorities lie in developing LLM-based applications. Method: We collected 189 videos from 2022 to 2024 from practitioners actively developing such systems and discussing various aspects they encounter during development and deployment of LLMs in production. We analyzed the transcripts using BERTopic, then manually sorted and merged the generated topics into themes, leading to a total of 20 topics in 8 themes. Results: The most prevalent topics fall within the theme Design & Architecture, with a strong focus on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. Other frequently discussed topics include model capabilities and enhancement techniques (e.g., fine-tuning, prompt engineering), infrastructure and tooling, and risks and ethical challenges. Implications: Our results highlight current discussions and challenges in deploying LLMs in production. This way, we provide a systematic overview of key aspects practitioners should be aware of when developing LLM-based applications. We further pale off topics of interest for academics where further research is needed.</p></details> |  |

Compression methods, such as pruning, can reduce model size, which in turn reduces resource requirements. State-of-the-art pruning is based on coarse-grained methods. They are time-consuming and inherently remove critical model parameters, adversely impacting the quality of the pruned model. This paper introduces projection pruning, a novel fine-grained method for pruning LLMs. In addition, LLM projection pruning is enhanced by a new approach we refer to as composite projection pruning - the synergistic combination of unstructured pruning that retains accuracy and structured pruning that reduces model size. We develop Mosaic, a novel system to create and deploy pruned LLMs using composite projection pruning. Mosaic is evaluated using a range of performance and quality metrics on multiple hardware platforms, LLMs, and datasets. Mosaic is 7.19x faster in producing models than existing approaches. Mosaic models achieve up to 84.2% lower perplexity and 31.4% higher accuracy than models obtained from coarse-grained pruning. Up to 67% faster inference and 68% lower GPU memory use is noted for Mosaic models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Augmentation Policy Optimization with LLM Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13453v2)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data augmentation is a critical component of deep learning pipelines, enhancing model generalization by increasing dataset diversity. Traditional augmentation strategies rely on manually designed transformations, stochastic sampling, or automated search-based approaches. Although automated methods improve performance, they often require extensive computational resources and are tailored to specific datasets. In this work, we propose a Large Language Model (LLM)-guided augmentation optimization strategy that refines augmentation policies based on model performance feedback. We introduce two approaches: (1) LLM-Guided Augmentation Policy Optimization, where augmentation policies are selected by an LLM prior to training and iteratively refined across multiple training cycles, and (2) Adaptive LLM-Guided Augmentation Policy Optimization, where policies adapt in real-time based on performance metrics. This in-training approach eliminates the need for full model retraining before receiving LLM feedback, thereby reducing computational costs while improving performance. Our methodology employs an LLM to dynamically select augmentation transformations based on dataset characteristics, model architecture, and prior training outcomes. Unlike traditional search-based methods, our approach leverages the contextual knowledge of LLMs, particularly in specialized domains like medical imaging, to recommend augmentation strategies tailored to domain-specific data. We evaluate our approach on multiple domain-specific image classification datasets where augmentation is key to model robustness. Results show that LLM-guided augmentation optimization outperforms traditional methods, improving model accuracy. These findings highlight the potential of LLMs in automating and adapting deep learning training workflows.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 4 tables, 3 figures submitted for consideration to 2025 Medical Image Understanding and Analysis Conference (MIUA)</p></details> |

Despite these successes, the robustness and consistency of LLMs in underrepresented languages remain largely unexplored, especially concerning local dialects. Existing benchmarks also focus on main dialects, neglecting LLMs' ability on local dialect texts. In this paper, we introduce a Thai local dialect benchmark covering Northern (Lanna), Northeastern (Isan), and Southern (Dambro) Thai, evaluating LLMs on five NLP tasks: summarization, question answering, translation, conversation, and food-related tasks. Furthermore, we propose a human evaluation guideline and metric for Thai local dialects to assess generation fluency and dialect-specific accuracy. Results show that LLM performance declines significantly in local Thai dialects compared to standard Thai, with only proprietary models like GPT-4o and Gemini2 demonstrating some fluency</p></details> | <details><summary>Datas...</summary><p>Datasets and codes are available at https://github.com/mrpeerat/Thai_local_benchmark</p></details> |

Therefore, intention prediction is pivotal in creating a natural interaction with social robots in human-designed environments. In this paper, we examine using Large Language Models (LLMs) to infer human intention in a collaborative object categorization task with a physical robot. We propose a novel multimodal approach that integrates user non-verbal cues, like hand gestures, body poses, and facial expressions, with environment states and user verbal cues to predict user intentions in a hierarchical architecture. Our evaluation of five LLMs shows the potential for reasoning about verbal and non-verbal user cues, leveraging their context-understanding and real-world knowledge to support intention prediction while collaborating on a task with a social robot.

| **[Understanding Layer Significance in LLM Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17875v3)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aligning large language models (LLMs) through supervised fine-tuning is essential for tailoring them to specific applications. Recent studies suggest that alignment primarily adjusts a model's presentation style rather than its foundational knowledge, indicating that only certain components of the model are significantly impacted. To uncover how alignment affects model behavior at a granular level, we propose identifying which layers within LLMs are most critical to the alignment process. Our approach, named ILA, involves learning a binary mask for the parameter changes in each layer during alignment, as an indicator of layer significance. Experimental results reveal that, despite substantial differences in alignment datasets, the important layers of a model identified by ILA exhibit nearly 90\% overlap, highlighting fundamental patterns in LLM alignment. The results also indicate that freezing non-essential layers improves overall model performance, while selectively tuning the most critical layers significantly enhances fine-tuning efficiency with minimal performance loss. Finally, we discuss how these findings extend from LLM alignment to reasoning.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose an L2 Cache-oriented asynchronous KV Cache prefetching method to break through the memory bandwidth bottleneck in LLM inference through computation-load overlap. By strategically scheduling idle memory bandwidth during active computation windows, our method proactively prefetches required KV Cache into GPU L2 cache, enabling high-speed L2 cache hits for subsequent accesses and effectively hiding HBM access latency within computational cycles. Extensive experiments on NVIDIA H20 GPUs demonstrate that the proposed method achieves 2.15x improvement in attention kernel efficiency and up to 1.97x end-to-end throughput enhancement, surpassing state-of-the-art baseline FlashAttention-3. Notably, our solution maintains orthogonality to existing optimization techniques and can be integrated with current inference frameworks, providing a scalable latency-hiding solution for next-generation LLM inference engines.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Leveraging Robust Optimization for LLM Alignment under Distribution Shifts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05831v1)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) increasingly rely on preference alignment methods to steer outputs toward human values, yet these methods are often constrained by the scarcity of high-quality human-annotated data. To tackle this, recent approaches have turned to synthetic data generated by LLMs as a scalable alternative. However, synthetic data can introduce distribution shifts, compromising the nuanced human preferences that are essential for desirable outputs. In this paper, we propose a novel distribution-aware optimization framework that improves preference alignment in the presence of such shifts. Our approach first estimates the likelihood ratios between the target and training distributions leveraging a learned classifier, then it minimizes the worst-case loss over data regions that reflect the target human-preferred distribution. By explicitly prioritizing the target distribution during optimization, our method mitigates the adverse effects of distributional variation and enhances the generation of responses that faithfully reflect human values.</p></details> |  |
| **[Right Question is Already Half the Answer: Fully Unsupervised LLM Reasoning Incentivization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05812v1)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in challenging tasks such as mathematical reasoning, existing methods to enhance reasoning ability predominantly rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) followed by reinforcement learning (RL) on reasoning-specific data after pre-training. However, these approaches critically depend on external supervisions--such as human labelled reasoning traces, verified golden answers, or pre-trained reward models--which limits scalability and practical applicability. In this work, we propose Entropy Minimized Policy Optimization (EMPO), which makes an early attempt at fully unsupervised LLM reasoning incentivization. EMPO does not require any supervised information for incentivizing reasoning capabilities (i.e., neither verifiable reasoning traces, problems with golden answers, nor additional pre-trained reward models). By continuously minimizing the predictive entropy of LLMs on unlabeled user queries in a latent semantic space, EMPO enables purely self-supervised evolution of reasoning capabilities with strong flexibility and practicality. Our experiments demonstrate competitive performance of EMPO on both mathematical reasoning and free-form commonsense reasoning tasks. Specifically, without any supervised signals, EMPO boosts the accuracy of Qwen2.5-Math-7B Base from 30.7\% to 48.1\% on mathematical benchmarks and improves truthfulness accuracy of Qwen2.5-7B Instruct from 87.16\% to 97.25\% on TruthfulQA.</p></details> | Ongoing work |
| **[Recursive Training Loops in LLMs: How training data properties modulate distribution shift in generated data?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03814v2)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly contributing to the creation of content on the Internet. This creates a feedback loop as subsequent generations of models will be trained on this generated, synthetic data. This phenomenon is receiving increasing interest, in particular because previous studies have shown that it may lead to distribution shift - models misrepresent and forget the true underlying distributions of human data they are expected to approximate (e.g. resulting in a drastic loss of quality). In this study, we study the impact of human data properties on distribution shift dynamics in iterated training loops. We first confirm that the distribution shift dynamics greatly vary depending on the human data by comparing four datasets (two based on Twitter and two on Reddit). We then test whether data quality may influence the rate of this shift. We find that it does on the twitter, but not on the Reddit datasets. We then focus on a Reddit dataset and conduct a more exhaustive evaluation of a large set of dataset properties. This experiment associated lexical diversity with larger, and semantic diversity with smaller detrimental shifts, suggesting that incorporating text with high lexical (but limited semantic) diversity could exacerbate the degradation of generated text. We then focus on the evolution of political bias, and find that the type of shift observed (bias reduction, amplification or inversion) depends on the political lean of the human (true) distribution. Overall, our work extends the existing literature on the consequences of recursive fine-tuning by showing that this phenomenon is highly dependent on features of the human data on which training occurs. This suggests that different parts of internet (e.g. GitHub, Reddit) may undergo different types of shift depending on their properties.</p></details> |  |

We present StealthRank, a novel adversarial ranking attack that manipulates LLM-driven product recommendation systems while maintaining textual fluency and stealth. Unlike existing methods that often introduce detectable anomalies, StealthRank employs an energy-based optimization framework combined with Langevin dynamics to generate StealthRank Prompts (SRPs)-adversarial text sequences embedded within product descriptions that subtly yet effectively influence LLM ranking mechanisms. We evaluate StealthRank across multiple LLMs, demonstrating its ability to covertly boost the ranking of target products while avoiding explicit manipulation traces that can be easily detected. Our results show that StealthRank consistently outperforms state-of-the-art adversarial ranking baselines in both effectiveness and stealth, highlighting critical vulnerabilities in LLM-driven recommendation systems.</p></details> |  |

A Survey of Spatial Reasoning in LLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05786v1)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D spatial understanding is essential in real-world applications such as robotics, autonomous vehicles, virtual reality, and medical imaging. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs), having demonstrated remarkable success across various domains, have been leveraged to enhance 3D understanding tasks, showing potential to surpass traditional computer vision methods. In this survey, we present a comprehensive review of methods integrating LLMs with 3D spatial understanding. We propose a taxonomy that categorizes existing methods into three branches: image-based methods deriving 3D understanding from 2D visual data, point cloud-based methods working directly with 3D representations, and hybrid modality-based methods combining multiple data streams. We systematically review representative methods along these categories, covering data representations, architectural modifications, and training strategies that bridge textual and 3D modalities. Finally, we discuss current limitations, including dataset scarcity and computational challenges, while highlighting promising research directions in spatial perception, multi-modal fusion, and real-world applications.</p></details> | 9 pages, 5 figures |

However, systematic guidelines for selecting optimal layers and developing effective fusion strategies for the integration of LLMs remain underexplored. In this study, we propose a layer-aware embedding selection method and investigate how to quantitatively evaluate different layers to identify the most important ones for downstream NLP tasks, showing that the critical layers vary depending on the dataset. We also explore how combining embeddings from multiple LLMs, without requiring model fine-tuning, can improve performance. Experiments on four English text classification datasets (SST-2, MR, R8, and R52) demonstrate that different layers in LLMs exhibit varying degrees of representational strength for classification, and that combining embeddings from different models can enhance performance if the models exhibit complementary characteristics. Additionally, we discuss resources overhead (memory and inference time) to provide a balanced perspective on the real world feasibility of embedding fusion. Future work will explore multilingual and domain specific datasets, as well as techniques for automating layer selection, to improve both performance and scalability.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 3 figures, Preprint</p></details> |
| **[LLM-assisted Mutation for Whitebox API Testing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05738v1)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cloud applications heavily rely on APIs to communicate with each other and exchange data. To ensure the reliability of cloud applications, cloud providers widely adopt API testing techniques. Unfortunately, existing API testing approaches are insufficient to reach strict conditions, a problem known as fitness plateaus, due to the lack of gradient provided by coverage metrics. To address this issue, we propose MioHint, a novel white-box API testing approach that leverages the code comprehension capabilities of Large Language Model (LLM) to boost API testing. The key challenge of LLM-based API testing lies in system-level testing, which emphasizes the dependencies between requests and targets across functions and files, thereby making the entire codebase the object of analysis. However, feeding the entire codebase to an LLM is impractical due to its limited context length and short memory. MioHint addresses this challenge by synergizing static analysis with LLMs. We retrieve relevant code with data-dependency analysis at the statement level, including def-use analysis for variables used in the target and function expansion for subfunctions called by the target. To evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we conducted experiments across 16 real-world REST API services. The findings reveal that MioHint achieves an average increase of 4.95% absolute in line coverage compared to the baseline, EvoMaster, alongside a remarkable factor of 67x improvement in mutation accuracy. Furthermore, our method successfully covers over 57% of hard-to-cover targets while in baseline the coverage is less than 10%.</p></details> |  |

While short-to-long generations have received considerable attention, generating long texts from extremely long resources remains relatively underexplored. The primary challenge in long-to-long generation lies in effectively integrating and analyzing relevant information from extensive inputs, which remains difficult for current large language models (LLMs). In this paper, we propose LLM$\times$MapReduce-V2, a novel test-time scaling strategy designed to enhance the ability of LLMs to process extremely long inputs. Drawing inspiration from convolutional neural networks, which iteratively integrate local features into higher-level global representations, LLM$\times$MapReduce-V2 utilizes stacked convolutional scaling layers to progressively expand the understanding of input materials. Both quantitative and qualitative experimental results demonstrate that our approach substantially enhances the ability of LLMs to process long inputs and generate coherent, informative long-form articles, outperforming several representative baselines.</p></details> |  |

Their performance depends on the underlying base agent. Existing methods, however, struggle with long-context reasoning and goal adherence. We introduce StateAct, a novel and efficient base agent that enhances decision-making through (1) self-prompting, which reinforces task goals at every step, and (2) chain-of-states, an extension of chain-of-thought that tracks state information over time. StateAct outperforms ReAct, the previous best base agent, by over 10% on Alfworld, 30% on Textcraft, and 7% on Webshop across multiple frontier LLMs. We also demonstrate that StateAct can be used as a drop-in replacement for ReAct with advanced LLM agent methods such as test-time scaling, yielding an additional 12% gain on Textcraft. By improving efficiency and long-range reasoning without requiring additional training or retrieval, StateAct provides a scalable foundation for LLM agents.

Traditional methods for evaluating reflections are time-consuming and may not scale effectively in educational settings. In this work, we employ LLMs to transform student reflections into quantitative scores using two assessment strategies (single-agent and multi-agent) and two prompting techniques (zero-shot and few-shot). Our experiments, conducted on a dataset of 5,278 reflections from 377 students over three academic terms, demonstrate that the single-agent with few-shot strategy achieves the highest match rate with human evaluations. Furthermore, models utilizing LLM-assessed reflection scores outperform baselines in both at-risk student identification and grade prediction tasks. These findings suggest that LLMs can effectively automate reflection assessment, reduce educators' workload, and enable timely support for students who may need additional assistance. Our work emphasizes the potential of integrating advanced generative AI technologies into educational practices to enhance student engagement and academic success.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in Proceedings of the 29th Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (PAKDD 2025)</p></details> |
| **[CALF: Aligning LLMs for Time Series Forecasting via Cross-modal Fine-Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07300v3)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning (e.g., Transformer) has been widely and successfully used in multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF). Unlike existing methods that focus on training models from a single modal of time series input, large language models (LLMs) based MTSF methods with cross-modal text and time series input have recently shown great superiority, especially with limited temporal data. However, current LLM-based MTSF methods usually focus on adapting and fine-tuning LLMs, while neglecting the distribution discrepancy between textual and temporal input tokens, thus leading to sub-optimal performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel Cross-Modal LLM Fine-Tuning (CALF) framework for MTSF by reducing the distribution discrepancy between textual and temporal data, which mainly consists of the temporal target branch with temporal input and the textual source branch with aligned textual input. To reduce the distribution discrepancy, we develop the cross-modal match module to first align cross-modal input distributions. Additionally, to minimize the modality distribution gap in both feature and output spaces, feature regularization loss is developed to align the intermediate features between the two branches for better weight updates, while output consistency loss is introduced to allow the output representations of both branches to correspond effectively. Thanks to the modality alignment, CALF establishes state-of-the-art performance for both long-term and short-term forecasting tasks with low computational complexity, and exhibiting favorable few-shot and zero-shot abilities similar to that in LLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/Hank0626/LLaTA.</p></details> |  |

This work aims at exploring the potential of agentic AI and large language models (LLMs) in addressing the challenges of implementing a standardized archival description process. To this end, we introduce an agentic AI-driven system for automated generation of high-quality metadata descriptions of archival materials. We develop a federated optimization approach that unites the intelligence of multiple LLMs to construct optimal archival metadata. We also suggest methods to overcome the challenges associated with using LLMs for consistent metadata generation. To evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of our techniques, we conducted extensive experiments using a real-world dataset of archival materials, which covers a variety of document types and data formats. The evaluation results demonstrate the feasibility of our techniques and highlight the superior performance of the federated optimization approach compared to single-model solutions in metadata quality and reliability.</p></details> | 15 pages |

We introduce a dataset called HURIT (Human Resource Interview Transcripts), which comprises 3,890 HR interview transcripts sourced from real-world HR interview scenarios. Our findings reveal that pre-trained LLMs, particularly GPT-4 Turbo and GPT-3.5 Turbo, exhibit commendable performance and are capable of producing evaluations comparable to those of expert human evaluators. Although these LLMs demonstrate proficiency in providing scores comparable to human experts in terms of human evaluation metrics, they frequently fail to identify errors and offer specific actionable advice for candidate performance improvement in HR interviews. Our research suggests that the current state-of-the-art pre-trained LLMs are not fully conducive for automatic deployment in an HR interview assessment. Instead, our findings advocate for a human-in-the-loop approach, to incorporate manual checks for inconsistencies and provisions for improving feedback quality as a more suitable strategy.</p></details> | 32 pages, 24 figures |

Typically, advertisers record a large amount of raw footage about the product and then create numerous different short-form advertisement videos based on this raw footage. Creating such videos mainly involves editing raw footage and writing advertisement scripts, which requires a certain level of creative ability. It is usually challenging to create many different video contents for the same product, and manual efficiency is often low. In this paper, we present VC-LLM, a framework powered by Large Language Models for the automatic creation of high-quality short-form advertisement videos. Our approach leverages high-resolution spatial input and low-resolution temporal input to represent video clips more effectively, capturing both fine-grained visual details and broader temporal dynamics. In addition, during training, we incorporate supplementary information generated by rewriting the ground truth text, ensuring that all key output information can be directly traced back to the input, thereby reducing model hallucinations. We also designed a benchmark to evaluate the quality of the created videos. Experiments show that VC-LLM based on GPT-4o can produce videos comparable to those created by humans. Furthermore, we collected numerous high-quality short advertisement videos to create a pre-training dataset and manually cleaned a portion of the data to construct a high-quality fine-tuning dataset. Experiments indicate that, on the benchmark, the VC-LLM based on fine-tuned LLM can produce videos with superior narrative logic compared to those created by the VC-LLM based on GPT-4o.</p></details> |  |

This trend, however, presents significant challenges in inference speed and memory management. Quantization emerges as a promising approach to address the widening gap between LLM size and memory capacity. However, traditional quantization schemes often yield suboptimal compression results for KV caches due to two key factors: i) On-the-fly quantization and de-quantization, causing significant performance overhead; ii) Prevalence of outliers in KV values, challenging low-bitwidth uniform quantization. To this end, we propose MILLION, a novel quantization framework achieving low-bitwidth KV cache through product quantization. First, we conduct a thorough analysis of KV cache distribution, revealing the limitations of existing quantization schemes. Second, we introduce a non-uniform quantization algorithm based on product quantization, which efficiently compresses data while preserving accuracy. Third, we develop a high-performance GPU inference framework with efficient attention kernel and pipeline design for MILLION that leverages sparse computation and asynchronous quantization, significantly enhancing inference speed. Comprehensive evaluation results demonstrate that MILLION can achieve 4 bits quantization with trivial perplexity and accuracy loss, and achieve 2.09x end-to-end performance gains at 32K context length.

However, the effectiveness of RL in social reasoning, particularly in Theory of Mind (ToM), the ability to infer others' mental states, remains largely unexplored. In this study, we demonstrate that RL methods effectively unlock ToM reasoning capabilities even in small-scale LLMs (0.5B to 7B parameters). Using a modest dataset comprising 3200 questions across diverse scenarios, our RL-trained 7B model achieves 84.50\% accuracy on the Hi-ToM benchmark, surpassing models like GPT-4o and DeepSeek-v3 despite significantly fewer parameters. While smaller models ($\leq$3B parameters) suffer from reasoning collapse, larger models (7B parameters) maintain stable performance through consistent belief tracking. Additionally, our RL-based models demonstrate robust generalization to higher-order, out-of-distribution ToM problems, novel textual presentations, and previously unseen datasets. These findings highlight RL's potential to enhance social cognitive reasoning, bridging the gap between structured problem-solving and nuanced social inference in LLMs.</p></details> |  |

However, they still remain the threat of jailbreak attacks, where attackers manipulate designed prompts to make the models elicit malicious outputs. Analyzing jailbreak methods can help us delve into the weakness of LLMs and improve it. In this paper, We reveal a vulnerability in large language models (LLMs), which we term Defense Threshold Decay (DTD), by analyzing the attention weights of the model's output on input and subsequent output on prior output: as the model generates substantial benign content, its attention weights shift from the input to prior output, making it more susceptible to jailbreak attacks. To demonstrate the exploitability of DTD, we propose a novel jailbreak attack method, Sugar-Coated Poison (SCP), which induces the model to generate substantial benign content through benign input and adversarial reasoning, subsequently producing malicious content. To mitigate such attacks, we introduce a simple yet effective defense strategy, POSD, which significantly reduces jailbreak success rates while preserving the model's generalization capabilities.</p></details> |  |

However, most LLM-based methods often narrowly focus on SQL generation, neglecting the complexities of real-world conversational queries. This oversight can lead to unreliable responses, particularly for ambiguous questions that cannot be directly addressed with SQL. To bridge this gap, we propose MMSQL, a comprehensive test suite designed to evaluate the question classification and SQL generation capabilities of LLMs by simulating real-world scenarios with diverse question types and multi-turn Q&A interactions. Using MMSQL, we assessed the performance of popular LLMs, including both open-source and closed-source models, and identified key factors impacting their performance in such scenarios. Moreover, we introduce an LLM-based multi-agent framework that employs specialized agents to identify question types and determine appropriate answering strategies. Our experiments demonstrate that this approach significantly enhances the model's ability to navigate the complexities of conversational dynamics, effectively handling the diverse and complex nature of user queries.

To reduce this cost and leverage the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in relevance judgments, we aim to explore whether LLM-generated annotations can effectively replace human annotations in training retrieval models. Retrieval usually emphasizes relevance, which indicates "topic-relatedness" of a document to a query, while in RAG, the value of a document (or utility) depends on how it contributes to answer generation. Recognizing this mismatch, some researchers use LLM performance on downstream tasks with documents as labels, but this approach requires manual answers for specific tasks, leading to high costs and limited generalization. In another line of work, prompting LLMs to select useful documents as RAG references eliminates the need for human annotation and is not task-specific. If we leverage LLMs' utility judgments to annotate retrieval data, we may retain cross-task generalization without human annotation in large-scale corpora. Therefore, we investigate utility-focused annotation via LLMs for large-scale retriever training data across both in-domain and out-of-domain settings on the retrieval and RAG tasks. To reduce the impact of low-quality positives labeled by LLMs, we design a novel loss function, i.e., Disj-InfoNCE. Our experiments reveal that: (1) Retrievers trained on utility-focused annotations significantly outperform those trained on human annotations in the out-of-domain setting on both tasks, demonstrating superior generalization capabilities. (2) LLM annotation does not replace human annotation in the in-domain setting. However, incorporating just 20% human-annotated data enables retrievers trained with utility-focused annotations to match the performance of models trained entirely with human annotations.</p></details> | 12 pages, 4 figures |

In this paper, we build on this idea by extending the refinement from sentence-level to document-level translation, specifically focusing on document-to-document (Doc2Doc) translation refinement. Since sentence-to-sentence (Sent2Sent) and Doc2Doc translation address different aspects of the translation process, we propose fine-tuning LLMs for translation refinement using two intermediate translations, combining the strengths of both Sent2Sent and Doc2Doc. Additionally, recognizing that the quality of intermediate translations varies, we introduce an enhanced fine-tuning method with quality awareness that assigns lower weights to easier translations and higher weights to more difficult ones, enabling the model to focus on challenging translation cases. Experimental results across ten translation tasks with LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct and Mistral-Nemo-Instruct demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> | Under Review |

However, a persistent challenge lies in ensuring these models maintain high accuracy in answering questions while reliably recognizing unanswerable queries. Despite significant advances in large language models (LLMs) for reading comprehension, this issue remains critical, particularly as the length of supported contexts continues to expand. To address this challenge, we propose an innovative data augmentation methodology grounded in a multi-agent collaborative framework. Unlike traditional methods, such as the costly human annotation process required for datasets like SQuAD 2.0, our method autonomously generates evidence-based question-answer pairs and systematically constructs unanswerable questions. Using this methodology, we developed the FactGuard-Bench dataset, which comprises 25,220 examples of both answerable and unanswerable question scenarios, with context lengths ranging from 8K to 128K. Experimental evaluations conducted on seven popular LLMs reveal that even the most advanced models achieve only 61.79% overall accuracy. Furthermore, we emphasize the importance of a model's ability to reason about unanswerable questions to avoid generating plausible but incorrect answers. By implementing efficient data selection and generation within the multi-agent collaborative framework, our method significantly reduces the traditionally high costs associated with manual annotation and provides valuable insights for the training and optimization of LLMs.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we present ShadowCoT, a novel backdoor attack framework that targets the internal reasoning mechanism of LLMs. Unlike prior token-level or prompt-based attacks, ShadowCoT directly manipulates the model's cognitive reasoning path, enabling it to hijack multi-step reasoning chains and produce logically coherent but adversarial outcomes. By conditioning on internal reasoning states, ShadowCoT learns to recognize and selectively disrupt key reasoning steps, effectively mounting a self-reflective cognitive attack within the target model. Our approach introduces a lightweight yet effective multi-stage injection pipeline, which selectively rewires attention pathways and perturbs intermediate representations with minimal parameter overhead (only 0.15% updated). ShadowCoT further leverages reinforcement learning and reasoning chain pollution (RCP) to autonomously synthesize stealthy adversarial CoTs that remain undetectable to advanced defenses. Extensive experiments across diverse reasoning benchmarks and LLMs show that ShadowCoT consistently achieves high Attack Success Rate (94.4%) and Hijacking Success Rate (88.4%) while preserving benign performance. These results reveal an emergent class of cognition-level threats and highlight the urgent need for defenses beyond shallow surface-level consistency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Zhao ...</summary><p>Zhao et al., 16 pages, 2025, uploaded by Hanzhou Wu, Shanghai University</p></details> |
| **[How Well Can Modern LLMs Act as Agent Cores in Radiology Environments?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09529v3)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce RadA-BenchPlat, an evaluation platform that benchmarks the performance of large language models (LLMs) act as agent cores in radiology environments using 2,200 radiologist-verified synthetic patient records covering six anatomical regions, five imaging modalities, and 2,200 disease scenarios, resulting in 24,200 question-answer pairs that simulate diverse clinical situations. The platform also defines ten categories of tools for agent-driven task solving and evaluates seven leading LLMs, revealing that while models like Claude-3.7-Sonnet can achieve a 67.1% task completion rate in routine settings, they still struggle with complex task understanding and tool coordination, limiting their capacity to serve as the central core of automated radiology systems. By incorporating four advanced prompt engineering strategies--where prompt-backpropagation and multi-agent collaboration contributed 16.8% and 30.7% improvements, respectively--the performance for complex tasks was enhanced by 48.2% overall. Furthermore, automated tool building was explored to improve robustness, achieving a 65.4% success rate, thereby offering promising insights for the future integration of fully automated radiology applications into clinical practice.

| **[Scaling Laws for Predicting Downstream Performance in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08527v2)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Precise estimation of downstream performance in large language models (LLMs) prior to training is essential for guiding their development process. Scaling laws analysis utilizes the statistics of a series of significantly smaller sampling language models (LMs) to predict the performance of the target LLM. For downstream performance prediction, the critical challenge lies in the emergent abilities in LLMs that occur beyond task-specific computational thresholds. In this work, we focus on the pre-training loss as a more computation-efficient metric for performance estimation. Our two-stage approach FLP consists of first estimating a function that maps computational resources (e.g., FLOPs) to the pre-training Loss using a series of fully-converged sampling models, followed by mapping the pre-training loss to downstream task Performance using the intermediate models with emerged performance. In our experiments, this FLP solution accurately predicts the performance of LLMs with 7B and 13B parameters using a series of sampling LMs up to 3B, achieving error margins of 5% and 10%, respectively, and significantly outperforming the FLOPs-to-Performance approach. Further, we present FLP-M, a fundamental approach for performance prediction that addresses the practical need to integrate datasets from multiple sources during pre-training. FLP-M extends the power law analytical function to predict domain-specific pre-training loss based on FLOPs across data sources, and employs a two-layer neural network to model the non-linear relationship between multiple domain-specific loss and downstream performance. By utilizing a 3B LLM trained on a specific ratio and a series of smaller sampling LMs, FLP-M can effectively forecast the performance of 3B and 7B LLMs across various data mixtures for most benchmarks within 10% error margins.</p></details> | Accepted to TMLR |
| **[User Feedback Alignment for LLM-powered Exploration in Large-scale Recommendation Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05522v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Exploration, the act of broadening user experiences beyond their established preferences, is challenging in large-scale recommendation systems due to feedback loops and limited signals on user exploration patterns. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer potential by leveraging their world knowledge to recommend novel content outside these loops. A key challenge is aligning LLMs with user preferences while preserving their knowledge and reasoning. While using LLMs to plan for the next novel user interest, this paper introduces a novel approach combining hierarchical planning with LLM inference-time scaling to improve recommendation relevancy without compromising novelty. We decouple novelty and user-alignment, training separate LLMs for each objective. We then scale up the novelty-focused LLM's inference and select the best-of-n predictions using the user-aligned LLM. Live experiments demonstrate efficacy, showing significant gains in both user satisfaction (measured by watch activity and active user counts) and exploration diversity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimized Multi-Token Joint Decoding with Auxiliary Model for LLM Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09722v3)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse tasks, yet their inference processes are hindered by substantial time and energy demands due to single-token generation at each decoding step. While previous methods such as speculative decoding mitigate these inefficiencies by producing multiple tokens per step, each token is still generated by its single-token distribution, thereby enhancing speed without improving effectiveness. In contrast, our work simultaneously enhances inference speed and improves the output effectiveness. We consider multi-token joint decoding (MTJD), which generates multiple tokens from their joint distribution at each iteration, theoretically reducing perplexity and enhancing task performance. However, MTJD suffers from the high cost of sampling from the joint distribution of multiple tokens. Inspired by speculative decoding, we introduce multi-token assisted decoding (MTAD), a novel framework designed to accelerate MTJD. MTAD leverages a smaller auxiliary model to approximate the joint distribution of a larger model, incorporating a verification mechanism that not only ensures the accuracy of this approximation, but also improves the decoding efficiency over conventional speculative decoding. Theoretically, we demonstrate that MTAD closely approximates exact MTJD with bounded error. Empirical evaluations using Llama-2 and OPT models ranging from 13B to 70B parameters across various tasks reveal that MTAD reduces perplexity by 21.2% and improves downstream performance compared to standard single-token sampling. Furthermore, MTAD achieves a 1.42x speed-up and consumes 1.54x less energy than conventional speculative decoding methods. These results highlight MTAD's ability to make multi-token joint decoding both effective and efficient, promoting more sustainable and high-performance deployment of LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diversity Enhances an LLM's Performance in RAG and Long-context Task](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09017v2)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have highlighted the challenge of context window limitations, primarily due to the quadratic time complexity of the self-attention mechanism (\(O(N^2)\), where \(N\) denotes the context window length). This constraint impacts tasks such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) in question answering (Q\&A) and long context summarization. A common approach involves selecting content with the highest similarity to the query; however, this often leads to redundancy and the exclusion of diverse yet relevant information. Building on principles from Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) and Farthest Point Sampling (FPS), we integrate diversity into the content selection process. Our findings reveal that incorporating diversity substantially increases the recall of selecting relevant sentences or chunks before LLM-based Q\&A and summarization. These results highlight the importance of maintaining diversity in future LLM applications to further improve summarization and Q\&A outcomes.</p></details> |  |

Static benchmarks fail to capture the depth and breadth of LLM capabilities and eventually become obsolete, while most dynamic approaches either rely too heavily on LLM-based evaluation or remain constrained by predefined test sets. We introduce Prism, a flexible, dynamic benchmarking framework designed for comprehensive LLM assessment. Prism builds on three key components: (1) a tree-based state representation that models evaluation as a Markov Decision Process, (2) a Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm adapted to uncover challenging evaluation scenarios, and (3) a multi-agent evaluation pipeline that enables simultaneous assessment of diverse capabilities. To ensure robust evaluation, Prism integrates structural measurements of tree exploration patterns with performance metrics across difficulty levels, providing detailed diagnostics of error patterns, test coverage, and solution approaches. Through extensive experiments on five state-of-the-art LLMs, we analyze how model architecture and scale influence code generation performance across varying task difficulties. Our results demonstrate Prism's effectiveness as a dynamic benchmark that evolves with model advancements while offering deeper insights into their limitations.</p></details> |  |

Research studies have demonstrated that LLMs can be leveraged to support robotic operations. However, when facing tasks with complex reasoning, concerns and challenges are raised about the reliability of solutions produced by LLMs. In this paper, we propose a prompt framework with enhanced reasoning to enable reliable LLM-driven control for drones. Our framework consists of novel technical components designed using Guidelines, Skill APIs, Constraints, and Examples, namely GSCE. GSCE is featured by its reliable and constraint-compliant code generation. We performed thorough experiments using GSCE for the control of drones with a wide level of task complexities. Our experiment results demonstrate that GSCE can significantly improve task success rates and completeness compared to baseline approaches, highlighting its potential for reliable LLM-driven autonomous drone systems.</p></details> | 8 pages |

This study introduces a comprehensive evaluation framework with four novel metrics for assessing the effectiveness of five XAI techniques across five LLMs and two downstream tasks. We apply this framework to evaluate several XAI techniques LIME, SHAP, Integrated Gradients, Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP), and Attention Mechanism Visualization (AMV) using the IMDB Movie Reviews and Tweet Sentiment Extraction datasets. The evaluation focuses on four key metrics: Human-reasoning Agreement (HA), Robustness, Consistency, and Contrastivity. Our results show that LIME consistently achieves high scores across multiple LLMs and evaluation metrics, while AMV demonstrates superior Robustness and near-perfect Consistency. LRP excels in Contrastivity, particularly with more complex models. Our findings provide valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of different XAI methods, offering guidance for developing and selecting appropriate XAI techniques for LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2501.15374</p></details> |

Recent methods often utilize memory banks to handle untrimmed videos for video-level understanding. However, they typically compress visual memory using similarity-based greedy approaches, which can overlook the contextual importance of individual tokens. To address this, we introduce an efficient LLM adapter designed for video-level understanding of untrimmed videos that prioritizes the contextual relevance of spatio-temporal tokens. Our framework leverages scorer networks to selectively compress the visual memory bank and filter spatial tokens based on relevance, using a differentiable Top-K operator for end-to-end training. Across three key video-level understanding tasks$\unicode{x2013}$ untrimmed video classification, video question answering, and video captioning$\unicode{x2013}$our method achieves competitive or superior results on four large-scale datasets while reducing computational overhead by up to 34%.

These unique characteristics of LLMs, together with their large model size, make their deployment more challenging. Specifically, (i) deploying LLMs on local devices faces computational, memory, and energy resource issues, while (ii) deploying them in the cloud cannot guarantee real-time service and incurs communication/usage costs. In this paper, we design TMO, a local-cloud LLM inference system with Three-M Offloading: Multi-modal, Multi-task, and Multi-dialogue. TMO incorporates (i) a lightweight local LLM that can process simple tasks at high speed and (ii) a large-scale cloud LLM that can handle multi-modal data sources. We develop a resource-constrained reinforcement learning (RCRL) strategy for TMO that optimizes the inference location (i.e., local vs. cloud) and multi-modal data sources to use for each task/dialogue, aiming to maximize the long-term reward (response quality, latency, and usage cost) while adhering to resource constraints. We also contribute M4A1, a new dataset we curated that contains reward and cost metrics across multiple modality, task, dialogue, and LLM configurations, enabling evaluation of offloading decisions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TMO compared to several exploration-decision and LLM-as-Agent baselines, showing significant improvements in latency, cost, and response quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[EduPlanner: LLM-Based Multi-Agent Systems for Customized and Intelligent Instructional Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05370v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced smart education in the Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) era. A promising application lies in the automatic generalization of instructional design for curriculum and learning activities, focusing on two key aspects: (1) Customized Generation: generating niche-targeted teaching content based on students' varying learning abilities and states, and (2) Intelligent Optimization: iteratively optimizing content based on feedback from learning effectiveness or test scores. Currently, a single large LLM cannot effectively manage the entire process, posing a challenge for designing intelligent teaching plans. To address these issues, we developed EduPlanner, an LLM-based multi-agent system comprising an evaluator agent, an optimizer agent, and a question analyst, working in adversarial collaboration to generate customized and intelligent instructional design for curriculum and learning activities. Taking mathematics lessons as our example, EduPlanner employs a novel Skill-Tree structure to accurately model the background mathematics knowledge of student groups, personalizing instructional design for curriculum and learning activities according to students' knowledge levels and learning abilities. Additionally, we introduce the CIDDP, an LLM-based five-dimensional evaluation module encompassing clarity, Integrity, Depth, Practicality, and Pertinence, to comprehensively assess mathematics lesson plan quality and bootstrap intelligent optimization. Experiments conducted on the GSM8K and Algebra datasets demonstrate that EduPlanner excels in evaluating and optimizing instructional design for curriculum and learning activities. Ablation studies further validate the significance and effectiveness of each component within the framework. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/Zc0812/Edu_Planner</p></details> |  |

Large language models (LLMs) that possess human-like ability in linguistic tasks are increasingly popular in assisting human graders to reduce their workload. However, LLMs' limitations in domain knowledge restrict their understanding in task-specific requirements and hinder their ability to achieve satisfactory performance. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) emerges as a promising solution by enabling LLMs to access relevant domain-specific knowledge during assessment. In this work, we propose an adaptive RAG framework for automated grading that dynamically retrieves and incorporates domain-specific knowledge based on the question and student answer context. Our approach combines semantic search and curated educational sources to retrieve valuable reference materials. Experimental results in a science education dataset demonstrate that our system achieves an improvement in grading accuracy compared to baseline LLM approaches. The findings suggest that RAG-enhanced grading systems can serve as reliable support with efficient performance gains.</p></details> |  |

Probing Rule Learning vs. Memorization in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05262v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite high benchmark scores, Large Language Models (LLMs) often fail simple problem, raising a critical question: Do LLMs learn mathematical principles or merely memorize patterns? Rather than designing increasingly complex benchmarks like recent works, we investigate this using elementary two-integer addition ($0$ to $2^{64}$), probing two core properties: commutativity ($A+B=B+A$) and compositional generalization (via isomorphic symbolic mappings, e.g., $7 \rightarrow y$). While state-of-the-art LLMs achieve 73.8-99.8\% accuracy on numerical addition, performance collapses to $\leq$7.5\% under symbolic mapping, indicating failure to generalize learned rules. Non-monotonic performance scaling with digit count and frequent commutativity violations (over 1,700 cases of $A+B \neq B+A$) further support this. Explicitly providing addition rules degrades performance by 81.2\% on average, while self-explanation maintains baseline accuracy, suggesting LLM arithmetic processing is misaligned with human-defined principles. Our findings indicate current LLMs rely on memory pattern over genuine rule learning, highlighting architectural limitations and the need for new approaches to achieve true mathematical reasoning.</p></details> |  |

A trajectory from today to superintelligence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05259v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As LLM agents grow more capable of causing harm autonomously, AI developers will rely on increasingly sophisticated control measures to prevent possibly misaligned agents from causing harm. AI developers could demonstrate that their control measures are sufficient by running control evaluations: testing exercises in which a red team produces agents that try to subvert control measures. To ensure control evaluations accurately capture misalignment risks, the affordances granted to this red team should be adapted to the capability profiles of the agents to be deployed under control measures. In this paper we propose a systematic framework for adapting affordances of red teams to advancing AI capabilities. Rather than assuming that agents will always execute the best attack strategies known to humans, we demonstrate how knowledge of an agents's actual capability profile can inform proportional control evaluations, resulting in more practical and cost-effective control measures. We illustrate our framework by considering a sequence of five fictional models (M1-M5) with progressively advanced capabilities, defining five distinct AI control levels (ACLs). For each ACL, we provide example rules for control evaluation, control measures, and safety cases that could be appropriate. Finally, we show why constructing a compelling AI control safety case for superintelligent LLM agents will require research breakthroughs, highlighting that we might eventually need alternative approaches to mitigating misalignment risk.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-based Automated Grading with Human-in-the-Loop](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05239v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, particularly large language models (LLMs), has brought significant advancements to the field of education. Among various applications, automatic short answer grading (ASAG), which focuses on evaluating open-ended textual responses, has seen remarkable progress with the introduction of LLMs. These models not only enhance grading performance compared to traditional ASAG approaches but also move beyond simple comparisons with predefined "golden" answers, enabling more sophisticated grading scenarios, such as rubric-based evaluation. However, existing LLM-powered methods still face challenges in achieving human-level grading performance in rubric-based assessments due to their reliance on fully automated approaches. In this work, we explore the potential of LLMs in ASAG tasks by leveraging their interactive capabilities through a human-in-the-loop (HITL) approach. Our proposed framework, GradeHITL, utilizes the generative properties of LLMs to pose questions to human experts, incorporating their insights to refine grading rubrics dynamically. This adaptive process significantly improves grading accuracy, outperforming existing methods and bringing ASAG closer to human-level evaluation.</p></details> |  |

However, Any-to-Any MLLMs are limited to generating pairwise modalities 'Text + X' within a single response, such as Text + {Image or Audio or Video}. To address this limitation, we introduce Spider, a novel efficient Any-to-Many Modalities Generation (AMMG) framework, which can generate an arbitrary combination of modalities 'Text + Xs', such as Text + {Image and Audio and Video}. To achieve efficient AMMG, our Spider integrates three core components: a Base Model for basic X-to-X (i.e., Any-to-Any) modality processing, an Any-to-Many Instruction Template designed for producing Xs signal prompts, and a novel Efficient Decoders-Controller for controlling multimodal Decoders to generate Xs (many-modal) contents. To train Spider, we constructed a novel Text-formatted Many-Modal (TMM) dataset, which facilitates learning the X-to-Xs (i.e., Any-to-Many) capability necessary for AMMG. Ultimately, the well-trained Spider generates a pseudo X-to-Xs dataset, the first-ever X-to-Xs many-modal dataset, enhancing the potential for AMMG tasks in future research. Overall, this work not only pushes the boundary of multimodal interaction but also provides rich data support for advancing the field. Code: https://github.com/Layjins/Spider</p></details> |  |

Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown compelling semantic understanding capabilities and are appealing to researchers studying dense retrieval. LLMs, as decoder-style generative models, are competent at language generation while falling short on modeling global information due to the lack of attention to tokens afterward. Inspired by the classical word-based language modeling approach for IR, i.e., the query likelihood (QL) model, we seek to sufficiently utilize LLMs' generative ability by QL maximization. However, instead of ranking documents with QL estimation, we introduce an auxiliary task of QL maximization to yield a better backbone for contrastively learning a discriminative retriever. We name our model as LLM-QL. To condense global document semantics to a single vector during QL modeling, LLM-QL has two major components, Attention Stop (AS) and Input Corruption (IC). AS stops the attention of predictive tokens to previous tokens until the ending token of the document. IC masks a portion of tokens in the input documents during prediction. Experiments on MSMARCO show that LLM-QL can achieve significantly better performance than other LLM-based retrievers and using QL estimated by LLM-QL for ranking outperforms word-based QL by a large margin.</p></details> | 12 pages, 3 figures |

This is due to the internal access insiders have to systems, information, and infrastructure. %One example of this influence is where anonymous respondents submit web-based job search site reviews, an insider threat risk to organizations. Signals for such risks may be found in anonymous submissions to public web-based job search site reviews. This research studies the potential for large language models (LLMs) to analyze and detect insider threat sentiment within job site reviews. Addressing ethical data collection concerns, this research utilizes synthetic data generation using LLMs alongside existing job review datasets. A comparative analysis of sentiment scores generated by LLMs is benchmarked against expert human scoring. Findings reveal that LLMs demonstrate alignment with human evaluations in most cases, thus effectively identifying nuanced indicators of threat sentiment. The performance is lower on human-generated data than synthetic data, suggesting areas for improvement in evaluating real-world data. Text diversity analysis found differences between human-generated and LLM-generated datasets, with synthetic data exhibiting somewhat lower diversity. Overall, the results demonstrate the applicability of LLMs to insider threat detection, and a scalable solution for insider sentiment testing by overcoming ethical and logistical barriers tied to data acquisition.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 0 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

Quantum-specific linting tools, such as LintQ, have been developed to detect quantum-specific programming problems; however, they typically rely on manually crafted analysis queries. The manual effort required to update these tools limits their adaptability to evolving quantum programming practices. To address this challenge, this study investigates the feasibility of employing Large Language Models (LLMs) to develop a novel linting technique for quantum software development and explores potential avenues to advance linting approaches. We introduce LintQ-LLM, an LLM-based linting tool designed to detect quantum-specific problems comparable to those identified by LintQ. Through an empirical comparative study using real-world Qiskit programs, our results show that LintQ-LLM is a viable solution that complements LintQ, with particular strengths in problem localization, explanation clarity, and adaptability potential for emerging quantum programming frameworks, thus providing a basis for further research. Furthermore, this study discusses several research opportunities for developing more advanced, adaptable, and feedback-aware quantum software quality assurance methods by leveraging LLMs.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we address the problem of formally protecting the sensitive information contained in a prompt while maintaining response quality. To this end, first, we introduce a cryptographically inspired notion of a prompt sanitizer which transforms an input prompt to protect its sensitive tokens. Second, we propose Pr$\epsilon\epsilon$mpt, a novel system that implements a prompt sanitizer. Pr$\epsilon\epsilon$mpt categorizes sensitive tokens into two types: (1) those where the LLM's response depends solely on the format (such as SSNs, credit card numbers), for which we use format-preserving encryption (FPE); and (2) those where the response depends on specific values, (such as age, salary) for which we apply metric differential privacy (mDP). Our evaluation demonstrates that Pr$\epsilon\epsilon$mpt is a practical method to achieve meaningful privacy guarantees, while maintaining high utility compared to unsanitized prompts, and outperforming prior methods</p></details> |  |
| **[RevisEval: Improving LLM-as-a-Judge via Response-Adapted References](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05193v3)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With significant efforts in recent studies, LLM-as-a-Judge has become a cost-effective alternative to human evaluation for assessing text generation quality in a wide range of tasks. However, there still remains a reliability gap between LLM-as-a-Judge and human evaluation. One important reason is the lack of guided oracles in the evaluation process. Motivated by the role of reference pervasively used in classic text evaluation, we introduce RevisEval, a novel text generation evaluation paradigm via the response-adapted references. RevisEval is driven by the key observation that an ideal reference should maintain the necessary relevance to the response to be evaluated. Specifically, RevisEval leverages the text revision capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to adaptively revise the response, then treat the revised text as the reference (response-adapted reference) for the subsequent evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RevisEval outperforms traditional reference-free and reference-based evaluation paradigms that use LLM-as-a-Judge across NLG tasks and open-ended instruction-following tasks. More importantly, our response-adapted references can further boost the classical text metrics, e.g., BLEU and BERTScore, compared to traditional references and even rival the LLM-as-a-Judge. A detailed analysis is also conducted to confirm RevisEval's effectiveness in bias reduction, the impact of inference cost, and reference relevance.</p></details> |  |

While this approach improves reasoning capability, it incurs substantial computational overhead due to iterative agent interactions. Furthermore, engaging in debates for queries that do not necessitate collaboration amplifies the risk of error generation. To address these challenges, we propose Debate Only When Necessary (DOWN), an adaptive multiagent debate framework that selectively activates the debate process based on the confidence score of the agent's initial response. For queries where debate is triggered, agents refine their outputs using responses from participating agents and their confidence scores. Experimental results demonstrate that this mechanism significantly improves efficiency while maintaining or even surpassing the performance of existing multiagent debate systems. We also find that confidence-guided debate mitigates error propagation and enhances the selective incorporation of reliable responses. These results establish DOWN as an optimization strategy for efficient and effective multiagent reasoning, facilitating the practical deployment of LLM-based collaboration.</p></details> |  |

This paper proposes a novel approach leveraging fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance smart contract vulnerability detection. We introduce a comprehensive dataset of 215 real-world DApp projects (4,998 contracts), including hard-to-detect logical errors like token price manipulation, addressing the limitations of existing simplified benchmarks. By fine-tuning LLMs (Llama3-8B and Qwen2-7B) with Full-Parameter Fine-Tuning (FFT) and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), our method achieves superior performance, attaining an F1-score of 0.83 with FFT and data augmentation via Random Over Sampling (ROS). Comparative experiments demonstrate significant improvements over prompt-based LLMs and state-of-the-art tools. Notably, the approach excels in detecting non-machine-auditable vulnerabilities, achieving 0.97 precision and 0.68 recall for price manipulation flaws. The results underscore the effectiveness of domain-specific LLM fine-tuning and data augmentation in addressing real-world DApp security challenges, offering a robust solution for blockchain ecosystem protection.</p></details> |  |
| **[Following the Whispers of Values: Unraveling Neural Mechanisms Behind Value-Oriented Behaviors in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04994v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the impressive performance of large language models (LLMs), they can present unintended biases and harmful behaviors driven by encoded values, emphasizing the urgent need to understand the value mechanisms behind them. However, current research primarily evaluates these values through external responses with a focus on AI safety, lacking interpretability and failing to assess social values in real-world contexts. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called ValueExploration, which aims to explore the behavior-driven mechanisms of National Social Values within LLMs at the neuron level. As a case study, we focus on Chinese Social Values and first construct C-voice, a large-scale bilingual benchmark for identifying and evaluating Chinese Social Values in LLMs. By leveraging C-voice, we then identify and locate the neurons responsible for encoding these values according to activation difference. Finally, by deactivating these neurons, we analyze shifts in model behavior, uncovering the internal mechanism by which values influence LLM decision-making. Extensive experiments on four representative LLMs validate the efficacy of our framework. The benchmark and code will be available.</p></details> |  |

Recently, large language model (LLM)-based agents have streamlined the BI workflow by automatically performing task planning, reasoning, and actions in executable environments based on natural language (NL) queries. However, existing approaches primarily focus on individual BI tasks such as NL2SQL and NL2VIS. The fragmentation of tasks across different data roles and tools lead to inefficiencies and potential errors due to the iterative and collaborative nature of BI. In this paper, we introduce DataLab, a unified BI platform that integrates a one-stop LLM-based agent framework with an augmented computational notebook interface. DataLab supports various BI tasks for different data roles in data preparation, analysis, and visualization by seamlessly combining LLM assistance with user customization within a single environment. To achieve this unification, we design a domain knowledge incorporation module tailored for enterprise-specific BI tasks, an inter-agent communication mechanism to facilitate information sharing across the BI workflow, and a cell-based context management strategy to enhance context utilization efficiency in BI notebooks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DataLab achieves state-of-the-art performance on various BI tasks across popular research benchmarks. Moreover, DataLab maintains high effectiveness and efficiency on real-world datasets from Tencent, achieving up to a 58.58% increase in accuracy and a 61.65% reduction in token cost on enterprise-specific BI tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICDE 2025</p></details> |
| **[M-Prometheus: A Suite of Open Multilingual LLM Judges](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04953v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The use of language models for automatically evaluating long-form text (LLM-as-a-judge) is becoming increasingly common, yet most LLM judges are optimized exclusively for English, with strategies for enhancing their multilingual evaluation capabilities remaining largely unexplored in the current literature. This has created a disparity in the quality of automatic evaluation methods for non-English languages, ultimately hindering the development of models with better multilingual capabilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce M-Prometheus, a suite of open-weight LLM judges ranging from 3B to 14B parameters that can provide both direct assessment and pairwise comparison feedback on multilingual outputs. M-Prometheus models outperform state-of-the-art open LLM judges on multilingual reward benchmarks spanning more than 20 languages, as well as on literary machine translation (MT) evaluation covering 4 language pairs. Furthermore, M-Prometheus models can be leveraged at decoding time to significantly improve generated outputs across all 3 tested languages, showcasing their utility for the development of better multilingual models. Lastly, through extensive ablations, we identify the key factors for obtaining an effective multilingual judge, including backbone model selection and training on natively multilingual feedback data instead of translated data. We release our models, training dataset, and code.</p></details> |  |
| **[AgentSpec: Customizable Runtime Enforcement for Safe and Reliable LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18666v2)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agents built on LLMs are increasingly deployed across diverse domains, automating complex decision-making and task execution. However, their autonomy introduces safety risks, including security vulnerabilities, legal violations, and unintended harmful actions. Existing mitigation methods, such as model-based safeguards and early enforcement strategies, fall short in robustness, interpretability, and adaptability. To address these challenges, we propose AgentSpec, a lightweight domain-specific language for specifying and enforcing runtime constraints on LLM agents. With AgentSpec, users define structured rules that incorporate triggers, predicates, and enforcement mechanisms, ensuring agents operate within predefined safety boundaries. We implement AgentSpec across multiple domains, including code execution, embodied agents, and autonomous driving, demonstrating its adaptability and effectiveness. Our evaluation shows that AgentSpec successfully prevents unsafe executions in over 90% of code agent cases, eliminates all hazardous actions in embodied agent tasks, and enforces 100% compliance by autonomous vehicles (AVs). Despite its strong safety guarantees, AgentSpec remains computationally lightweight, with overheads in milliseconds. By combining interpretability, modularity, and efficiency, AgentSpec provides a practical and scalable solution for enforcing LLM agent safety across diverse applications. We also automate the generation of rules using LLMs and assess their effectiveness. Our evaluation shows that the rules generated by OpenAI o1 achieve a precision of 95.56% and recall of 70.96% for embodied agents, successfully identifying 87.26% of the risky code, and prevent AVs from breaking laws in 5 out of 8 scenarios.</p></details> |  |

As the computational demands of applications evolve, the capabilities and programming interfaces of these fixed-function units continue to change. NVIDIA's Hopper GPU architecture contains multiple fixed-function units per compute unit, including an asynchronous data movement unit (TMA) and an asynchronous matrix multiplication unit (Tensor Core). Efficiently utilizing these units requires a fundamentally different programming style than previous architectures; programmers must now develop warp-specialized kernels that orchestrate producer-consumer pipelines between the asynchronous units. To manage the complexity of programming these new architectures, we introduce Cypress, a task-based programming model with sequential semantics. Cypress programs are a set of designated functions called \emph{tasks} that operate on \emph{tensors} and are free of communication and synchronization. Cypress programs are bound to the target machine through a \emph{mapping} specification that describes where tasks should run and in which memories tensors should be materialized. We present a compiler architecture that lowers Cypress programs into CUDA programs that perform competitively with expert-written codes. Cypress achieves 0.88x-1.06x the performance of cuBLAS on GEMM, and between 0.80x-0.98x the performance of the currently best-known Flash Attention implementation while eliminating all aspects of explicit data movement and asynchronous computation from application code.</p></details> |  |
| **[FCN: Fusing Exponential and Linear Cross Network for Click-Through Rate Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13349v7)** | 2025-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As an important modeling paradigm in click-through rate (CTR) prediction, the Deep & Cross Network (DCN) and its derivative models have gained widespread recognition primarily due to their success in a trade-off between computational cost and performance. This paradigm employs a cross network to explicitly model feature interactions with linear growth, while leveraging deep neural networks (DNN) to implicitly capture higher-order feature interactions. However, these models still face several key limitations: (1) The performance of existing explicit feature interaction methods lags behind that of implicit DNN, resulting in overall model performance being dominated by the DNN; (2) While these models claim to capture high-order feature interactions, they often overlook potential noise within these interactions; (3) The learning process for different interaction network branches lacks appropriate supervision signals; and (4) The high-order feature interactions captured by these models are often implicit and non-interpretable due to their reliance on DNN. To address the identified limitations, this paper proposes a novel model, called Fusing Cross Network (FCN), along with two sub-networks: Linear Cross Network (LCN) and Exponential Cross Network (ECN). FCN explicitly captures feature interactions with both linear and exponential growth, eliminating the need to rely on implicit DNN. Moreover, we introduce the Self-Mask operation to filter noise layer by layer and reduce the number of parameters in the cross network by half. To effectively train these two cross networks, we propose a simple yet effective loss function called Tri-BCE, which provides tailored supervision signals for each network. We evaluate the effectiveness, efficiency, and interpretability of FCN on six benchmark datasets. Furthermore, by integrating LCN and ECN, FCN achieves a new state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |

An $\mathcal{O}(n)$ decomposition for $M_n$ has been proposed recently with $k=3$. However, for an arbitrary value of $k$, no such construction exists even though there are several works reporting continual improvement of lower bounds, finally achieving an optimal lower bound $\Omega(\frac{n}{k}\log k)$ as provided by Lecomte et. al., in CCC '22. In this direction, here we propose two decomposition procedures for $M_n$, utilizing counter trees and restricted partition functions, respectively. The construction technique based on counter tree requires $\mathcal{O}(n)$ such many $M_k$ functions, hence presenting a construction closest to the optimal lower bound, reported so far. The decomposition technique using restricted partition functions present a novel link between Majority Boolean function construction and elementary number theory. These decomposition techniques close a gap in circuit complexity studies and are also useful for leveraging emerging computing technologies.</p></details> |  |

However, prior work primarily relies on few-shot in-context learning (ICL) with ad-hoc demonstrations, which limit program diversity and require manual design with substantial domain knowledge. Fundamentally, the underlying principles of effective reasoning program generation still remain underexplored, making it challenging to construct effective demonstrations. To address this, we propose BOOST, a bootstrapping-based framework for few-shot reasoning program generation. BOOST explicitly integrates claim decomposition and information-gathering strategies as structural guidance for program generation, iteratively refining bootstrapped demonstrations in a strategy-driven and data-centric manner without human intervention. This enables a seamless transition from zero-shot to few-shot strategic program-guided learning, enhancing interpretability and effectiveness. Experimental results show that BOOST outperforms prior few-shot baselines in both zero-shot and few-shot settings for complex claim verification.</p></details> | 18 pages, 5 figures |

While prior research has primarily focused on improving FC accuracy, little attention has been given to the robustness of these agents to perturbations in their input. We introduce a benchmark assessing FC robustness in two key areas: resilience to naturalistic query variations, and stability in function calling when the toolkit expands with semantically related tools. Evaluating best-performing FC models on a carefully expanded subset of the Berkeley function calling leaderboard (BFCL), we identify critical weaknesses in existing evaluation methodologies, and highlight areas for improvement in real-world agentic deployments.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, TrustNLP@NAACL25</p></details> |

While current benchmarks have shown that LLMs can solve tasks using programs like human developers, the majority of their evaluations are limited to short and self-contained algorithmic tasks or standalone function calls. Solving challenging and practical tasks requires the capability of utilizing diverse function calls as tools to efficiently implement functionalities like data analysis and web development. In addition, using multiple tools to solve a task needs compositional reasoning by accurately understanding complex instructions. Fulfilling both of these characteristics can pose a great challenge for LLMs.To assess how well LLMs can solve challenging and practical tasks via programs, we introduce BigCodeBench, a benchmark that challenges LLMs to invoke multiple function calls as tools from 139 libraries and 7 domains for 1,140 fine-grained tasks. To evaluate LLMs rigorously, each task encompasses 5.6 test cases with an average branch coverage of 99%. In addition, we propose a natural-language-oriented variant of BigCodeBench, BigCodeBench-Instruct, that automatically transforms the original docstrings into short instructions only with essential information. Our extensive evaluation of 60 LLMs shows that LLMs are not yet capable of following complex instructions to use function calls precisely, with scores up to 60%, significantly lower than the human performance of 97%. The results underscore the need for further advancements in this area.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accpe...</summary><p>Accpeted at ICLR 2025 (Oral), built with love by the BigCode community :)</p></details> |

Unfortunately, modern applications codebases exhibit highly variant behavior across different inputs, creating challenges for conventional profiling approaches that rely on a single representative execution instance. In this paper, we propose \textbf{Phaedrus}, a new \textit{compiler-assisted deep learning framework} designed to predict dynamic program behaviors across varied execution instances, specifically focusing on dynamic function call prediction.Such predicted call sequences are then used for producing optimized code pertinent to a given input. Traditional profile-guided optimization methods struggle with the input-dependent variability of modern applications, where profiling on different inputs yields divergent application behaviors. To address this, Phaedrus proposes two new approaches: \textit{Application Behavior Synthesis}, a profile-less approach where Large Language Models (LLMs) directly infer dynamic functions based on source code \& static compiler analysis, bypassing the need for traditional profiling, and \textit{Application Profile Generalization}, which uses generative models trained on compressed and augmented \textit{Whole Program Path} (WPP) based function profiles to predict application behavior under unseen inputs. Our experiments show that \textit{Phaedrus} can achieve upto $10^7X$ reduction in WPP function profile sizes, can predict most frequently executed functions that cover upto 85-99\% of the execution time, along with an average of 13.68\% (upto 65\%) reduction in application binary size, and an average of 2.8\% performance improvement over the traditional profile-guided optimization.</p></details> |  |
| **[How Does A Text Preprocessing Pipeline Affect Ontology Syntactic Matching?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03962v5)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The classic text preprocessing pipeline, comprising Tokenisation, Normalisation, Stop Words Removal, and Stemming/Lemmatisation, has been implemented in many systems for syntactic ontology matching (OM). However, the lack of standardisation in text preprocessing creates diversity in mapping results. In this paper we investigate the effect of the text preprocessing pipeline on syntactic OM in 8 Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI) tracks with 49 distinct alignments. We find that Phase 1 text preprocessing (Tokenisation and Normalisation) is more effective than Phase 2 text preprocessing (Stop Words Removal and Stemming/Lemmatisation). To repair the unwanted false mappings caused by Phase 2 text preprocessing, we propose a novel context-based pipeline repair approach that employs a post hoc check to find common words that cause false mappings. These words are stored in a reserved word set and applied in text preprocessing. The experimental results show that our approach improves the matching correctness and the overall matching performance. We then consider the broader integration of the classic text preprocessing pipeline with modern large language models (LLMs) for OM. We recommend that (1) the text preprocessing pipeline be injected via function calling into LLMs to avoid the tendency towards unstable true mappings produced by LLM prompting; or (2) LLMs be used to repair non-existent and counter-intuitive false mappings generated by the text preprocessing pipeline.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 11 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

While large language model agents have shown promise in programming tasks guided by natural language, their ability to perform inductive program synthesis is underexplored. Existing evaluation protocols rely on static sets of examples and held-out tests, offering no feedback when synthesized functions are incorrect and failing to reflect real-world scenarios such as reverse engineering. We propose CodeARC, the Code Abstraction and Reasoning Challenge, a new evaluation framework where agents interact with a hidden target function by querying it with new inputs, synthesizing candidate functions, and iteratively refining their solutions using a differential testing oracle. This interactive setting encourages agents to perform function calls and self-correction based on feedback. We construct the first large-scale benchmark for general-purpose inductive program synthesis, featuring 1114 functions. Among 18 models evaluated, o3-mini performs best with a success rate of 52.7%, highlighting the difficulty of this task. Fine-tuning LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct on curated synthesis traces yields up to a 31% relative performance gain. CodeARC provides a more realistic and challenging testbed for evaluating LLM-based program synthesis and inductive reasoning.</p></details> |  |

Issue localization forms the basis for accurate patch generation. However, because of limitations caused by the context window length of LLMs, existing issue localization methods face challenges in balancing concise yet effective contexts and adequately comprehensive search spaces. In this paper, we introduce CoSIL, an LLM driven, simple yet powerful function level issue localization method without training or indexing. CoSIL reduces the search space through module call graphs, iteratively searches the function call graph to obtain relevant contexts, and uses context pruning to control the search direction and manage contexts effectively. Importantly, the call graph is dynamically constructed by the LLM during search, eliminating the need for pre-parsing. Experiment results demonstrate that CoSIL achieves a Top-1 localization success rate of 43 percent and 44.6 percent on SWE bench Lite and SWE bench Verified, respectively, using Qwen2.5 Coder 32B, outperforming existing methods by 8.6 to 98.2 percent. When CoSIL is applied to guide the patch generation stage, the resolved rate further improves by 9.3 to 31.5 percent.</p></details> |  |

In particular, the runtime of the multi-valued cGA (r-cGA) and UMDA on multi-valued functions has been a significant area of study. Adak and Witt (PPSN 2024) and Hamano et al. (ECJ 2024) independently performed a first runtime analysis of the r-cGA on the r-valued OneMax function (r-OneMax). Adak and Witt also introduced a different r-valued OneMax function called G-OneMax. However, for that function, only empirical results were provided so far due to the increased complexity of its runtime analysis, since r-OneMax involves categorical values of two types only, while G-OneMax encompasses all possible values. In this paper, we present the first theoretical runtime analysis of the r-cGA on the G-OneMax function. We demonstrate that the runtime is O(nr^3 log^2 n log r) with high probability. Additionally, we refine the previously established runtime analysis of the r-cGA on r-OneMax, improving the previous bound to O(nr log n log r), which improves the state of the art by an asymptotic factor of log n and is tight for the binary case. Moreover, we for the first time include the case of frequency borders.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at GECCO 2025</p></details> |

With the growing consumption of content using Over-the-Top platforms, such as Netflix or Prime Video, DRMs have been deployed on numerous devices considered as potential hostile environments. In this paper, we focus on the most widespread solution, the closed-source Widevine DRM. Installed on billions of devices, Widevine relies on cryptographic operations to protect content. Our work presents a study of Widevine internals on Android, mapping its distinct components and bringing out its different cryptographic keys involved in content decryption. We provide a structural view of Widevine as a protocol with its complete key ladder. Based on our insights, we develop WideXtractor, a tool based on Frida to trace Widevine function calls and intercept messages for inspection. Using this tool, we analyze Netflix usage of Widevine as a proof-of-concept, and raised privacy concerns on user-tracking. In addition, we leverage our knowledge to bypass the obfuscation of Android Widevine software-only version, namely L3, and recover its Root-of-Trust.</p></details> |  |

However, when adapting speculative decoding to domain-specific target models, the acceptance rate of the generic draft model drops significantly due to domain shift. In this work, we systematically investigate knowledge distillation techniques for training domain draft models to improve their speculation accuracy. We compare white-box and black-box distillation approaches and explore their effectiveness in various data accessibility scenarios, including historical user queries, curated domain data, and synthetically generated alignment data. Our experiments across Function Calling, Biology, and Chinese domains show that offline distillation consistently outperforms online distillation by 11% to 25%, white-box distillation surpasses black-box distillation by 2% to 10%, and data scaling trends hold across domains. Additionally, we find that synthetic data can effectively align draft models and achieve 80% to 93% of the performance of training on historical user queries. These findings provide practical guidelines for training domain-specific draft models to improve speculative decoding efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a workshop paper at SCOPE - ICLR 2025</p></details> |

Probabilistic Latent Encryption Mapping presents an alternative detection framework that models ransomware-induced encryption behaviors through statistical representations of entropy deviations and probabilistic dependencies in execution traces. Unlike conventional approaches that depend on explicit bytecode analysis or predefined cryptographic function call monitoring, probabilistic inference techniques classify encryption anomalies based on their underlying statistical characteristics, ensuring greater adaptability to polymorphic attack strategies. Evaluations demonstrate that entropy-driven classification reduces false positive rates while maintaining high detection accuracy across diverse ransomware families and encryption methodologies. Experimental results further highlight the framework's ability to differentiate between benign encryption workflows and adversarial cryptographic manipulations, ensuring that classification performance remains effective across cloud-based and localized execution environments. Benchmark comparisons illustrate that probabilistic modeling exhibits advantages over heuristic and machine learning-based detection approaches, particularly in handling previously unseen encryption techniques and adversarial obfuscation strategies. Computational efficiency analysis confirms that detection latency remains within operational feasibility constraints, reinforcing the viability of probabilistic encryption classification for real-time security infrastructures. The ability to systematically infer encryption-induced deviations without requiring static attack signatures strengthens detection robustness against adversarial evasion techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: This paper has been withdrawn by arXiv due to disputed and unverifiable authorship</p></details> |

In the first stage, the passive BD-RIS is designed to minimize the aggregate interference power at all receivers, a cost function called interference leakage (IL). To this end, we propose an optimization algorithm in the manifold of unitary matrices and a suboptimal but computationally efficient solution. In the second stage, users' active precoders are designed under different criteria such as minimizing the IL (min-IL), maximizing the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (max-SINR), or maximizing the sum rate (max-SR). The residual interference not cancelled by the BD-RIS is treated as noise by the precoders. Our simulation results show that the max-SR precoders provide more than 20% sum rate improvement compared to other designs, especially when the BD-RIS has a moderate number of elements ($M<20$) and users transmit with high power, in which case the residual interference is still significant.</p></details> | 13 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Towards Practical Real-Time Neural Video Compression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20762v2)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a practical real-time neural video codec (NVC) designed to deliver high compression ratio, low latency and broad versatility. In practice, the coding speed of NVCs depends on 1) computational costs, and 2) non-computational operational costs, such as memory I/O and the number of function calls. While most efficient NVCs prioritize reducing computational cost, we identify operational cost as the primary bottleneck to achieving higher coding speed. Leveraging this insight, we introduce a set of efficiency-driven design improvements focused on minimizing operational costs. Specifically, we employ implicit temporal modeling to eliminate complex explicit motion modules, and use single low-resolution latent representations rather than progressive downsampling. These innovations significantly accelerate NVC without sacrificing compression quality. Additionally, we implement model integerization for consistent cross-device coding and a module-bank-based rate control scheme to improve practical adaptability. Experiments show our proposed DCVC-RT achieves an impressive average encoding/decoding speed at 125.2/112.8 fps (frames per second) for 1080p video, while saving an average of 21% in bitrate compared to H.266/VTM.

TAPS can effectively obtain surrogate models for high-dimensional parametric problems with equivalent zetta-scale ($10^{21}$) degrees of freedom (DoFs). TAPS achieves this by directly obtaining reduced-order models through solving governing equations with multiple independent variables such as spatial coordinates, parameters, and time. The paper first introduces an AI-enhanced finite element-type interpolation function called convolution hierarchical deep-learning neural network (C-HiDeNN) with tensor decomposition (TD). Subsequently, the generalized space-parameter-time Galerkin weak form and the corresponding matrix form are derived. Through the choice of TAPS hyperparameters, an arbitrary convergence rate can be achieved. To show the capabilities of this framework, TAPS is then used to simulate a large-scale additive manufacturing process as an example and achieves around 1,370x speedup, 14.8x memory savings, and 955x storage gain compared to the finite difference method with $3.46$ billion spatial degrees of freedom (DoFs). As a result, the TAPS framework opens a new avenue for many challenging ultra large-scale engineering problems, such as additive manufacturing and integrated circuit design, among others.</p></details> |  |
| **[Benchmarking LLMs and LLM-based Agents in Practical Vulnerability Detection for Code Repositories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03586v2)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in software vulnerability detection, particularly on function-level benchmarks like Devign and BigVul. However, real-world detection requires interprocedural analysis, as vulnerabilities often emerge through multi-hop function calls rather than isolated functions. While repository-level benchmarks like ReposVul and VulEval introduce interprocedural context, they remain computationally expensive, lack pairwise evaluation of vulnerability fixes, and explore limited context retrieval, limiting their practicality. We introduce JitVul, a JIT vulnerability detection benchmark linking each function to its vulnerability-introducing and fixing commits. Built from 879 CVEs spanning 91 vulnerability types, JitVul enables comprehensive evaluation of detection capabilities. Our results show that ReAct Agents, leveraging thought-action-observation and interprocedural context, perform better than LLMs in distinguishing vulnerable from benign code. While prompting strategies like Chain-of-Thought help LLMs, ReAct Agents require further refinement. Both methods show inconsistencies, either misidentifying vulnerabilities or over-analyzing security guards, indicating significant room for improvement.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cauchy-Schwarz Regularizers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01639v3)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a novel class of regularization functions, called Cauchy-Schwarz (CS) regularizers, which can be designed to induce a wide range of properties in solution vectors of optimization problems. To demonstrate the versatility of CS regularizers, we derive regularization functions that promote discrete-valued vectors, eigenvectors of a given matrix, and orthogonal matrices. The resulting CS regularizers are simple, differentiable, and can be free of spurious stationary points, making them suitable for gradient-based solvers and large-scale optimization problems. In addition, CS regularizers automatically adapt to the appropriate scale, which is, for example, beneficial when discretizing the weights of neural networks. To demonstrate the efficacy of CS regularizers, we provide results for solving underdetermined systems of linear equations and weight quantization in neural networks. Furthermore, we discuss specializations, variations, and generalizations, which lead to an even broader class of new and possibly more powerful regularizers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025</p></details> |

We introduce TxAgent, an AI agent that leverages multi-step reasoning and real-time biomedical knowledge retrieval across a toolbox of 211 tools to analyze drug interactions, contraindications, and patient-specific treatment strategies. TxAgent evaluates how drugs interact at molecular, pharmacokinetic, and clinical levels, identifies contraindications based on patient comorbidities and concurrent medications, and tailors treatment strategies to individual patient characteristics. It retrieves and synthesizes evidence from multiple biomedical sources, assesses interactions between drugs and patient conditions, and refines treatment recommendations through iterative reasoning. It selects tools based on task objectives and executes structured function calls to solve therapeutic tasks that require clinical reasoning and cross-source validation. The ToolUniverse consolidates 211 tools from trusted sources, including all US FDA-approved drugs since 1939 and validated clinical insights from Open Targets. TxAgent outperforms leading LLMs, tool-use models, and reasoning agents across five new benchmarks: DrugPC, BrandPC, GenericPC, TreatmentPC, and DescriptionPC, covering 3,168 drug reasoning tasks and 456 personalized treatment scenarios. It achieves 92.1% accuracy in open-ended drug reasoning tasks, surpassing GPT-4o and outperforming DeepSeek-R1 (671B) in structured multi-step reasoning. TxAgent generalizes across drug name variants and descriptions. By integrating multi-step inference, real-time knowledge grounding, and tool-assisted decision-making, TxAgent ensures that treatment recommendations align with established clinical guidelines and real-world evidence, reducing the risk of adverse events and improving therapeutic decision-making.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://zitniklab.hms.harvard.edu/TxAgent TxAgent code: https://github.com/mims-harvard/TxAgent ToolUniverse code: https://github.com/mims-harvard/ToolUniverse</p></details> |
| **[Graph-Grounded LLMs: Leveraging Graphical Function Calling to Minimize LLM Hallucinations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10941v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) is rapidly expanding across various tasks that involve inherent graphical structures. Graphs are integral to a wide range of applications, including motion planning for autonomous vehicles, social networks, scene understanding, and knowledge graphs. Many problems, even those not initially perceived as graph-based, can be effectively addressed through graph theory. However, when applied to these tasks, LLMs often encounter challenges, such as hallucinations and mathematical inaccuracies. To overcome these limitations, we propose Graph-Grounded LLMs, a system that improves LLM performance on graph-related tasks by integrating a graph library through function calls. By grounding LLMs in this manner, we demonstrate significant reductions in hallucinations and improved mathematical accuracy in solving graph-based problems, as evidenced by the performance on the NLGraph benchmark. Finally, we showcase a disaster rescue application where the Graph-Grounded LLM acts as a decision-support system.</p></details> |  |
| **[LightPlanner: Unleashing the Reasoning Capabilities of Lightweight Large Language Models in Task Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08508v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, lightweight large language models (LLMs) have garnered significant attention in the robotics field due to their low computational resource requirements and suitability for edge deployment. However, in task planning -- particularly for complex tasks that involve dynamic semantic logic reasoning -- lightweight LLMs have underperformed. To address this limitation, we propose a novel task planner, LightPlanner, which enhances the performance of lightweight LLMs in complex task planning by fully leveraging their reasoning capabilities. Unlike conventional planners that use fixed skill templates, LightPlanner controls robot actions via parameterized function calls, dynamically generating parameter values. This approach allows for fine-grained skill control and improves task planning success rates in complex scenarios. Furthermore, we introduce hierarchical deep reasoning. Before generating each action decision step, LightPlanner thoroughly considers three levels: action execution (feedback verification), semantic parsing (goal consistency verification), and parameter generation (parameter validity verification). This ensures the correctness of subsequent action controls. Additionally, we incorporate a memory module to store historical actions, thereby reducing context length and enhancing planning efficiency for long-term tasks. We train the LightPlanner-1.5B model on our LightPlan-40k dataset, which comprises 40,000 action controls across tasks with 2 to 13 action steps. Experiments demonstrate that our model achieves the highest task success rate despite having the smallest number of parameters. In tasks involving spatial semantic reasoning, the success rate exceeds that of ReAct by 14.9 percent. Moreover, we demonstrate LightPlanner's potential to operate on edge devices.</p></details> |  |
| **[RefactorBench: Evaluating Stateful Reasoning in Language Agents Through Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07832v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in language model (LM) agents and function calling have enabled autonomous, feedback-driven systems to solve problems across various digital domains. To better understand the unique limitations of LM agents, we introduce RefactorBench, a benchmark consisting of 100 large handcrafted multi-file refactoring tasks in popular open-source repositories. Solving tasks within RefactorBench requires thorough exploration of dependencies across multiple files and strong adherence to relevant instructions. Every task is defined by 3 natural language instructions of varying specificity and is mutually exclusive, allowing for the creation of longer combined tasks on the same repository. Baselines on RefactorBench reveal that current LM agents struggle with simple compositional tasks, solving only 22% of tasks with base instructions, in contrast to a human developer with short time constraints solving 87%. Through trajectory analysis, we identify various unique failure modes of LM agents, and further explore the failure mode of tracking past actions. By adapting a baseline agent to condition on representations of state, we achieve a 43.9% improvement in solving RefactorBench tasks. We further extend our state-aware approach to encompass entire digital environments and outline potential directions for future research. RefactorBench aims to support the study of LM agents by providing a set of real-world, multi-hop tasks within the realm of code.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025 Camera Ready</p></details> |

However, their performance may be limited in complex, multi-turn interactions involving users and multiple tools. To address this, we propose Magnet, a principled framework for synthesizing high-quality training trajectories to enhance the function calling capability of large language model agents in multi-turn conversations with humans. The framework is based on automatic and iterative translations from a function signature path to a sequence of queries and executable function calls. We model the complicated function interactions in multi-turn cases with graph and design novel node operations to build reliable signature paths. Motivated by context distillation, when guiding the generation of positive and negative trajectories using a teacher model, we provide reference function call sequences as positive hints in context and contrastive, incorrect function calls as negative hints. Experiments show that training with the positive trajectories with supervised fine-tuning and preference optimization against negative trajectories, our 14B model, Magnet-14B-mDPO, obtains 68.01 on BFCL-v3 and 73.30 on ToolQuery, surpassing the performance of the teacher model Gemini-1.5-pro-002 by a large margin in function calling.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 3 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

Our framework addresses a critical gap in the web agent ecosystem with a production-ready solution that combines minimal serverless backend configuration, intuitive user and browser interfaces, and extensible research capabilities in agent planning, memory, and tree search. For the core LiteWebAgent agent framework, we implemented a simple yet effective baseline using recursive function calling, providing with decoupled action generation and action grounding. In addition, we integrate advanced research components such as agent planning, agent workflow memory, and tree search in a modular and extensible manner. We then integrate the LiteWebAgent agent framework with frontend and backend as deployed systems in two formats: (1) a production Vercel-based web application, which provides users with an agent-controlled remote browser, (2) a Chrome extension leveraging LiteWebAgent's API to control an existing Chrome browser via CDP (Chrome DevTools Protocol). The LiteWebAgent framework is available at https://github.com/PathOnAI/LiteWebAgent, with deployed frontend at https://lite-web-agent.vercel.app/.</p></details> |  |
| **[CoCoNUT: Structural Code Understanding does not fall out of a tree](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16456v3)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance across a wide array of tasks involving both structured and unstructured textual data. Recent results on various benchmarks for code generation, repair, or completion suggest that certain models have programming abilities comparable to or even surpass humans. In this work, we demonstrate that high performance on such benchmarks does not correlate to humans' innate ability to understand structural control flow in code. To this end, we extract solutions from the HumanEval benchmark, which the relevant models perform strongly on, and trace their execution path using function calls sampled from the respective test set. Using this dataset, we investigate the ability of seven state-of-the-art LLMs to match the execution trace and find that, despite their ability to generate semantically identical code, they possess limited ability to trace execution paths, especially for longer traces and specific control structures. We find that even the top-performing model, Gemini, can fully and correctly generate only 47% of HumanEval task traces. Additionally, we introduce a subset for three key structures not contained in HumanEval: Recursion, Parallel Processing, and Object-Oriented Programming, including concepts like Inheritance and Polymorphism. Besides OOP, we show that none of the investigated models achieve an accuracy over 5% on the relevant traces. Aggregating these specialized parts with HumanEval tasks, we present CoCoNUT: Code Control Flow for Navigation Understanding and Testing, which measures a model's ability to trace execution of code upon relevant calls, including advanced structural components. We conclude that current LLMs need significant improvement to enhance code reasoning abilities. We hope our dataset helps researchers bridge this gap.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 2025 IEEE/ACM International Workshop on Large Language Models for Code (LLM4Code)</p></details> |

Programmers are required by regulations or application stores to provide privacy notices and labels describing these privacy behaviors. Although many tools and research prototypes have been developed to help programmers generate these notices by analyzing the source code, these approaches are often fairly coarse-grained (i.e., at the level of whole methods or files, rather than at the statement level). But this is not necessarily how privacy behaviors exist in code. Privacy behaviors are embedded in specific statements in code. Current literature does not examine what statements programmers see as most important, how consistent these views are, or how to detect them. In this paper, we conduct an empirical study to examine which statements programmers view as most-related to privacy behaviors. We find that expression statements that make function calls are most associated with privacy behaviors, while the type of privacy label has little effect on the attributes of the selected statements. We then propose an approach to automatically detect these privacy-relevant statements by fine-tuning three large language models with the data from the study. We observe that the agreement between our approach and participants is comparable to or higher than an agreement between two participants. Our study and detection approach can help programmers understand which statements in code affect privacy in mobile applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 8 figures, under review</p></details> |

Existing approaches rely on expensive human annotation, making them unsustainable at scale. We propose AgentTrek, a scalable data synthesis pipeline that generates web agent trajectories by leveraging publicly available tutorials. Our three-stage method: (1) automatically harvests and filters tutorial-like texts from the internet using a specialized classification model, (2) transforms these texts into structured task specifications with step-by-step instructions, and (3) employs a visual-language model (VLM) agent to execute these instructions in real environments, while a VLM-based evaluator verifies trajectory correctness. The synthesized trajectories encompass multiple modalities, including text-based HTML observations with function-calling API actions, and vision-based screenshot observations with pixel-level actions. This multimodal data, enriched with chain-of-thought reasoning, enables agents to achieve state-of-the-art performance on both textual web browsing benchmarks (e.g., WebArena) and visual web grounding and browsing benchmarks (e.g., ScreenSpot Web and Multimodal Mind2Web). Furthermore, our fully automated approach significantly reduces data collection costs, achieving a cost of just $0.55 per high-quality trajectory without human annotators. Our work demonstrates that guided replay using web tutorials is a practical and scalable strategy for training advanced GUI agents, paving the way for more capable and autonomous digital assistants.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR2...</summary><p>ICLR2025 Spotlight https://agenttrek.github.io</p></details> |

While current research on function calling by LLMs primarily focuses on single-turn interactions, this paper addresses the overlooked necessity for LLMs to engage in multi-turn function calling--critical for handling compositional, real-world queries that require planning with functions but not only use functions. To facilitate this, we introduce an approach, BUTTON, which generates synthetic compositional instruction tuning data via bottom-up instruction construction and top-down trajectory generation. In the bottom-up phase, we generate simple atomic tasks based on real-world scenarios and build compositional tasks using heuristic strategies based on atomic tasks. Corresponding function definitions are then synthesized for these compositional tasks. The top-down phase features a multi-agent environment where interactions among simulated humans, assistants, and tools are utilized to gather multi-turn function calling trajectories. This approach ensures task compositionality and allows for effective function and trajectory generation by examining atomic tasks within compositional tasks. We produce a dataset BUTTONInstruct comprising 8k data points and demonstrate its effectiveness through extensive experiments across various LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025</p></details> |

At the same time, large copyright lawsuits and legislation such as GDPR have highlighted the need for erasing datapoints from diffusion models. However, retraining from scratch is often too expensive. This motivates the setting of data unlearning, i.e., the study of efficient techniques for unlearning specific datapoints from the training set. Existing concept unlearning techniques require an anchor prompt/class/distribution to guide unlearning, which is not available in the data unlearning setting. General-purpose machine unlearning techniques were found to be either unstable or failed to unlearn data. We therefore propose a family of new loss functions called Subtracted Importance Sampled Scores (SISS) that utilize importance sampling and are the first method to unlearn data with theoretical guarantees. SISS is constructed as a weighted combination between simpler objectives that are responsible for preserving model quality and unlearning the targeted datapoints. When evaluated on CelebA-HQ and MNIST, SISS achieved Pareto optimality along the quality and unlearning strength dimensions. On Stable Diffusion, SISS successfully mitigated memorization on nearly 90% of the prompts we tested.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

To mitigate the distribution shift commonly observed in ORL problems, we further employ a robust and non-causal Model Predictive Control (MPC) expert steering a nominal model of the dynamics using in-hindsight information stemming from the model mismatch. Unlike the existing literature, our robust MPC expert enjoys an exact and tractable convex reformulation. In the second part of this study, we show that the IO hypothesis class, trained by the proposed convex loss function, enjoys ample expressiveness and achieves competitive performance comparing with the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in the low-data regime of the MuJoCo benchmark while utilizing three orders of magnitude fewer parameters, thereby requiring significantly fewer computational resources. To facilitate the reproducibility of our results, we provide an open-source package implementing the proposed algorithms and the experiments.</p></details> | preprint |

To mitigate these challenges, local smaller models are often deployed alongside larger models, relying on routing and deferral mechanisms to offload complex tasks. However, existing approaches inadequately balance the capabilities of these models, often resulting in unnecessary deferrals or sub-optimal resource usage. In this work we introduce a novel loss function called Gatekeeper for calibrating smaller models in cascade setups. Our approach fine-tunes the smaller model to confidently handle tasks it can perform correctly while deferring complex tasks to the larger model. Moreover, it incorporates a mechanism for managing the trade-off between model performance and deferral accuracy, and is broadly applicable across various tasks and domains without any architectural changes. We evaluate our method on encoder-only, decoder-only, and encoder-decoder architectures. Experiments across image classification, language modeling, and vision-language tasks show that our approach substantially improves deferral performance.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing approaches focus on mainstream languages such as Python and Java, neglecting the Solidity language, the predominant programming language for Ethereum smart contracts. Due to the lack of adequate benchmarks for Solidity, LLMs' ability to generate secure, cost-effective smart contracts remains unexplored. To fill this gap, we construct SolEval, the first repository-level benchmark designed for Solidity smart contract generation, to evaluate the performance of LLMs on Solidity. SolEval consists of 1,125 samples from 9 different repositories, covering 6 popular domains, providing LLMs with a comprehensive evaluation benchmark. Unlike the existing Solidity benchmark, SolEval not only includes complex function calls but also reflects the real-world complexity of the Ethereum ecosystem by incorporating gas fee and vulnerability rate. We evaluate 10 LLMs on SolEval, and our results show that the best-performing LLM achieves only 26.29% Pass@10, highlighting substantial room for improvement in Solidity code generation by LLMs. We release our data and code at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/SolEval-1C06/.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Simple Introduction to the SiMPL Method for Density-Based Topology Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19421v3)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a novel method for solving density-based topology optimization problems: Sigmoidal Mirror descent with a Projected Latent variable (SiMPL). The SiMPL method (pronounced as ``the simple method'') optimizes a design using only first-order derivative information of the objective function. The bound constraints on the density field are enforced with the help of the (negative) Fermi--Dirac entropy, which is also used to define a non-symmetric distance function called a Bregman divergence on the set of admissible designs. This Bregman divergence leads to a simple update rule that is further simplified with the help of a so-called latent variable. Because the SiMPL method involves discretizing the latent variable, it produces a sequence of pointwise-feasible iterates, even when high-order finite elements are used in the discretization. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the method outperforms other popular first-order optimization algorithms. To outline the general applicability of the technique, we include examples with (self-load) compliance minimization and compliant mechanism optimization problems.</p></details> |  |

CoALM: A Unified Conversational Agentic Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08820v3)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) with API-calling capabilities enabled building effective Language Agents (LA), while also revolutionizing the conventional task-oriented dialogue (TOD) paradigm. However, current approaches face a critical dilemma: TOD systems are often trained on a limited set of target APIs, requiring new data to maintain their quality when interfacing with new services, while LAs are not trained to maintain user intent over multi-turn conversations. Because both robust multi-turn management and advanced function calling are crucial for effective conversational agents, we evaluate these skills on three popular benchmarks: MultiWOZ 2.4 (TOD), BFCL V3 (LA), and API-Bank (LA), and our analyses reveal that specialized approaches excel in one domain but underperform in the other. To bridge this chasm, we introduce CoALM (Conversational Agentic Language Model), a unified approach that integrates both conversational and agentic capabilities. We created CoALM-IT, a carefully constructed multi-task dataset that interleave multi-turn ReAct reasoning with complex API usage. Using CoALM-IT, we train three models CoALM 8B, CoALM 70B, and CoALM 405B, which outperform top domain-specific models, including GPT-4o, across all three benchmarks. This demonstrates the feasibility of a single model approach for both TOD and LA, setting a new standard for conversational agents.</p></details> |  |

Detecting and identifying families as early as possible provides an edge in protecting against such malware. We explore a lightweight, order-invariant approach to detecting and mitigating malware threats: analyzing API calls without regard to their sequence. We publish a public dataset of over three hundred thousand samples and their function call parameters for this task, annotated with labels indicating benign or malicious activity. The complete dataset is above 550GB uncompressed in size. We leverage machine learning algorithms, such as random forests, and conduct behavioral analysis by examining patterns and anomalies in API call sequences. By investigating how the function calls occur regardless of their order, we can identify discriminating features that can help us identify malware early on. The models we've developed are not only effective but also efficient. They are lightweight and can run on any machine with minimal performance overhead, while still achieving an impressive F1-Score of over 85\%. We also empirically show that we only need a subset of the function call sequence, specifically calls to the ntdll.dll library, to identify malware. Our research demonstrates the efficacy of this approach through empirical evaluations, underscoring its accuracy and scalability. The code is open source and available at Github along with the dataset on Zenodo.</p></details> |  |

| **[FlexFL: Flexible and Effective Fault Localization with Open-Source Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10714v2)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the impressive code comprehension ability of Large Language Models (LLMs), a few studies have proposed to leverage LLMs to locate bugs, i.e., LLM-based FL, and demonstrated promising performance. However, first, these methods are limited in flexibility. They rely on bug-triggering test cases to perform FL and cannot make use of other available bug-related information, e.g., bug reports. Second, they are built upon proprietary LLMs, which are, although powerful, confronted with risks in data privacy. To address these limitations, we propose a novel LLM-based FL framework named FlexFL, which can flexibly leverage different types of bug-related information and effectively work with open-source LLMs. FlexFL is composed of two stages. In the first stage, FlexFL reduces the search space of buggy code using state-of-the-art FL techniques of different families and provides a candidate list of bug-related methods. In the second stage, FlexFL leverages LLMs to delve deeper to double-check the code snippets of methods suggested by the first stage and refine fault localization results. In each stage, FlexFL constructs agents based on open-source LLMs, which share the same pipeline that does not postulate any type of bug-related information and can interact with function calls without the out-of-the-box capability. Extensive experimental results on Defects4J demonstrate that FlexFL outperforms the baselines and can work with different open-source LLMs. Specifically, FlexFL with a lightweight open-source LLM Llama3-8B can locate 42 and 63 more bugs than two state-of-the-art LLM-based FL approaches AutoFL and AgentFL that both use GPT-3.5.</p></details> | 17 pages, 4 figures |

This task supports various reverse engineering applications, such as vulnerability identification, malware analysis, and legacy software migration. The end-to-end decompile method based on large langauge models (LLMs) reduces reliance on additional tools and minimizes manual intervention due to its inherent properties. However, previous end-to-end methods often lose critical information necessary for reconstructing control flow structures and variables when processing binary files, making it challenging to accurately recover the program's logic. To address these issues, we propose the \textbf{ReF Decompile} method, which incorporates the following innovations: (1) The Relabelling strategy replaces jump target addresses with labels, preserving control flow clarity. (2) The Function Call strategy infers variable types and retrieves missing variable information from binary files. Experimental results on the Humaneval-Decompile Benchmark demonstrate that ReF Decompile surpasses comparable baselines and achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance of $61.43\%$.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce HammerBench, a novel benchmark framework for assessing LLMs' function-calling capabilities in real-world, multi-turn dialogues. HammerBench simulates diverse mobile assistant use cases, incorporating imperfect instructions, dynamic question-answer trajectories, intent and argument shifts, and the indirect use of external information through pronouns. To construct this benchmark, we curate a comprehensive dataset derived from popular mobile app functionalities and anonymized user logs, complemented by a cost-effective data generation pipeline leveraging open-source models. HammerBench is further augmented with fine-grained interaction snapshots and metrics, enabling detailed evaluation of function-calling performance across individual conversational turns. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HammerBench by evaluating several leading LLMs and uncovering key performance trends. Our experiments reveal that different types of parameter name errors are a significant source of failure across different interaction scenarios, highlighting critical areas for further improvement in LLM robustness for mobile assistant applications.</p></details> |  |

Integrating AI agents into CRM systems can automate routine processes and enhance personalized service. However, deploying and evaluating these agents is challenging due to the lack of realistic benchmarks that reflect the complexity of real-world CRM tasks. To address this issue, we introduce CRMArena, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate AI agents on realistic tasks grounded in professional work environments. Following guidance from CRM experts and industry best practices, we designed CRMArena with nine customer service tasks distributed across three personas: service agent, analyst, and manager. The benchmark includes 16 commonly used industrial objects (e.g., account, order, knowledge article, case) with high interconnectivity, along with latent variables (e.g., complaint habits, policy violations) to simulate realistic data distributions. Experimental results reveal that state-of-the-art LLM agents succeed in less than 40% of the tasks with ReAct prompting, and less than 55% even with function-calling abilities. Our findings highlight the need for enhanced agent capabilities in function-calling and rule-following to be deployed in real-world work environments. CRMArena is an open challenge to the community: systems that can reliably complete tasks showcase direct business value in a popular work environment.</p></details> | NAACL 2025 |

In recent years, in order to apply MPL in more practical scenarios, various MPC-friendly models have been proposedto reduce the extraordinary communication overhead of MPL. Within the optimization of MPC-friendly models, a critical element to tackle the challenge is profiling the communication cost of models. However, the current solutions mainly depend on manually establishing the profiles to identify communication bottlenecks of models, often involving burdensome human efforts in a monotonous procedure. In this paper, we propose HawkEye, a static model communication cost profiling framework, which enables model designers to get the accurate communication cost of models in MPL frameworks without dynamically running the secure model training or inference processes on a specific MPL framework. Firstly, to profile the communication cost of models with complex structures, we propose a static communication cost profiling method based on a prefix structure that records the function calling chain during the static analysis. Secondly, HawkEye employs an automatic differentiation library to assist model designers in profiling the communication cost of models in PyTorch. Finally, we compare the static profiling results of HawkEye against the profiling results obtained through dynamically running secure model training and inference processes on five popular MPL frameworks, CryptFlow2, CrypTen, Delphi, Cheetah, and SecretFlow-SEMI2K. The experimental results show that HawkEye can accurately profile the model communication cost without dynamic profiling.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for publication at USENIX Security 2025.

| **[Combining Evidence Across Filtrations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09698v3)** | 2025-02-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In sequential anytime-valid inference, any admissible procedure must be based on e-processes: generalizations of test martingales that quantify the accumulated evidence against a composite null hypothesis at any stopping time. This paper proposes a method for combining e-processes constructed in different filtrations but for the same null. Although e-processes in the same filtration can be combined effortlessly (by averaging), e-processes in different filtrations cannot because their validity in a coarser filtration does not translate to a finer filtration. This issue arises in sequential tests of randomness and independence, as well as in the evaluation of sequential forecasters. We establish that a class of functions called adjusters can lift arbitrary e-processes across filtrations. The result yields a generally applicable "adjust-then-combine" procedure, which we demonstrate on the problem of testing randomness in real-world financial data. Furthermore, we prove a characterization theorem for adjusters that formalizes a sense in which using adjusters is necessary. There are two major implications. First, if we have a powerful e-process in a coarsened filtration, then we readily have a powerful e-process in the original filtration. Second, when we coarsen the filtration to construct an e-process, there is a logarithmic cost to recovering validity in the original filtration.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review.

However, existing environments are often domain-specific and require complex setups, which limits agent development and evaluation in real-world settings. As a result, current evaluations lack in-depth analyses that decompose fundamental agent capabilities. We introduce AgentStudio, a trinity of environments, tools, and benchmarks to address these issues. AgentStudio provides a lightweight, interactive environment with highly generic observation and action spaces, e.g., video observations and GUI/API actions. It integrates tools for creating online benchmark tasks, annotating GUI elements, and labeling actions in videos. Based on our environment and tools, we curate an online task suite that benchmarks both GUI interactions and function calling with efficient auto-evaluation. We also reorganize existing datasets and collect new ones using our tools to establish three datasets: GroundUI, IDMBench, and CriticBench. These datasets evaluate fundamental agent abilities, including GUI grounding, learning from videos, and success detection, pointing to the desiderata for robust, general, and open-ended virtual agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025.

This paper introduces and analyzes overthinking in LRMs. A phenomenon where models favor extended internal reasoning chains over environmental interaction. Through experiments on software engineering tasks using SWE Bench Verified, we observe three recurring patterns: Analysis Paralysis, Rogue Actions, and Premature Disengagement. We propose a framework to study these behaviors, which correlates with human expert assessments, and analyze 4018 trajectories. We observe that higher overthinking scores correlate with decreased performance, with reasoning models exhibiting stronger tendencies toward overthinking compared to non-reasoning models. Our analysis reveals that simple efforts to mitigate overthinking in agentic environments, such as selecting the solution with the lower overthinking score, can improve model performance by almost 30% while reducing computational costs by 43%. These results suggest that mitigating overthinking has strong practical implications. We suggest that by leveraging native function-calling capabilities and selective reinforcement learning overthinking tendencies could be mitigated. We also open-source our evaluation framework and dataset to facilitate research in this direction at https://github.com/AlexCuadron/Overthinking.</p></details> |  |

It allows software engineers to develop cloud applications as a set of functions (called serverless functions). However, accurately measuring the performance (i.e., end-to-end response latency) of serverless functions is challenging due to the highly dynamic nature of the environment in which they run. To tackle this problem, a potential solution is to apply checks of performance testing techniques to determine how many repetitions of a given serverless function across a range of inputs are needed to cater to the performance fluctuation. However, the available literature lacks performance testing approaches designed explicitly for serverless computing. In this paper, we propose SCOPE, the first serverless computing-oriented performance testing approach. SCOPE takes into account the unique performance characteristics of serverless functions, such as their short execution durations and on-demand triggering. As such, SCOPE is designed as a fine-grained analysis approach. SCOPE incorporates the accuracy check and the consistency check to obtain the accurate and reliable performance of serverless functions. The evaluation shows that SCOPE provides testing results with 97.25% accuracy, 33.83 percentage points higher than the best currently available technique. Moreover, the superiority of SCOPE over the state-of-the-art holds on all functions that we study.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology (TOSEM)</p></details> |

Building upon the Llama 3.2 model family, we continue the pre-training of Breeze2 on an extensive corpus to enhance the linguistic and cultural heritage of Traditional Chinese. In addition to language modeling capabilities, we significantly augment the models with function calling and vision understanding capabilities. At the time of this publication, as far as we are aware, absent reasoning-inducing prompts, Breeze2 are the strongest performing models in Traditional Chinese function calling and image understanding in its size class. The effectiveness of Breeze2 is benchmarked across various tasks, including Taiwan general knowledge, instruction-following, long context, function calling, and vision understanding. We are publicly releasing all Breeze2 models under the Llama 3.2 Community License. We also showcase the capabilities of the model running on mobile platform with a mobile application which we also open source.</p></details> |  |

We introduce Hephaestus-Forge, the first large-scale pre-training corpus designed to enhance the fundamental capabilities of LLM agents in API function calling, intrinsic reasoning and planning, and adapting to environmental feedback. Hephaestus-Forge comprises 103B agent-specific data encompassing 76,537 APIs, including both tool documentation to introduce knowledge of API functions and function calling trajectories to strengthen intrinsic reasoning. To explore effective training protocols, we investigate scaling laws to identify the optimal recipe in data mixing ratios. By continual pre-training on Hephaestus-Forge, Hephaestus outperforms small- to medium-scale open-source LLMs and rivals commercial LLMs on three agent benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our pre-training corpus in enhancing fundamental agentic capabilities and generalization of LLMs to new tasks or environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NAACL 2025 main conference</p></details> |
| **[Interactive Task Planning with Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10645v2)** | 2025-02-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An interactive robot framework accomplishes long-horizon task planning and can easily generalize to new goals and distinct tasks, even during execution. However, most traditional methods require predefined module design, making it hard to generalize to different goals. Recent large language model based approaches can allow for more open-ended planning but often require heavy prompt engineering or domain specific pretrained models. To tackle this, we propose a simple framework that achieves interactive task planning with language models by incorporating both high-level planning and low-level skill execution through function calling, leveraging pretrained vision models to ground the scene in language. We verify the robustness of our system on the real world task of making milk tea drinks. Our system is able to generate novel high-level instructions for unseen objectives and successfully accomplishes user tasks. Furthermore, when the user sends a new request, our system is able to replan accordingly with precision based on the new request, task guidelines and previously executed steps. Our approach is easy to adapt to different tasks by simply substituting the task guidelines, without the need for additional complex prompt engineering.

| **[Optimal Neural Network Approximation for High-Dimensional Continuous Functions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02363v3)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, the authors of Shen Yang Zhang (JMLR, 2022) developed a neural network with width $36d(2d + 1)$ and depth $11$, which utilizes a special activation function called the elementary universal activation function, to achieve the super approximation property for functions in $C([a,b]^d)$. That is, the constructed network only requires a fixed number of neurons (and thus parameters) to approximate a $d$-variate continuous function on a $d$-dimensional hypercube with arbitrary accuracy. More specifically, only $\mathcal{O}(d^2)$ neurons or parameters are used. One natural question is whether we can reduce the number of these neurons or parameters in such a network. By leveraging a variant of the Kolmogorov Superposition Theorem, our analysis shows that there is a neural network generated by the elementary universal activation function with at most $10889d+10887$ unique nonzero parameters such that this super approximation property is attained. Furthermore, we present a family of continuous functions that requires at least width $d$, and thus at least $d$ neurons or parameters, to achieve arbitrary accuracy in its approximation. This suggests that the number of unique nonzero parameters is optimal in the sense that it grows linearly with the input dimension $d$, unlike some approximation methods where parameters may grow exponentially with $d$.</p></details> |  |
| **[Following Devils' Footprint: Towards Real-time Detection of Price Manipulation Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03718v1)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Price manipulation attack is one of the notorious threats in decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, which allows attackers to exchange tokens at an extensively deviated price from the market. Existing efforts usually rely on reactive methods to identify such kind of attacks after they have happened, e.g., detecting attack transactions in the post-attack stage, which cannot mitigate or prevent price manipulation attacks timely. From the perspective of attackers, they usually need to deploy attack contracts in the pre-attack stage. Thus, if we can identify these attack contracts in a proactive manner, we can raise alarms and mitigate the threats. With the core idea in mind, in this work, we shift our attention from the victims to the attackers. Specifically, we propose SMARTCAT, a novel approach for identifying price manipulation attacks in the pre-attack stage proactively. For generality, it conducts analysis on bytecode and does not require any source code and transaction data. For accuracy, it depicts the control- and data-flow dependency relationships among function calls into a token flow graph. For scalability, it filters out those suspicious paths, in which it conducts inter-contract analysis as necessary. To this end, SMARTCAT can pinpoint attacks in real time once they have been deployed on a chain. The evaluation results illustrate that SMARTCAT significantly outperforms existing baselines with 91.6% recall and ~100% precision. Moreover, SMARTCAT also uncovers 616 attack contracts in-the-wild, accounting for \$9.25M financial losses, with only 19 cases publicly reported. By applying SMARTCAT as a real-time detector in Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain, it has raised 14 alarms 99 seconds after the corresponding deployment on average. These attacks have already led to $641K financial losses, and seven of them are still waiting for their ripe time.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear on the Usenix Security 2025</p></details> |
| **[Approximating Competitive Equilibrium by Nash Welfare](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09994v2)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We explore the relationship between two popular concepts in the allocation of divisible items: competitive equilibrium (CE) and allocations with maximum Nash welfare, i.e., allocations where the weighted geometric mean of the utilities is maximal. When agents have homogeneous concave utility functions, these two concepts coincide: the classical Eisenberg-Gale convex program that maximizes Nash welfare over feasible allocations yields a competitive equilibrium. However, these two concepts diverge for non-homogeneous utilities. From a computational perspective, maximizing Nash welfare amounts to solving a convex program for any concave utility functions, computing CE becomes PPAD-hard already for separable piecewise linear concave (SPLC) utilities. We introduce the concept of Gale-substitute utility functions, which is an analogue of the weak gross substitutes (WGS) property for the so-called Gale demand system. For Gale-substitutes utilities, we show that any allocation maximizing Nash welfare provides an approximate-CE with surprisingly strong guarantees, where every agent gets at least half the maximum utility they can get at any CE, and is approximately envy-free. Gale-substitutes include utility functions where computing CE is PPAD hard, such as all separable concave utilities and the previously studied non-separable class of Leontief-free utilities. We introduce a broad new class of utility functions called generalized network utilities based on the generalized flow model. This class includes SPLC and Leontief-free utilities, and we show that all such utilities are Gale-substitutes. Conversely, although some agents may get much higher utility at a Nash welfare maximizing allocation than at a CE, we show a price of anarchy type result: for general concave utilities, every CE achieves at least $(1/e)^{1/e} > 0.69$ fraction of the maximum Nash welfare, and this factor is tight.</p></details> |  |

While LLMs have been effective for code generation, recent work has shown that PBE is challenging but improvable by fine-tuning, especially with training data drawn from the same distribution as evaluation data. In this paper, we create a conceptual framework of what constitutes a "similar distribution" for SLI and propose four kinds of synthetic data generation methods with varying amounts of inductive bias to investigate what leads to the best performance. Based on the results we create a SOTA open-source model for SLI as PBE (+6% pass rate with a third of the parameters of the second-best LLM) and also highlight exciting future directions for PBE research.</p></details> |  |

| **[Querying Databases with Function Calling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00032v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly accelerating largely thanks to their integration with external tools. Querying databases is among the most effective of these integrations, enabling LLMs to access private or continually updating data. While Function Calling is the most common method for interfacing external tools to LLMs, its application to database querying as a tool has been underexplored. We propose a tool definition for database querying that unifies accessing data with search queries, filters, or a combination both, as well as transforming results with aggregation and groupby operators. To evaluate its effectiveness, we conduct a study with 8 LLMs spanning 5 model families. We present a novel pipeline adapting the Gorilla LLM framework to create synthetic database schemas and queries. We primarily evaluate the models with the Exact Match of predicted and ground truth query APIs. Among the models tested, Claude 3.5 Sonnet achieves the highest performance with an Exact Match score of 74.3%, followed by GPT-4o mini at 73.7%, and GPT-4o at 71.8%. We further breakdown these results per API component utilized and across synthetic use cases. We find that LLMs are highly effective at utilizing operators on boolean properties, but struggle with text property filters. Across use cases we find robust results with the higher performing models such as GPT-4o, but significant performance variance across use cases from lower performing models. We additionally conduct ablation studies exploring the impact of parallel tool calling, adding a rationale as an argument of the tool call, using a separate tool per database collection, and tool calling with structured outputs. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of enabling LLMs to query databases with Function Calling.

At the core of these agents, an LLM must plan, execute, and respond using external tools, APIs, and custom functions. Research on tool calling has gathered momentum, but evaluation benchmarks and datasets representing the complexity of the tasks have lagged behind. In this work, we focus on one such complexity, nested sequencing, with the goal of extending existing benchmarks and evaluation. Specifically, we present NESTFUL, a benchmark to evaluate LLMs on nested sequences of API calls, i.e., sequences where the output of one API call is passed as input to a subsequent call. NESTFUL contains 1800+ nested sequences where all the function calls are executable. Experimental results on multiple models and settings show that the best-performing model on the dataset has a full sequence match accuracy of 25% and win-rate of 34% necessitating a large scope for improvement in the nested sequencing aspect of function calling. Our analysis of these results provides possible future research directions for the community, in addition to a benchmark to track progress. We have released the NESTFUL dataset under the Apache 2.0 license at https://github.com/IBM/NESTFUL.</p></details> |  |

The Array Canary appears to be an advanced form of the array shuffling techniques employed by the Emotet JavaScript downloader. In practice, a series of Array Canaries are set within a string array and if modified will cause the program to endlessly loop. In this paper, we demonstrate how an Array Canary works and discuss Autonomous Function Call Resolution (AFCR), which is a method we created to bypass Array Canaries. We also introduce Arphsy, a proof-of-concept for AFCR designed to guide Large Language Models and security researchers in the deobfuscation of "canaried" JavaScript code. We accomplish this by (i) Finding and extracting all Immediately Invoked Function Expressions from a canaried file, (ii) parsing the file's Abstract Syntax Tree for any function that does not implement imported function calls, (iii) identifying the most reassigned variable and its corresponding function body, (iv) calculating the length of the largest string array and uses it to determine the offset values within the canaried file, (v) aggregating all the previously identified functions into a single file, and (vi) appending driver code into the verified file and using it to deobfuscate the canaried file.</p></details> |  |

Mainstream methods, such as CoT/ReAct, rely on step-by-step tool invocation to interact with external environments, but they are limited in perceptual scope and lack adequate task-planning capability. To address these limitations, other studies introduce the first Search-based Decision Tree (DFSDT), which still suffers from the high computational cost. In this paper, we introduce a novel parallel tool invocation paradigm, DTA-Llama (Divide-Then-Aggregate Llama). First, we transform traditional tree-based tool search paths into Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structure, generating a high-quality parallel tool invocation dataset. The DTA-Llama is then trained on the dataset to learn to iteratively divide the current task into several parallel tool invocation sub-tasks and aggregate the invocation results to decide the next actions. Furthermore, we introduce an efficient inference framework inspired by the Process/Threads mechanism when applying the DTA-Llama to practical tasks. Experimental results show that our approach substantially enhances task performance while reducing token consumption and inference time. Llama2-7B, using our method, is comparable to the official parallel function calling method of GPT-3.5.

Current approaches to enable tool usage often rely on model-specific prompting or fine-tuning a model for function-calling instructions. Both approaches have notable limitations, including reduced adaptability to unseen tools and high resource requirements. This paper introduces FREYR, a streamlined framework that modularizes the tool usage process into separate steps. Through this decomposition, we show that FREYR achieves superior performance compared to conventional tool usage methods. We evaluate FREYR on a set of real-world test cases specific for video game design and compare it against traditional tool usage as provided by the Ollama API.</p></details> | 15 pages |

We rank the optimisers with respect to metrics such as final energy achieved and function calls needed to get within a certain tolerance level, and find that the best performing optimisers are variants of gradient descent such as Momentum and ADAM (using finite difference), SPSA, CMAES, and BayesMGD. We also perform gradient analysis and observe that the step size for finite difference has a very significant impact. We also consider using simultaneous perturbation (inspired by SPSA) as a gradient subroutine: here finite difference can lead to a more precise estimate of the ground state but uses more calls, whereas simultaneous perturbation can converge quicker but may be less precise in the later stages. Finally, we also study the quantum natural gradient algorithm: we implement this method for 1-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard systems, and find that whilst it can reach a lower energy with fewer iterations, this improvement is typically lost when taking total function calls into account. Our method involves performing careful hyperparameter sweeping on 4 instances. We present a variety of analysis and figures, detailed optimiser notes, and discuss future directions.</p></details> | <details><summary>43 pa...</summary><p>43 pages, 30 figures.

However, evaluating the function calling abilities of LLMs in real-world scenarios remains under-explored due to the complexity of data collection and evaluation. In this work, we introduce ComplexFuncBench, a benchmark for complex function calling across five real-world scenarios. Compared to existing benchmarks, ComplexFuncBench encompasses multi-step and constrained function calling, which requires long-parameter filing, parameter value reasoning, and 128k long context. Additionally, we propose an automatic framework, ComplexEval, for quantitatively evaluating complex function calling tasks. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate the deficiencies of state-of-the-art LLMs in function calling and suggest future directions for optimizing these capabilities.

| **[A General Framework for Inference-time Scaling and Steering of Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06848v3)** | 2025-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models produce impressive results in modalities ranging from images and video to protein design and text. However, generating samples with user-specified properties remains a challenge. Recent research proposes fine-tuning models to maximize rewards that capture desired properties, but these methods require expensive training and are prone to mode collapse. In this work, we propose Feynman Kac (FK) steering, an inference-time framework for steering diffusion models with reward functions. FK steering works by sampling a system of multiple interacting diffusion processes, called particles, and resampling particles at intermediate steps based on scores computed using functions called potentials. Potentials are defined using rewards for intermediate states and are selected such that a high value indicates that the particle will yield a high-reward sample. We explore various choices of potentials, intermediate rewards, and samplers. We evaluate FK steering on text-to-image and text diffusion models. For steering text-to-image models with a human preference reward, we find that FK steering a 0.8B parameter model outperforms a 2.6B parameter fine-tuned model on prompt fidelity, with faster sampling and no training. For steering text diffusion models with rewards for text quality and specific text attributes, we find that FK steering generates lower perplexity, more linguistically acceptable outputs and enables gradient-free control of attributes like toxicity. Our results demonstrate that inference-time scaling and steering of diffusion models, even with off-the-shelf rewards, can provide significant sample quality gains and controllability benefits.

These models are usually developed by optimization experts but are used by practitioners without optimization expertise in various application domains. As a result, practitioners often struggle to interact with and draw useful conclusions from optimization models independently. To fill this gap, we introduce OptiChat, a natural language dialogue system designed to help practitioners interpret model formulation, diagnose infeasibility, analyze sensitivity, retrieve information, evaluate modifications, and provide counterfactual explanations. By augmenting large language models (LLMs) with functional calls and code generation tailored for optimization models, we enable seamless interaction and minimize the risk of hallucinations in OptiChat. We develop a new dataset to evaluate OptiChat's performance in explaining optimization models. Experiments demonstrate that OptiChat effectively bridges the gap between optimization models and practitioners, delivering autonomous, accurate, and instant responses.</p></details> |  |
| **[Data-driven system identification using quadratic embeddings of nonlinear dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08202v1)** | 2025-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel data-driven method called QENDy (Quadratic Embedding of Nonlinear Dynamics) that not only allows us to learn quadratic representations of highly nonlinear dynamical systems, but also to identify the governing equations. The approach is based on an embedding of the system into a higher-dimensional feature space in which the dynamics become quadratic. Just like SINDy (Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics), our method requires trajectory data, time derivatives for the training data points, which can also be estimated using finite difference approximations, and a set of preselected basis functions, called dictionary. We illustrate the efficacy and accuracy of QENDy with the aid of various benchmark problems and compare its performance with SINDy and a deep learning method for identifying quadratic embeddings. Furthermore, we analyze the convergence of QENDy and SINDy in the infinite data limit, highlight their similarities and main differences, and compare the quadratic embedding with linearization techniques based on the Koopman operator.</p></details> |  |

API calling in chatbot systems poses significant challenges, particularly in complex, multi-step tasks requiring accurate API selection and execution. We contribute to this domain in three ways: first, by introducing a novel dataset designed to assess models on API function selection, parameter generation, and nested API calls; second, by benchmarking state-of-the-art language models across varying levels of complexity to evaluate their performance in API function generation and parameter accuracy; and third, by proposing an enhanced API routing method that combines general-purpose large language models for API selection with fine-tuned models for parameter generation and some prompt engineering approach. These approaches lead to substantial improvements in handling complex API tasks, offering practical advancements for real-world API-driven chatbot systems.</p></details> |  |

However, progress has been hindered by a lack of reliable evaluation datasets. To address this, we present ToolHop, a dataset comprising 995 user queries and 3,912 associated tools, specifically designed for rigorous evaluation of multi-hop tool use. ToolHop ensures diverse queries, meaningful interdependencies, locally executable tools, detailed feedback, and verifiable answers through a novel query-driven data construction approach that includes tool creation, document refinement, and code generation. We evaluate 14 LLMs across five model families (i.e., LLaMA3.1, Qwen2.5, Gemini1.5, Claude3.5, and GPT), uncovering significant challenges in handling multi-hop tool-use scenarios. The leading model, GPT-4o, achieves an accuracy of 49.04%, underscoring substantial room for improvement. Further analysis reveals variations in tool-use strategies for various families, offering actionable insights to guide the development of more effective approaches.

| **[Optimizing Small Language Models for In-Vehicle Function-Calling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02342v1)** | 2025-01-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a holistic approach for deploying Small Language Models (SLMs) as function-calling agents within vehicles as edge devices, offering a more flexible and robust alternative to traditional rule-based systems. By leveraging SLMs, we simplify vehicle control mechanisms and enhance the user experience. Given the in-vehicle hardware constraints, we apply state-of-the-art model compression techniques, including structured pruning, healing, and quantization, ensuring that the model fits within the resource limitations while maintaining acceptable performance. Our work focuses on optimizing a representative SLM, Microsoft's Phi-3 mini, and outlines best practices for enabling embedded models, including compression, task-specific fine-tuning, and vehicle integration. We demonstrate that, despite significant reduction in model size which removes up to 2 billion parameters from the original model, our approach preserves the model's ability to handle complex in-vehicle tasks accurately and efficiently. Furthermore, by executing the model in a lightweight runtime environment, we achieve a generation speed of 11 tokens per second, making real-time, on-device inference feasible without hardware acceleration. Our results demonstrate the potential of SLMs to transform vehicle control systems, enabling more intuitive interactions between users and their vehicles for an enhanced driving experience.</p></details> |  |
| **[SR-Reward: Taking The Path More Traveled](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02330v1)** | 2025-01-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose a novel method for learning reward functions directly from offline demonstrations. Unlike traditional inverse reinforcement learning (IRL), our approach decouples the reward function from the learner's policy, eliminating the adversarial interaction typically required between the two. This results in a more stable and efficient training process. Our reward function, called \textit{SR-Reward}, leverages successor representation (SR) to encode a state based on expected future states' visitation under the demonstration policy and transition dynamics. By utilizing the Bellman equation, SR-Reward can be learned concurrently with most reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms without altering the existing training pipeline. We also introduce a negative sampling strategy to mitigate overestimation errors by reducing rewards for out-of-distribution data, thereby enhancing robustness. This strategy inherently introduces a conservative bias into RL algorithms that employ the learned reward. We evaluate our method on the D4RL benchmark, achieving competitive results compared to offline RL algorithms with access to true rewards and imitation learning (IL) techniques like behavioral cloning. Moreover, our ablation studies on data size and quality reveal the advantages and limitations of SR-Reward as a proxy for true rewards.</p></details> |  |

To tackle these challenges, this paper introduces ADC, an innovative approach that enhances LLMs' ability to follow function formats and match complex parameters. ADC utilizes a high-quality code fine-tuning dataset with line-level execution feedback, providing granular process supervision that fosters strong logical reasoning and adherence to function formats. It also employs an adversarial dataset generation process to improve parameter matching. The staged training methodology capitalizes on both enriched code datasets and refined adversarial datasets, leading to marked improvements in function calling capabilities on the Berkeley Function-Calling Leaderboard (BFCL) Benchmark. The innovation of ADC lies in its strategic combination of process supervision, adversarial refinement, and incremental learning, setting a new standard for LLM proficiency in complex function calling.</p></details> |  |
| **[PrettiSmart: Visual Interpretation of Smart Contracts via Simulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18484v1)** | 2024-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Smart contracts are the fundamental components of blockchain technology. They are programs to determine cryptocurrency transactions, and are irreversible once deployed, making it crucial for cryptocurrency investors to understand the cryptocurrency transaction behaviors of smart contracts comprehensively. However, it is a challenging (if not impossible) task for investors, as they do not necessarily have a programming background to check the complex source code. Even for investors with certain programming skills, inferring all the potential behaviors from the code alone is still difficult, since the actual behaviors can be different when different investors are involved. To address this challenge, we propose PrettiSmart, a novel visualization approach via execution simulation to achieve intuitive and reliable visual interpretation of smart contracts. Specifically, we develop a simulator to comprehensively capture most of the possible real-world smart contract behaviors, involving multiple investors and various smart contract functions. Then, we present PrettiSmart to intuitively visualize the simulation results of a smart contract, which consists of two modules: The Simulation Overview Module is a barcode-based design, providing a visual summary for each simulation, and the Simulation Detail Module is an augmented sequential design to display the cryptocurrency transaction details in each simulation, such as function call sequences, cryptocurrency flows, and state variable changes. It can allow investors to intuitively inspect and understand how a smart contract will work. We evaluate PrettiSmart through two case studies and in-depth user interviews with 12 investors. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and usability of PrettiSmart in facilitating an easy interpretation of smart contracts.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Dark Side of Function Calling: Pathways to Jailbreaking Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17915v4)** | 2024-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, but their power comes with significant security considerations. While extensive research has been conducted on the safety of LLMs in chat mode, the security implications of their function calling feature have been largely overlooked. This paper uncovers a critical vulnerability in the function calling process of LLMs, introducing a novel "jailbreak function" attack method that exploits alignment discrepancies, user coercion, and the absence of rigorous safety filters. Our empirical study, conducted on six state-of-the-art LLMs including GPT-4o, Claude-3.5-Sonnet, and Gemini-1.5-pro, reveals an alarming average success rate of over 90\% for this attack. We provide a comprehensive analysis of why function calls are susceptible to such attacks and propose defensive strategies, including the use of defensive prompts. Our findings highlight the urgent need for enhanced security measures in the function calling capabilities of LLMs, contributing to the field of AI safety by identifying a previously unexplored risk, designing an effective attack method, and suggesting practical defensive measures.

Further improving the performance and robustness of community detection has attracted significant attention. This paper considers edge noise, which causes edges in the network to be added or removed. Existing methods achieve graph denoising through link prediction or robustness in low eigenvectors. However, they are either limited in application scenarios or not determined for effectiveness. We find that the noisy pixel in the adjacency matrix has a certain proportion in the loss function, which makes the optimization of the community detection model seriously deviate from the correct direction. Thus, we design an flexible framework to silence the contribution of noisy pixels to loss function, called Silencer. We take the nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) and deep NMF methods as examples since they are the prime models for community detection. We first prove the convergence of Silencer in NMF. Compared with existing methods, Silencer show top performance in six real-world networks with random noise, adversarial perturbation, and mixed noise. Moreover, Silencer works on random (ER), scale-free (BA), and small-world (WS) networks, and the improvement of Silencer is gradually insignificant in the order ER, BA, and WS networks.</p></details> |  |

By leveraging these APIs as functional tools, enterprises can design diverse, scenario-specific agent applications, driven by on-premise function-calling models as the core engine. However, generic models often fail to meet enterprise requirements in terms of computational efficiency, output accuracy, and stability, necessitating scenario-specific adaptation. In this paper, we propose a training pipeline for function-calling capabilities tailored to real-world business scenarios. This pipeline includes the synthesis and augmentation of scenario-specific function-calling data, model fine-tuning, and performance evaluation and analysis. Using this pipeline, we generated 1,260 fully AI-generated samples and 1,035 augmented manually-labeled samples in digital HR agent scenario. The Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct model was employed as the base model and fine-tuned using the LoRA method on four GPUs with 24GB VRAM. Our fine-tuned model demonstrated outstanding performance in evaluations and practical applications, surpassing GPT-4 and GPT-4o in accuracy on the test set. These results validate the reliability of the proposed pipeline for training scenario-specific function-calling models.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 6 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

In this case, developers rely on stack traces, i.e., series of function calls that led to the error. Since there can be tens and hundreds of thousands of them describing the same issue from different users, automatic deduplication into categories is necessary to allow for processing. Recent works have proposed powerful deep learning-based approaches for this, but they are evaluated and compared in isolation from real-life workflows, and it is not clear whether they will actually work well at scale. To overcome this gap, this work presents three main contributions: a novel model, an industry-based dataset, and a multi-faceted evaluation. Our model consists of two parts - (1) an embedding model with byte-pair encoding and approximate nearest neighbor search to quickly find the most relevant stack traces to the incoming one, and (2) a reranker that re-ranks the most fitting stack traces, taking into account the repeated frames between them. To complement the existing datasets collected from open-source projects, we share with the community SlowOps - a dataset of stack traces from IntelliJ-based products developed by JetBrains, which has an order of magnitude more stack traces per category. Finally, we carry out an evaluation that strives to be realistic: measuring not only the accuracy of categorization, but also the operation time and the ability to create new categories. The evaluation shows that our model strikes a good balance - it outperforms other models on both open-source datasets and SlowOps, while also being faster on time than most. We release all of our code and data, and hope that our work can pave the way to further practice-oriented research in the area.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at SANER'25. 11 pages, 2 figures</p></details> |
| **[Unlock the Correlation between Supervised Fine-Tuning and Reinforcement Learning in Training Code Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10305v2)** | 2024-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatic code generation has been a longstanding research topic. With the advancement of general-purpose large language models (LLMs), the ability to code stands out as one important measure to the model's reasoning performance. Usually, a two-stage training paradigm is implemented to obtain a Code LLM, namely the pretraining and the fine-tuning. Within the fine-tuning, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and reinforcement learning (RL) are often used to improve the model's zero-shot ability. A large number of work has been conducted to improve the model's performance on code-related benchmarks with either modifications to the algorithm or refinement of the dataset. However, we still lack a deep insight into the correlation between SFT and RL. For instance, what kind of dataset should be used to ensure generalization, or what if we abandon the SFT phase in fine-tuning. In this work, we make an attempt to understand the correlation between SFT and RL. To facilitate our research, we manually craft 100 basis python functions, called atomic functions, and then a synthesizing pipeline is deployed to create a large number of synthetic functions on top of the atomic ones. In this manner, we ensure that the train and test sets remain distinct, preventing data contamination. Through comprehensive ablation study, we find: (1) Both atomic and synthetic functions are indispensable for SFT's generalization, and only a handful of synthetic functions are adequate; (2) Through RL, the SFT's generalization to target domain can be greatly enhanced, even with the same training prompts; (3) Training RL from scratch can alleviate the over-fitting issue introduced in the SFT phase.</p></details> |  |

The PIs obtained by minimizing the empirical risk based on the Tube Loss are shown to be of better quality than the PIs obtained by the existing methods in the following sense. First, it yields intervals that attain the prespecified confidence level $t \in(0,1)$ asymptotically. A theoretical proof of this fact is given. Secondly, the user is allowed to move the interval up or down by controlling the value of a parameter. This helps the user to choose a PI capturing denser regions of the probability distribution of the response variable inside the interval, and thus, sharpening its width. This is shown to be especially useful when the conditional distribution of the response variable is skewed. Further, the Tube Loss based PI estimation method can trade-off between the coverage and the average width by solving a single optimization problem. It enables further reduction of the average width of PI through re-calibration. Also, unlike a few existing PI estimation methods the gradient descent (GD) method can be used for minimization of empirical risk. Finally, through extensive experimentation, we have shown the efficacy of the Tube Loss based PI estimation in kernel machines, neural networks and deep networks and also for probabilistic forecasting tasks. The codes of the experiments are available at https://github.com/ltpritamanand/Tube_loss</p></details> |  |

However, the process can be protracted and resource-intensive, especially when confronted with extensive codebases. In this work, I present FuzzDistill, an approach that harnesses compile-time data and machine learning to refine fuzzing targets. By analyzing compile-time information, such as function call graphs' features, loop information, and memory operations, FuzzDistill identifies high-priority areas of the codebase that are more probable to contain vulnerabilities. I demonstrate the efficacy of my approach through experiments conducted on real-world software, demonstrating substantial reductions in testing time.</p></details> |  |

In real-world scenarios, user questions often require retrieving answers that are distributed across multiple tables. GraphRAG has recently attracted much attention for enhancing LLMs' reasoning capabilities by organizing external knowledge to address ad-hoc and complex questions, exemplifying a promising direction for cross-table question answering. In this paper, to address the current gap in available data, we first introduce a multi-table benchmark, MutliTableQA, comprising 60k tables and 25k user queries collected from real-world sources. Then, we propose the first Graph-Table-RAG framework, namely GTR, which reorganizes table corpora into a heterogeneous graph, employs a hierarchical coarse-to-fine retrieval process to extract the most relevant tables, and integrates graph-aware prompting for downstream LLMs' tabular reasoning. Extensive experiments show that GTR exhibits superior cross-table question-answering performance while maintaining high deployment efficiency, demonstrating its real-world practical applicability.</p></details> | 20 pages, 7 figures |

However, despite with intrinsic world knowledge, their application on structured tabular data prediction still lags behind, primarily due to the numerical insensitivity and modality discrepancy that brings a gap between LLM reasoning and statistical tabular learning. Unlike textual or vision data (e.g., electronic clinical notes or medical imaging data), tabular data is often presented in heterogeneous numerical values (e.g., CBC reports). This ubiquitous data format requires intensive expert annotation, and its numerical nature limits LLMs' capability to effectively transfer untapped domain expertise. In this paper, we propose SERSAL, a general self-prompting method by synergy learning with small models to enhance LLM tabular prediction in an unsupervised manner. Specifically, SERSAL utilizes the LLM's prior outcomes as original soft noisy annotations, which are dynamically leveraged to teach a better small student model. Reversely, the outcomes from the trained small model are used to teach the LLM to further refine its real capability. This process can be repeatedly applied to gradually distill refined knowledge for continuous progress. Comprehensive experiments on widely used medical domain tabular datasets show that, without access to gold labels, applying SERSAL to OpenAI GPT reasoning process attains substantial improvement compared to linguistic prompting methods, which serves as an orthogonal direction for tabular LLM, and increasing prompting bonus is observed as more powerful LLMs appear.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025.

In this work, we address this concern for tabular data. Specifically, we introduce a variety of different techniques to assess whether a language model has seen a tabular dataset during training. This investigation reveals that LLMs have memorized many popular tabular datasets verbatim. We then compare the few-shot learning performance of LLMs on datasets that were seen during training to the performance on datasets released after training. We find that LLMs perform better on datasets seen during training, indicating that memorization leads to overfitting. At the same time, LLMs show non-trivial performance on novel datasets and are surprisingly robust to data transformations. We then investigate the in-context statistical learning abilities of LLMs. While LLMs are significantly better than random at solving statistical classification problems, the sample efficiency of few-shot learning lags behind traditional statistical learning algorithms, especially as the dimension of the problem increases. This suggests that much of the observed few-shot performance on novel real-world datasets is due to the LLM's world knowledge. Overall, our results highlight the importance of testing whether an LLM has seen an evaluation dataset during pre-training. We release the https://github.com/interpretml/LLM-Tabular-Memorization-Checker Python package to test LLMs for memorization of tabular datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>COLM ...</summary><p>COLM camera ready, fix typo</p></details> |

Since it is impossible to generalize to a completely new and unknown domain, we study models that are easy to adapt to the target domain even with few labeled examples. We focus on building more informative representations of tabular data that can mitigate $Y|X$-shifts, and propose to leverage the prior world knowledge in LLMs by serializing (write down) the tabular data to encode it. We find LLM embeddings alone provide inconsistent improvements in robustness, but models trained on them can be well adapted/finetuned to the target domain even using 32 labeled observations. Our finding is based on a comprehensive and systematic study consisting of 7650 source-target pairs and benchmark against 261,000 model configurations trained by 22 algorithms. Our observation holds when ablating the size of accessible target data and different adaptation strategies. The code is available at https://github.com/namkoong-lab/LLM-Tabular-Shifts.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we address this concern for tabular data. Starting with simple qualitative tests for whether an LLM knows the names and values of features, we introduce a variety of different techniques to assess the degrees of contamination, including statistical tests for conditional distribution modeling and four tests that identify memorization. Our investigation reveals that LLMs are pre-trained on many popular tabular datasets. This exposure can lead to invalid performance evaluation on downstream tasks because the LLMs have, in effect, been fit to the test set. Interestingly, we also identify a regime where the language model reproduces important statistics of the data, but fails to reproduce the dataset verbatim. On these datasets, although seen during training, good performance on downstream tasks might not be due to overfitting. Our findings underscore the need for ensuring data integrity in machine learning tasks with LLMs. To facilitate future research, we release an open-source tool that can perform various tests for memorization \url{https://github.com/interpretml/LLM-Tabular-Memorization-Checker}.</p></details> | <details><summary>Table...</summary><p>Table Representation Learning Workshop at NeurIPS 2023</p></details> |
