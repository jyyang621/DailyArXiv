| **[A RAG-based Question Answering System Proposal for Understanding Islam: MufassirQAS LLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15378v5)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Challenges exist in learning and understanding religions, such as the complexity and depth of religious doctrines and teachings. Chatbots as question-answering systems can help in solving these challenges. LLM chatbots use NLP techniques to establish connections between topics and accurately respond to complex questions. These capabilities make it perfect for enlightenment on religion as a question-answering chatbot. However, LLMs also tend to generate false information, known as hallucination. Also, the chatbots' responses can include content that insults personal religious beliefs, interfaith conflicts, and controversial or sensitive topics. It must avoid such cases without promoting hate speech or offending certain groups of people or their beliefs. This study uses a vector database-based Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approach to enhance the accuracy and transparency of LLMs. Our question-answering system is called "MufassirQAS". We created a database consisting of several open-access books that include Turkish context. These books contain Turkish translations and interpretations of Islam. This database is utilized to answer religion-related questions and ensure our answers are trustworthy. The relevant part of the dataset, which LLM also uses, is presented along with the answer. We have put careful effort into creating system prompts that give instructions to prevent harmful, offensive, or disrespectful responses to respect people's values and provide reliable results. The system answers and shares additional information, such as the page number from the respective book and the articles referenced for obtaining the information. MufassirQAS and ChatGPT are also tested with sensitive questions. We got better performance with our system. Study and enhancements are still in progress. Results and future works are given.</p></details> |  |
| **[SOSecure: Safer Code Generation with RAG and StackOverflow Discussions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13654v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used for automated code generation. Their reliance on infrequently updated pretraining data leaves them unaware of newly discovered vulnerabilities and evolving security standards, making them prone to producing insecure code. In contrast, developer communities on Stack Overflow (SO) provide an ever-evolving repository of knowledge, where security vulnerabilities are actively discussed and addressed through collective expertise. These community-driven insights remain largely untapped by LLMs. This paper introduces SOSecure, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that leverages the collective security expertise found in SO discussions to improve the security of LLM-generated code. We build a security-focused knowledge base by extracting SO answers and comments that explicitly identify vulnerabilities. Unlike common uses of RAG, SOSecure triggers after code has been generated to find discussions that identify flaws in similar code. These are used in a prompt to an LLM to consider revising the code. Evaluation across three datasets (SALLM, LLMSecEval, and LMSys) show that SOSecure achieves strong fix rates of 71.7%, 91.3%, and 96.7% respectively, compared to prompting GPT-4 without relevant discussions (49.1%, 56.5%, and 37.5%), and outperforms multiple other baselines. SOSecure operates as a language-agnostic complement to existing LLMs, without requiring retraining or fine-tuning, making it easy to deploy. Our results underscore the importance of maintaining active developer forums, which have dropped substantially in usage with LLM adoptions.</p></details> |  |
| **[MES-RAG: Bringing Multi-modal, Entity-Storage, and Secure Enhancements to RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13563v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) improves Large Language Models (LLMs) by using external knowledge, but it struggles with precise entity information retrieval. In this paper, we proposed MES-RAG framework, which enhances entity-specific query handling and provides accurate, secure, and consistent responses. MES-RAG introduces proactive security measures that ensure system integrity by applying protections prior to data access. Additionally, the system supports real-time multi-modal outputs, including text, images, audio, and video, seamlessly integrating into existing RAG architectures. Experimental results demonstrate that MES-RAG significantly improves both accuracy and recall, highlighting its effectiveness in advancing the security and utility of question-answering, increasing accuracy to 0.83 (+0.25) on targeted task. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/wpydcr/MES-RAG.</p></details> | NAACL 2025 |
| **[RAG-KG-IL: A Multi-Agent Hybrid Framework for Reducing Hallucinations and Enhancing LLM Reasoning through RAG and Incremental Knowledge Graph Learning Integration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13514v1)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents RAG-KG-IL, a novel multi-agent hybrid framework designed to enhance the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Knowledge Graphs (KGs) with an Incremental Learning (IL) approach. Despite recent advancements, LLMs still face significant challenges in reasoning with structured data, handling dynamic knowledge evolution, and mitigating hallucinations, particularly in mission-critical domains. Our proposed RAG-KG-IL framework addresses these limitations by employing a multi-agent architecture that enables continuous knowledge updates, integrates structured knowledge, and incorporates autonomous agents for enhanced explainability and reasoning. The framework utilizes RAG to ensure the generated responses are grounded in verifiable information, while KGs provide structured domain knowledge for improved consistency and depth of understanding. The Incremental Learning approach allows for dynamic updates to the knowledge base without full retraining, significantly reducing computational overhead and improving the model's adaptability. We evaluate the framework using real-world case studies involving health-related queries, comparing it to state-of-the-art models like GPT-4o and a RAG-only baseline. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces hallucination rates and improves answer completeness and reasoning accuracy. The results underscore the potential of combining RAG, KGs, and multi-agent systems to create intelligent, adaptable systems capable of real-time knowledge integration and reasoning in complex domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Taxonomic Reasoning for Rare Arthropods: Combining Dense Image Captioning and RAG for Interpretable Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10886v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the context of pressing climate change challenges and the significant biodiversity loss among arthropods, automated taxonomic classification from organismal images is a subject of intense research. However, traditional AI pipelines based on deep neural visual architectures such as CNNs or ViTs face limitations such as degraded performance on the long-tail of classes and the inability to reason about their predictions. We integrate image captioning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with large language models (LLMs) to enhance biodiversity monitoring, showing particular promise for characterizing rare and unknown arthropod species. While a naive Vision-Language Model (VLM) excels in classifying images of common species, the RAG model enables classification of rarer taxa by matching explicit textual descriptions of taxonomic features to contextual biodiversity text data from external sources. The RAG model shows promise in reducing overconfidence and enhancing accuracy relative to naive LLMs, suggesting its viability in capturing the nuances of taxonomic hierarchy, particularly at the challenging family and genus levels. Our findings highlight the potential for modern vision-language AI pipelines to support biodiversity conservation initiatives, emphasizing the role of comprehensive data curation and collaboration with citizen science platforms to improve species identification, unknown species characterization and ultimately inform conservation strategies.</p></details> | 12 pages, 3 figures |
| **[ClaimTrust: Propagation Trust Scoring for RAG Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10702v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid adoption of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems has revolutionized large-scale content generation but has also highlighted the challenge of ensuring trustworthiness in retrieved information. This paper introduces ClaimTrust, a propagation-based trust scoring framework that dynamically evaluates the reliability of documents in a RAG system. Using a modified PageRank-inspired algorithm, ClaimTrust propagates trust scores across documents based on relationships derived from extracted factual claims. We preprocess and analyze 814 political news articles from Kaggle's Fake News Detection Dataset to extract 2,173 unique claims and classify 965 meaningful relationships (supporting or contradicting). By representing the dataset as a document graph, ClaimTrust iteratively updates trust scores until convergence, effectively differentiating trustworthy articles from unreliable ones. Our methodology, which leverages embedding-based filtering for efficient claim comparison and relationship classification, achieves a 11.2% of significant connections while maintaining computational scalability. Experimental results demonstrate that ClaimTrust successfully assigns higher trust scores to verified documents while penalizing those containing false information. Future directions include fine-tuned claim extract and compare (Li et al., 2022), parameter optimization, enhanced language model utilization, and robust evaluation metrics to generalize the framework across diverse datasets and domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 2 figures, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[Balancing Content Size in RAG-Text2SQL System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15723v2)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising solution for converting natural language queries into SQL commands, enabling seamless database interaction. However, these Text-to-SQL (Text2SQL) systems face inherent limitations, hallucinations, outdated knowledge, and untraceable reasoning. To address these challenges, the integration of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with Text2SQL models has gained traction. RAG serves as a retrieval mechanism, providing essential contextual information, such as table schemas and metadata, to enhance the query generation process. Despite their potential, RAG + Text2SQL systems are susceptible to the quality and size of retrieved documents. While richer document content can improve schema relevance and retrieval accuracy, it also introduces noise, increasing the risk of hallucinations and reducing query fidelity as the prompt size of the Text2SQL model increases. This research investigates the nuanced trade-off between document size and quality, aiming to strike a balance that optimizes system performance. Key thresholds are identified where performance degradation occurs, along with actionable strategies to mitigate these challenges. Additionally, we explore the phenomenon of hallucinations in Text2SQL models, emphasizing the critical role of curated document presentation in minimizing errors. Our findings provide a roadmap for enhancing the robustness of RAG + Text2SQL systems, offering practical insights for real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[RAG-Adapter: A Plug-and-Play RAG-enhanced Framework for Long Video Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08576v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) capable of video understanding are advancing rapidly. To effectively assess their video comprehension capabilities, long video understanding benchmarks, such as Video-MME and MLVU, are proposed. However, these benchmarks directly use uniform frame sampling for testing, which results in significant information loss and affects the accuracy of the evaluations in reflecting the true abilities of MLLMs. To address this, we propose RAG-Adapter, a plug-and-play framework that reduces information loss during testing by sampling frames most relevant to the given question. Additionally, we introduce a Grouped-supervised Contrastive Learning (GCL) method to further enhance sampling effectiveness of RAG-Adapter through fine-tuning on our constructed MMAT dataset. Finally, we test numerous baseline MLLMs on various video understanding benchmarks, finding that RAG-Adapter sampling consistently outperforms uniform sampling (e.g., Accuracy of GPT-4o increases by 9.3 percent on Video-MME), providing a more accurate testing method for long video benchmarks.</p></details> | 37 pages, 36 figures |
| **[RAAD-LLM: Adaptive Anomaly Detection Using LLMs and RAG Integration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02800v3)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection in complex industrial environments poses unique challenges, particularly in contexts characterized by data sparsity and evolving operational conditions. Predictive maintenance (PdM) in such settings demands methodologies that are adaptive, transferable, and capable of integrating domain-specific knowledge. In this paper, we present RAAD-LLM, a novel framework for adaptive anomaly detection, leveraging large language models (LLMs) integrated with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). This approach addresses the aforementioned PdM challenges. By effectively utilizing domain-specific knowledge, RAAD-LLM enhances the detection of anomalies in time series data without requiring fine-tuning on specific datasets. The framework's adaptability mechanism enables it to adjust its understanding of normal operating conditions dynamically, thus increasing detection accuracy. We validate this methodology through a real-world application for a plastics manufacturing plant and the Skoltech Anomaly Benchmark (SKAB). Results show significant improvements over our previous model with an accuracy increase from 70.7% to 88.6% on the real-world dataset. By allowing for the enriching of input series data with semantics, RAAD-LLM incorporates multimodal capabilities that facilitate more collaborative decision-making between the model and plant operators. Overall, our findings support RAAD-LLM's ability to revolutionize anomaly detection methodologies in PdM, potentially leading to a paradigm shift in how anomaly detection is implemented across various industries.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2411.00914</p></details> |
| **[OpenRAG: Optimizing RAG End-to-End via In-Context Retrieval Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08398v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we analyze and empirically show that the learned relevance for conventional information retrieval (IR) scenarios may be inconsistent in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce OpenRAG, a RAG framework that is optimized end-to-end by tuning the retriever to capture in-context relevance, enabling adaptation to the diverse and evolving needs. Extensive experiments across a wide range of tasks demonstrate that OpenRAG, by tuning a retriever end-to-end, leads to a consistent improvement of 4.0% over the original retriever, consistently outperforming existing state-of-the-art retrievers by 2.1%. Additionally, our results indicate that for some tasks, an end-to-end tuned 0.2B retriever can achieve improvements that surpass those of RAG-oriented or instruction-tuned 8B large language models (LLMs), highlighting the cost-effectiveness of our approach in enhancing RAG systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[OCR Hinders RAG: Evaluating the Cascading Impact of OCR on Retrieval-Augmented Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02592v2)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating external knowledge to reduce hallucinations and incorporate up-to-date information without retraining. As an essential part of RAG, external knowledge bases are commonly built by extracting structured data from unstructured PDF documents using Optical Character Recognition (OCR). However, given the imperfect prediction of OCR and the inherent non-uniform representation of structured data, knowledge bases inevitably contain various OCR noises. In this paper, we introduce OHRBench, the first benchmark for understanding the cascading impact of OCR on RAG systems. OHRBench includes 8,561 carefully selected unstructured document images from seven real-world RAG application domains, along with 8,498 Q&A pairs derived from multimodal elements in documents, challenging existing OCR solutions used for RAG. To better understand OCR's impact on RAG systems, we identify two primary types of OCR noise: Semantic Noise and Formatting Noise and apply perturbation to generate a set of structured data with varying degrees of each OCR noise. Using OHRBench, we first conduct a comprehensive evaluation of current OCR solutions and reveal that none is competent for constructing high-quality knowledge bases for RAG systems. We then systematically evaluate the impact of these two noise types and demonstrate the trend relationship between the degree of OCR noise and RAG performance. Our OHRBench, including PDF documents, Q&As, and the ground truth structured data are released at: https://github.com/opendatalab/OHR-Bench</p></details> | Work in progress |
| **[Machine Against the RAG: Jamming Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Blocker Documents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05870v4)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems respond to queries by retrieving relevant documents from a knowledge database and applying an LLM to the retrieved documents. We demonstrate that RAG systems that operate on databases with untrusted content are vulnerable to denial-of-service attacks we call jamming. An adversary can add a single ``blocker'' document to the database that will be retrieved in response to a specific query and result in the RAG system not answering this query, ostensibly because it lacks relevant information or because the answer is unsafe. We describe and measure the efficacy of several methods for generating blocker documents, including a new method based on black-box optimization. Our method (1) does not rely on instruction injection, (2) does not require the adversary to know the embedding or LLM used by the target RAG system, and (3) does not employ an auxiliary LLM. We evaluate jamming attacks on several embeddings and LLMs and demonstrate that the existing safety metrics for LLMs do not capture their vulnerability to jamming. We then discuss defenses against blocker documents.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in USENIX Security Symposium 2025</p></details> |
| **[RAG-Enhanced Collaborative LLM Agents for Drug Discovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17506v2)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential to accelerate drug discovery. However, the specialized nature of biochemical data often necessitates costly domain-specific fine-tuning, posing critical challenges. First, it hinders the application of more flexible general-purpose LLMs in cutting-edge drug discovery tasks. More importantly, it impedes the rapid integration of the vast amounts of scientific data continuously generated through experiments and research. To investigate these challenges, we propose CLADD, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-empowered agentic system tailored to drug discovery tasks. Through the collaboration of multiple LLM agents, CLADD dynamically retrieves information from biomedical knowledge bases, contextualizes query molecules, and integrates relevant evidence to generate responses -- all without the need for domain-specific fine-tuning. Crucially, we tackle key obstacles in applying RAG workflows to biochemical data, including data heterogeneity, ambiguity, and multi-source integration. We demonstrate the flexibility and effectiveness of this framework across a variety of drug discovery tasks, showing that it outperforms general-purpose and domain-specific LLMs as well as traditional deep learning approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Machi...</summary><p>Machine Learning, Drug Discovery</p></details> |
| **[SmartRAG: Jointly Learn RAG-Related Tasks From the Environment Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18141v2)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>RAG systems consist of multiple modules to work together. However, these modules are usually separately trained. We argue that a system like RAG that incorporates multiple modules should be jointly optimized to achieve optimal performance. To demonstrate this, we design a specific pipeline called \textbf{SmartRAG} that includes a policy network and a retriever. The policy network can serve as 1) a decision maker that decides when to retrieve, 2) a query rewriter to generate a query most suited to the retriever, and 3) an answer generator that produces the final response with/without the observations. We then propose to jointly optimize the whole system using a reinforcement learning algorithm, with the reward designed to encourage the system to achieve the best performance with minimal retrieval cost. When jointly optimized, all the modules can be aware of how other modules are working and thus find the best way to work together as a complete system. Empirical results demonstrate that the jointly optimized SmartRAG can achieve better performance than separately optimized counterparts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Human Cognition Inspired RAG with Knowledge Graph for Complex Problem Solving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06567v1)** | 2025-03-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated transformative potential across various domains, yet they face significant challenges in knowledge integration and complex problem reasoning, often leading to hallucinations and unreliable outputs. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising solution to enhance LLMs accuracy by incorporating external knowledge. However, traditional RAG systems struggle with processing complex relational information and multi-step reasoning, limiting their effectiveness in advanced problem-solving tasks. To address these limitations, we propose CogGRAG, a cognition inspired graph-based RAG framework, designed to improve LLMs performance in Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA). Inspired by the human cognitive process of decomposing complex problems and performing self-verification, our framework introduces a three-stage methodology: decomposition, retrieval, and reasoning with self-verification. By integrating these components, CogGRAG enhances the accuracy of LLMs in complex problem solving. We conduct systematic experiments with three LLM backbones on four benchmark datasets, where CogGRAG outperforms the baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[MM-PoisonRAG: Disrupting Multimodal RAG with Local and Global Poisoning Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17832v2)** | 2025-03-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) equipped with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) leverage both their rich parametric knowledge and the dynamic, external knowledge to excel in tasks such as Question Answering. While RAG enhances MLLMs by grounding responses in query-relevant external knowledge, this reliance poses a critical yet underexplored safety risk: knowledge poisoning attacks, where misinformation or irrelevant knowledge is intentionally injected into external knowledge bases to manipulate model outputs to be incorrect and even harmful. To expose such vulnerabilities in multimodal RAG, we propose MM-PoisonRAG, a novel knowledge poisoning attack framework with two attack strategies: Localized Poisoning Attack (LPA), which injects query-specific misinformation in both text and images for targeted manipulation, and Globalized Poisoning Attack (GPA) to provide false guidance during MLLM generation to elicit nonsensical responses across all queries. We evaluate our attacks across multiple tasks, models, and access settings, demonstrating that LPA successfully manipulates the MLLM to generate attacker-controlled answers, with a success rate of up to 56% on MultiModalQA. Moreover, GPA completely disrupts model generation to 0% accuracy with just a single irrelevant knowledge injection. Our results highlight the urgent need for robust defenses against knowledge poisoning to safeguard multimodal RAG frameworks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is available at https://github.com/HyeonjeongHa/MM-PoisonRAG</p></details> |
| **[Improving RAG Retrieval via Propositional Content Extraction: a Speech Act Theory Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10654v1)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When users formulate queries, they often include not only the information they seek, but also pragmatic markers such as interrogative phrasing or polite requests. Although these speech act indicators communicate the user\textquotesingle s intent -- whether it is asking a question, making a request, or stating a fact -- they do not necessarily add to the core informational content of the query itself. This paper investigates whether extracting the underlying propositional content from user utterances -- essentially stripping away the linguistic markers of intent -- can improve retrieval quality in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Drawing upon foundational insights from speech act theory, we propose a practical method for automatically transforming queries into their propositional equivalents before embedding. To assess the efficacy of this approach, we conducted an experimental study involving 63 user queries related to a Brazilian telecommunications news corpus with precomputed semantic embeddings. Results demonstrate clear improvements in semantic similarity between query embeddings and document embeddings at top ranks, confirming that queries stripped of speech act indicators more effectively retrieve relevant content.</p></details> | 19 pages, 4 figures |
| **[FinTMMBench: Benchmarking Temporal-Aware Multi-Modal RAG in Finance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05185v1)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Finance decision-making often relies on in-depth data analysis across various data sources, including financial tables, news articles, stock prices, etc. In this work, we introduce FinTMMBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating temporal-aware multi-modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems in finance. Built from heterologous data of NASDAQ 100 companies, FinTMMBench offers three significant advantages. 1) Multi-modal Corpus: It encompasses a hybrid of financial tables, news articles, daily stock prices, and visual technical charts as the corpus. 2) Temporal-aware Questions: Each question requires the retrieval and interpretation of its relevant data over a specific time period, including daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, and annual periods. 3) Diverse Financial Analysis Tasks: The questions involve 10 different tasks, including information extraction, trend analysis, sentiment analysis and event detection, etc. We further propose a novel TMMHybridRAG method, which first leverages LLMs to convert data from other modalities (e.g., tabular, visual and time-series data) into textual format and then incorporates temporal information in each node when constructing graphs and dense indexes. Its effectiveness has been validated in extensive experiments, but notable gaps remain, highlighting the challenges presented by our FinTMMBench.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[Beyond RAG: Task-Aware KV Cache Compression for Comprehensive Knowledge Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04973v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Incorporating external knowledge in large language models (LLMs) enhances their utility across diverse applications, but existing methods have trade-offs. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) fetches evidence via similarity search, but key information may fall outside top ranked results. Long-context models can process multiple documents but are computationally expensive and limited by context window size. Inspired by students condensing study material for open-book exams, we propose task-aware key-value (KV) cache compression, which compresses external knowledge in a zero- or few-shot setup. This enables LLMs to reason efficiently over a compacted representation of all relevant information. Experiments show our approach outperforms both RAG and task-agnostic compression methods. On LongBench v2, it improves accuracy by up to 7 absolute points over RAG with a 30x compression rate, while reducing inference latency from 0.43s to 0.16s. A synthetic dataset highlights that RAG performs well when sparse evidence suffices, whereas task-aware compression is superior for broad knowledge tasks.</p></details> |  |

Although previous studies noted that retrieving many documents can degrade performance, they did not isolate how the quantity of documents affects performance while controlling for context length. We evaluate various language models on custom datasets derived from a multi-hop QA task. We keep the context length and position of relevant information constant while varying the number of documents, and find that increasing the document count in RAG settings poses significant challenges for LLMs. Additionally, our results indicate that processing multiple documents is a separate challenge from handling long contexts. We also make the datasets and code available: https://github.com/shaharl6000/MoreDocsSameLen .</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[In-depth Analysis of Graph-based RAG in a Unified Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04338v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has proven effective in integrating external knowledge into large language models (LLMs), improving their factual accuracy, adaptability, interpretability, and trustworthiness. A number of graph-based RAG methods have been proposed in the literature. However, these methods have not been systematically and comprehensively compared under the same experimental settings. In this paper, we first summarize a unified framework to incorporate all graph-based RAG methods from a high-level perspective. We then extensively compare representative graph-based RAG methods over a range of questing-answering (QA) datasets -- from specific questions to abstract questions -- and examine the effectiveness of all methods, providing a thorough analysis of graph-based RAG approaches. As a byproduct of our experimental analysis, we are also able to identify new variants of the graph-based RAG methods over specific QA and abstract QA tasks respectively, by combining existing techniques, which outperform the state-of-the-art methods. Finally, based on these findings, we offer promising research opportunities. We believe that a deeper understanding of the behavior of existing methods can provide new valuable insights for future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[LaRA: Benchmarking Retrieval-Augmented Generation and Long-Context LLMs -- No Silver Bullet for LC or RAG Routing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09977v2)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effectively incorporating external knowledge into Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for enhancing their capabilities and addressing real-world needs. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers an effective method for achieving this by retrieving the most relevant fragments into LLMs. However, the advancements in context window size for LLMs offer an alternative approach, raising the question of whether RAG remains necessary for effectively handling external knowledge. Several existing studies provide inconclusive comparisons between RAG and long-context (LC) LLMs, largely due to limitations in the benchmark designs. In this paper, we present LaRA, a novel benchmark specifically designed to rigorously compare RAG and LC LLMs. LaRA encompasses 2326 test cases across four practical QA task categories and three types of naturally occurring long texts. Through systematic evaluation of seven open-source and four proprietary LLMs, we find that the optimal choice between RAG and LC depends on a complex interplay of factors, including the model's parameter size, long-text capabilities, context length, task type, and the characteristics of the retrieved chunks. Our findings provide actionable guidelines for practitioners to effectively leverage both RAG and LC approaches in developing and deploying LLM applications.

| **[Measuring and Enhancing Trustworthiness of LLMs in RAG through Grounded Attributions and Learning to Refuse](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11242v3)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs are an integral component of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. While many studies focus on evaluating the overall quality of end-to-end RAG systems, there is a gap in understanding the appropriateness of LLMs for the RAG task. To address this, we introduce Trust-Score, a holistic metric that evaluates the trustworthiness of LLMs within the RAG framework. Our results show that various prompting methods, such as in-context learning, fail to effectively adapt LLMs to the RAG task as measured by Trust-Score. Consequently, we propose Trust-Align, a method to align LLMs for improved Trust-Score performance. 26 out of 27 models aligned using Trust-Align substantially outperform competitive baselines on ASQA, QAMPARI, and ELI5. Specifically, in LLaMA-3-8b, Trust-Align outperforms FRONT on ASQA (up 12.56), QAMPARI (up 36.04), and ELI5 (up 17.69). Trust-Align also significantly enhances models' ability to correctly refuse and provide quality citations. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of Trust-Align across different open-weight models, including the LLaMA series (1b to 8b), Qwen-2.5 series (0.5b to 7b), and Phi3.5 (3.8b). We release our code at https://github.com/declare-lab/trust-align.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ICLR 2025 (Oral)</p></details> |
| **[RAGEval: Scenario Specific RAG Evaluation Dataset Generation Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01262v5)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a powerful approach that enables large language models (LLMs) to incorporate external knowledge. However, evaluating the effectiveness of RAG systems in specialized scenarios remains challenging due to the high costs of data construction and the lack of suitable evaluation metrics. This paper introduces RAGEval, a framework designed to assess RAG systems across diverse scenarios by generating high-quality documents, questions, answers, and references through a schema-based pipeline. With a focus on factual accuracy, we propose three novel metrics: Completeness, Hallucination, and Irrelevance to evaluate LLM generated responses rigorously. Experimental results show that RAGEval outperforms zero-shot and one-shot methods in terms of clarity, safety, conformity, and richness of generated samples. Furthermore, the use of LLMs for scoring the proposed metrics demonstrates a high level of consistency with human evaluations.

| **[SAGE: A Framework of Precise Retrieval for RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01713v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has demonstrated significant proficiency in conducting question-answering (QA) tasks within a specified corpus. Nonetheless, numerous failure instances of RAG in QA still exist. These failures are not solely attributable to the limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs); instead, they predominantly arise from the retrieval of inaccurate information for LLMs due to two limitations: (1) Current RAG methods segment the corpus without considering semantics, making it difficult to find relevant context due to impaired correlation between questions and the segments. (2) There is a trade-off between missing essential context with fewer context retrieved and getting irrelevant context with more context retrieved. In this paper, we introduce a RAG framework (SAGE), to overcome these limitations. First, to address the segmentation issue without considering semantics, we propose to train a semantic segmentation model. This model is trained to segment the corpus into semantically complete chunks. Second, to ensure that only the most relevant chunks are retrieved while the irrelevant ones are ignored, we design a chunk selection algorithm to dynamically select chunks based on the decreasing speed of the relevance score, leading to a more relevant selection. Third, to further ensure the precision of the retrieved chunks, we propose letting LLMs assess whether retrieved chunks are excessive or lacking and then adjust the amount of context accordingly. Experiments show that SAGE outperforms baselines by 61.25% in the quality of QA on average. Moreover, by avoiding retrieving noisy context, SAGE lowers the cost of the tokens consumed in LLM inference and achieves a 49.41% enhancement in cost efficiency on average. Additionally, our work offers valuable insights for boosting RAG.</p></details> |  |

To overcome the limitations of existing methods, this paper shifts away from prior dedicated heuristic approaches and revisits the most fundamental idea to HR perception by enhancing the long-context capability of MLLMs, driven by recent advances in long-context techniques like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for general LLMs. Towards this end, this paper presents the first study exploring the use of RAG to address HR perception challenges. Specifically, we propose Retrieval-Augmented Perception (RAP), a training-free framework that retrieves and fuses relevant image crops while preserving spatial context using the proposed Spatial-Awareness Layout. To accommodate different tasks, the proposed Retrieved-Exploration Search (RE-Search) dynamically selects the optimal number of crops based on model confidence and retrieval scores. Experimental results on HR benchmarks demonstrate the significant effectiveness of RAP, with LLaVA-v1.5-13B achieving a 43% improvement on $V^*$ Bench and 19% on HR-Bench.</p></details> |  |
| **[MMed-RAG: Versatile Multimodal RAG System for Medical Vision Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13085v2)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) has demonstrated significant potential in healthcare, particularly in disease diagnosis and treatment planning. Recent progress in Medical Large Vision-Language Models (Med-LVLMs) has opened up new possibilities for interactive diagnostic tools. However, these models often suffer from factual hallucination, which can lead to incorrect diagnoses. Fine-tuning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) have emerged as methods to address these issues. However, the amount of high-quality data and distribution shifts between training data and deployment data limit the application of fine-tuning methods. Although RAG is lightweight and effective, existing RAG-based approaches are not sufficiently general to different medical domains and can potentially cause misalignment issues, both between modalities and between the model and the ground truth. In this paper, we propose a versatile multimodal RAG system, MMed-RAG, designed to enhance the factuality of Med-LVLMs. Our approach introduces a domain-aware retrieval mechanism, an adaptive retrieved contexts selection method, and a provable RAG-based preference fine-tuning strategy. These innovations make the RAG process sufficiently general and reliable, significantly improving alignment when introducing retrieved contexts. Experimental results across five medical datasets (involving radiology, ophthalmology, pathology) on medical VQA and report generation demonstrate that MMed-RAG can achieve an average improvement of 43.8% in the factual accuracy of Med-LVLMs. Our data and code are available in https://github.com/richard-peng-xia/MMed-RAG.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

In this paper, we propose a generative AI-powered GATE question-answering framework (GATE stands for Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering) that leverages LLMs to explain GATE solutions and support students in their exam preparation. We conducted extensive benchmarking to select the optimal embedding model and LLM, evaluating our framework based on criteria such as latency, faithfulness, and relevance, with additional validation through human evaluation. Our chatbot integrates state-of-the-art embedding models and LLMs to deliver accurate, context-aware responses. Through rigorous experimentation, we identified configurations that balance performance and computational efficiency, ensuring a reliable chatbot to serve students' needs. Additionally, we discuss the challenges faced in data processing and modeling and implemented solutions. Our work explores the application of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for GATE Q/A explanation tasks, and our findings demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval accuracy and response quality. This research offers practical insights for developing effective AI-driven educational tools while highlighting areas for future enhancement in usability and scalability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Post-training an LLM for RAG? Train on Self-Generated Demonstrations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10596v2)** | 2025-03-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) often struggle with knowledge intensive NLP tasks, such as answering "Who won the latest World Cup?" because the knowledge they learn during training may be insufficient or outdated. Conditioning generation on retrieved documents -- a technique known as retrieval augmented generation (RAG) -- mitigates these shortcomings by allowing the model to leverage in-context information. Practitioners can improve LLM RAG performance by fine-tuning on retrieval-augmented instructions, but must beware that this can cause undesirable model behaviors like hallucinations. We attribute this degradation to the fact that the training data is likely to be out-of-distribution for the model and may suffer from quality issues, such as misalignment between retrievals and target responses (since retrievals are frequently added post-hoc). We propose a recipe for training RAG-enabled LLMs using self-generated demonstrations, thereby avoiding training on out-of-distribution text and integrating retrievals into the LLM responses. We evaluate our method on knowledge intensive question answering (QA) tasks and show that our method teaches LLMs to properly handle in-context retrievals and abstain from questions it will likely get wrong. Compared to conventional RA-IT methods, our method prevents model degradation in non-RAG settings while exhibiting superior QA performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[U-NIAH: Unified RAG and LLM Evaluation for Long Context Needle-In-A-Haystack](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00353v1)** | 2025-03-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have expanded their context windows to unprecedented lengths, sparking debates about the necessity of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). To address the fragmented evaluation paradigms and limited cases in existing Needle-in-a-Haystack (NIAH), this paper introduces U-NIAH, a unified framework that systematically compares LLMs and RAG methods in controlled long context settings. Our framework extends beyond traditional NIAH by incorporating multi-needle, long-needle, and needle-in-needle configurations, along with different retrieval settings, while leveraging the synthetic Starlight Academy dataset-a fictional magical universe-to eliminate biases from pre-trained knowledge. Through extensive experiments, we investigate three research questions: (1) performance trade-offs between LLMs and RAG, (2) error patterns in RAG, and (3) RAG's limitations in complex settings. Our findings show that RAG significantly enhances smaller LLMs by mitigating the "lost-in-the-middle" effect and improving robustness, achieving an 82.58% win-rate over LLMs. However, we observe that retrieval noise and reverse chunk ordering degrade performance, while surprisingly, advanced reasoning LLMs exhibit reduced RAG compatibility due to sensitivity to semantic distractors. We identify typical error patterns including omission due to noise, hallucination under high noise critical condition, and self-doubt behaviors. Our work not only highlights the complementary roles of RAG and LLMs, but also provides actionable insights for optimizing deployments.

However, these models face challenges in retrieving precise information from vast datasets. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) was developed to combining LLMs with external information retrieval systems to enhance the accuracy and context of responses. Despite improvements, RAG still struggles with comprehensive retrieval in high-volume, low-information-density databases and lacks relational awareness, leading to fragmented answers. To address this, this paper introduces the Pseudo-Knowledge Graph (PKG) framework, designed to overcome these limitations by integrating Meta-path Retrieval, In-graph Text and Vector Retrieval into LLMs. By preserving natural language text and leveraging various retrieval techniques, the PKG offers a richer knowledge representation and improves accuracy in information retrieval. Extensive evaluations using Open Compass and MultiHop-RAG benchmarks demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in managing large volumes of data and complex relationships.</p></details> |  |

However, these methods rely on unrealistic white-box assumptions, such as attackers having access to RAG systems' internal processes. To address this issue, we introduce a realistic black-box attack scenario based on the RAG paradox, where RAG systems inadvertently expose vulnerabilities while attempting to enhance trustworthiness. Because RAG systems reference external documents during response generation, our attack targets these sources without requiring internal access. Our approach first identifies the external sources disclosed by RAG systems and then automatically generates poisoned documents with misinformation designed to match these sources. Finally, these poisoned documents are newly published on the disclosed sources, disrupting the RAG system's response generation process. Both offline and online experiments confirm that this attack significantly reduces RAG performance without requiring internal access. Furthermore, from an insider perspective within the RAG system, we propose a re-ranking method that acts as a fundamental safeguard, offering minimal protection against unforeseen attacks.</p></details> |  |

Different from traditional RAG methods that mostly deal with flat text chunks, the proposed method takes into account the relationship of multimodalities by using a graph structure. To do that, a graph modeling structure is defined based on document layout parsing. The structure of an input document is retained with the connection of text chunks, tables, and figures. This representation allows the method to handle complex questions that require information from multimodalities. To confirm the efficiency of the graph modeling, a flexible RAG pipeline is developed using robust components. Experimental results on four benchmark test sets confirm the contribution of the layout-aware modeling for performance improvement of the RAG pipeline.</p></details> | <details><summary>NAACL...</summary><p>NAACL 2025, Industry Track</p></details> |

Recent RAG advancements focus on improving retrieval outcomes through iterative LLM refinement or self-critique capabilities acquired through additional instruction tuning of LLMs. In this work, we introduce Speculative RAG - a framework that leverages a larger generalist LM to efficiently verify multiple RAG drafts produced in parallel by a smaller, distilled specialist LM. Each draft is generated from a distinct subset of retrieved documents, offering diverse perspectives on the evidence while reducing input token counts per draft. This approach enhances comprehension of each subset and mitigates potential position bias over long context. Our method accelerates RAG by delegating drafting to the smaller specialist LM, with the larger generalist LM performing a single verification pass over the drafts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Speculative RAG achieves state-of-the-art performance with reduced latency on TriviaQA, MuSiQue, PopQA, PubHealth, and ARC-Challenge benchmarks. It notably enhances accuracy by up to 12.97% while reducing latency by 50.83% compared to conventional RAG systems on PubHealth.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025</p></details> |

Biomedical code mapping identifies similarity or equivalence between concepts from different ontologies. Obtaining high-quality mapping usually relies on automatic generation of unrefined mapping with ontology domain fine-tuned language models (LMs), followed by manual selections or corrections by coding experts who have extensive domain expertise and familiarity with ontology schemas. The LMs usually provide unrefined code mapping suggestions as a list of candidates without reasoning or supporting evidence, hence coding experts still need to verify each suggested candidate against ontology sources to pick the best matches. This is also a recurring task as ontology sources are updated regularly to incorporate new research findings. Consequently, the need of regular LM retraining and manual refinement make code mapping time-consuming and labour intensive. In this work, we created OntologyRAG, an ontology-enhanced retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) method that leverages the inductive biases from ontological knowledge graphs for in-context-learning (ICL) in large language models (LLMs). Our solution grounds LLMs to knowledge graphs with unrefined mappings between ontologies and processes questions by generating an interpretable set of results that include prediction rational with mapping proximity assessment. Our solution doesn't require re-training LMs, as all ontology updates could be reflected by updating the knowledge graphs with a standard process. Evaluation results on a self-curated gold dataset show promises of using our method to enable coding experts to achieve better and faster code mapping.

This includes the LLM, embedding, and ranker models themselves, as well as hyperparameters governing individual RAG components. Yet, collectively optimizing the entire configuration in a RAG or LLM system remains under-explored - especially in multi-objective settings - due to intractably large solution spaces, noisy objective evaluations, and the high cost of evaluations. In this work, we introduce the first approach for multi-objective parameter optimization of cost, latency, safety and alignment over entire LLM and RAG systems. We find that Bayesian optimization methods significantly outperform baseline approaches, obtaining a superior Pareto front on two new RAG benchmark tasks. We conclude our work with important considerations for practitioners who are designing multi-objective RAG systems, highlighting nuances such as how optimal configurations may not generalize across tasks and objectives.</p></details> |  |

The challenge of detecting such unauthorized usage remains underexplored, with datasets and methods from adjacent fields being ill-suited for its study. We take several steps to bridge this gap. First, we formalize this problem as (black-box) RAG Dataset Inference (RAG-DI). We then introduce a novel dataset designed for realistic benchmarking of RAG-DI methods, alongside a set of baselines. Finally, we propose Ward, a method for RAG-DI based on LLM watermarks that equips data owners with rigorous statistical guarantees regarding their dataset's misuse in RAG corpora. Ward consistently outperforms all baselines, achieving higher accuracy, superior query efficiency and robustness. Our work provides a foundation for future studies of RAG-DI and highlights LLM watermarks as a promising approach to this problem.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

Yet, most existing work in RAG has underemphasized fair ranking techniques and neglected the diverse interests of all stakeholders. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study of RAG systems that incorporate fairness-aware rankings, focusing on both ranking fairness and attribution fairness - ensuring equitable exposure of sources cited in the final text. We specifically examine item-side fairness, i.e., whether retrieved documents receive balanced exposure, and assess how this affects both the system's overall performance and the eventual distribution of cited sources. Across twelve RAG models and seven tasks, we find that fairness-aware retrieval frequently retains or even improves ranking effectiveness and generation quality, countering the widespread belief that fairness compromises system performance. Moreover, we show that fair retrieval leads to more balanced attribution in the final responses, ensuring that the cited sources are credited more equitably. Our results underscore the importance of item-side fairness throughout both retrieval and generation phases, offering key insights for building more responsible and equitable RAG systems and illustrating promising avenues for future exploration in fair ranking and source attribution.</p></details> | <details><summary>Top 5...</summary><p>Top 5 Spotlight at AFME Workshop at NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

The core of RAG is retrieving demonstration examples, which is essential to balance effectiveness (generation quality) and efficiency (retrieval time) for optimal performance. However, the high-dimensional nature of code representations and large knowledge bases often create efficiency bottlenecks, which are overlooked in previous research. This paper systematically evaluates the efficiency-effectiveness trade-off of retrievers across three coding tasks: Program Synthesis, Commit Message Generation, and Assertion Generation. We examined six retrievers: two sparse (BM25 and BM25L) and four dense retrievers, including one exhaustive dense retriever (SBERT's Semantic Search) and three approximate dense retrievers (ANNOY, LSH, and HNSW). Our findings show that while BM25 excels in effectiveness, it suffers in efficiency as the knowledge base grows beyond 1000 entries. In large-scale retrieval, efficiency differences become more pronounced, with approximate dense retrievers offering the greatest gains. For instance, in Commit Generation task, HNSW achieves a 44x speed up, while only with a 1.74% drop in RougeL compared with BM25. Our results also show that increasing the number of demonstrations in the prompt doesn't always improve the effectiveness and can increase latency and lead to incorrect outputs. Our findings provide valuable insights for practitioners aiming to build efficient and effective RAG systems for coding tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 6 figures, 6 tables, accepted by SANER 2025</p></details> |

In this work, we study the conflict between biases of each component and their relationship to the overall bias of the RAG system, which we call bias conflict. Examining both gender and political biases as case studies, we show that bias conflict can be characterized through a linear relationship among components despite its complexity in 6 different LLMs. Through comprehensive fine-tuning experiments creating 120 differently biased embedders, we demonstrate how to control bias while maintaining utility and reveal the importance of reverse-biasing the embedder to mitigate bias in the overall system. Additionally, we find that LLMs and tasks exhibit varying sensitivities to the embedder bias, a crucial factor to consider for debiasing. Our results underscore that a fair RAG system can be better achieved by carefully controlling the bias of the embedder rather than increasing its fairness.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages (8 main), 12 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

We present LettuceDetect a framework that addresses two critical limitations in existing hallucination detection methods: (1) the context window constraints of traditional encoder-based methods, and (2) the computational inefficiency of LLM based approaches. Building on ModernBERT's extended context capabilities (up to 8k tokens) and trained on the RAGTruth benchmark dataset, our approach outperforms all previous encoder-based models and most prompt-based models, while being approximately 30 times smaller than the best models. LettuceDetect is a token-classification model that processes context-question-answer triples, allowing for the identification of unsupported claims at the token level. Evaluations on the RAGTruth corpus demonstrate an F1 score of 79.22% for example-level detection, which is a 14.8% improvement over Luna, the previous state-of-the-art encoder-based architecture. Additionally, the system can process 30 to 60 examples per second on a single GPU, making it more practical for real-world RAG applications.</p></details> | 6 pages |

However, RAG introduces challenges such as retrieval latency, potential errors in document selection, and increased system complexity. With the advent of large language models (LLMs) featuring significantly extended context windows, this paper proposes an alternative paradigm, cache-augmented generation (CAG) that bypasses real-time retrieval. Our method involves preloading all relevant resources, especially when the documents or knowledge for retrieval are of a limited and manageable size, into the LLM's extended context and caching its runtime parameters. During inference, the model utilizes these preloaded parameters to answer queries without additional retrieval steps. Comparative analyses reveal that CAG eliminates retrieval latency and minimizes retrieval errors while maintaining context relevance. Performance evaluations across multiple benchmarks highlight scenarios where long-context LLMs either outperform or complement traditional RAG pipelines. These findings suggest that, for certain applications, particularly those with a constrained knowledge base, CAG provide a streamlined and efficient alternative to RAG, achieving comparable or superior results with reduced complexity.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, accepted by the Web Conference 2025 (WWW '25) as a short paper</p></details> |
| **[Worse than Zero-shot? A Fact-Checking Dataset for Evaluating the Robustness of RAG Against Misleading Retrievals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16101v1)** | 2025-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has shown impressive capabilities in mitigating hallucinations in large language models (LLMs). However, LLMs struggle to handle misleading retrievals and often fail to maintain their own reasoning when exposed to conflicting or selectively-framed evidence, making them vulnerable to real-world misinformation. In such real-world retrieval scenarios, misleading and conflicting information is rampant, particularly in the political domain, where evidence is often selectively framed, incomplete, or polarized. However, existing RAG benchmarks largely assume a clean retrieval setting, where models succeed by accurately retrieving and generating answers from gold-standard documents. This assumption fails to align with real-world conditions, leading to an overestimation of RAG system performance. To bridge this gap, we introduce RAGuard, a fact-checking dataset designed to evaluate the robustness of RAG systems against misleading retrievals. Unlike prior benchmarks that rely on synthetic noise, our dataset constructs its retrieval corpus from Reddit discussions, capturing naturally occurring misinformation. It categorizes retrieved evidence into three types: supporting, misleading, and irrelevant, providing a realistic and challenging testbed for assessing how well RAG systems navigate different retrieval information. Our benchmark experiments reveal that when exposed to misleading retrievals, all tested LLM-powered RAG systems perform worse than their zero-shot baselines (i.e., no retrieval at all), highlighting their susceptibility to noisy environments. To the best of our knowledge, RAGuard is the first benchmark to systematically assess RAG robustness against misleading evidence. We expect this benchmark will drive future research toward improving RAG systems beyond idealized datasets, making them more reliable for real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

However, due to access restrictions, Large Language Models (LLMs) cannot retrieve these internal documents, limiting their ability to generate accurate zero-shot responses. To overcome this limitation, we use a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework powered by a Knowledge Graph (KG) to retrieve relevant information from external knowledge sources, enabling LLMs to answer questions over private or previously unseen document collections. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for building a high-quality, low-noise KG. We apply several techniques, including incremental entity resolution using seed concepts, similarity-based filtering to deduplicate entries, assigning confidence scores to entity-relation pairs to filter for high-confidence pairs, and linking facts to source documents for provenance. Our KG-RAG system retrieves relevant tuples, which are added to the user prompts context before being sent to the LLM generating the response. Our evaluation demonstrates that this approach significantly enhances response relevance, reducing irrelevant answers by over 50% and increasing fully relevant answers by 88% compared to the existing production system.</p></details> |  |
| **[Chain-of-Rank: Enhancing Large Language Models for Domain-Specific RAG in Edge Device](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15134v1)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with large language models (LLMs) is especially valuable in specialized domains, where precision is critical. To more specialize the LLMs into a target domain, domain-specific RAG has recently been developed by allowing the LLM to access the target domain early via finetuning. The domain-specific RAG makes more sense in resource-constrained environments like edge devices, as they should perform a specific task (e.g. personalization) reliably using only small-scale LLMs. While the domain-specific RAG is well-aligned with edge devices in this respect, it often relies on widely-used reasoning techniques like chain-of-thought (CoT). The reasoning step is useful to understand the given external knowledge, and yet it is computationally expensive and difficult for small-scale LLMs to learn it. Tackling this, we propose the Chain of Rank (CoR) which shifts the focus from intricate lengthy reasoning to simple ranking of the reliability of input external documents. Then, CoR reduces computational complexity while maintaining high accuracy, making it particularly suited for resource-constrained environments. We attain the state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in benchmarks, and analyze its efficacy.</p></details> | <details><summary>NAACL...</summary><p>NAACL 2025 (Findings)</p></details> |

Different from a standard retrieval task's objective of maximising the relevance of a set of top-ranked documents, a RAG system's objective is rather to maximise their total utility, where the utility of a document indicates whether including it as a part of the additional contextual information in an LLM prompt improves a downstream task. Existing studies investigate the role of the relevance of a RAG context for knowledge-intensive language tasks (KILT), where relevance essentially takes the form of answer containment. In contrast, in our work, relevance corresponds to that of topical overlap between a query and a document for an information seeking task. Specifically, we make use of an IR test collection to empirically investigate whether a RAG context comprised of topically relevant documents leads to improved downstream performance. Our experiments lead to the following findings: (a) there is a small positive correlation between relevance and utility; (b) this correlation decreases with increasing context sizes (higher values of k in k-shot); and (c) a more effective retrieval model generally leads to better downstream RAG performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages (including reference), 5 figures, 1 table, 48 references; this paper has been accepted by ECIR'25 as a full paper</p></details> |

Such agents have the potential for broad use. We illustrate with a sample application called CollabNext, which is a person-centric knowledge graph connecting people, organizations, and research topics.

Given the challenges in continual learning with large language models (LLMs), retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become the dominant way to introduce new information. However, its reliance on vector retrieval hinders its ability to mimic the dynamic and interconnected nature of human long-term memory. Recent RAG approaches augment vector embeddings with various structures like knowledge graphs to address some of these gaps, namely sense-making and associativity. However, their performance on more basic factual memory tasks drops considerably below standard RAG. We address this unintended deterioration and propose HippoRAG 2, a framework that outperforms standard RAG comprehensively on factual, sense-making, and associative memory tasks. HippoRAG 2 builds upon the Personalized PageRank algorithm used in HippoRAG and enhances it with deeper passage integration and more effective online use of an LLM. This combination pushes this RAG system closer to the effectiveness of human long-term memory, achieving a 7% improvement in associative memory tasks over the state-of-the-art embedding model while also exhibiting superior factual knowledge and sense-making memory capabilities. This work paves the way for non-parametric continual learning for LLMs. Our code and data will be released at https://github.com/OSU-NLP-Group/HippoRAG.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and data to be released at: https://github.com/OSU-NLP-Group/HippoRAG</p></details> |

However, existing large language models (LLMs) face challenges in personalized recommendation capabilities and the generation of content that can sometimes produce hallucinations. This study proposes an optimization scheme for Tibet tourism LLMs based on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) technology. By constructing a database of tourist viewpoints and processing the data using vectorization techniques, we have significantly improved retrieval accuracy. The application of RAG technology effectively addresses the hallucination problem in content generation. The optimized model shows significant improvements in fluency, accuracy, and relevance of content generation.

However, when the retrieval process involves private data, RAG systems may face severe privacy risks, potentially leading to the leakage of sensitive information. To address this issue, we propose using synthetic data as a privacy-preserving alternative for the retrieval data. We propose SAGE, a novel two-stage synthetic data generation paradigm. In the stage-1, we employ an attribute-based extraction and generation approach to preserve key contextual information from the original data. In the stage-2, we further enhance the privacy properties of the synthetic data through an agent-based iterative refinement process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that using our synthetic data as the retrieval context achieves comparable performance to using the original data while substantially reducing privacy risks. Our work takes the first step towards investigating the possibility of generating high-utility and privacy-preserving synthetic data for RAG, opening up new opportunities for the safe application of RAG systems in various domains.</p></details> |  |

This is critical given existing workforce shortages, especially in marginalized communities like Underrepresented Minorities (URM), who often lack access to quality education. Addressing these challenges, this research presents gAI-PT4I4, a Generative AI-based Personalized Tutor for Industrial 4.0, designed to personalize 4IR experiential learning. gAI-PT4I4 employs sentiment analysis to assess student comprehension, leveraging generative AI and finite automaton to tailor learning experiences. The framework integrates low-fidelity Digital Twins for VR-based training, featuring an Interactive Tutor - a generative AI assistant providing real-time guidance via audio and text. It uses zero-shot sentiment analysis with LLMs and prompt engineering, achieving 86\% accuracy in classifying student-teacher interactions as positive or negative. Additionally, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enables personalized learning content grounded in domain-specific knowledge. To adapt training dynamically, finite automaton structures exercises into states of increasing difficulty, requiring 80\% task-performance accuracy for progression. Experimental evaluation with 22 volunteers showed improved accuracy exceeding 80\%, reducing training time. Finally, this paper introduces a Multi-Fidelity Digital Twin model, aligning Digital Twin complexity with Bloom's Taxonomy and Kirkpatrick's model, providing a scalable educational framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Local to Global: A Graph RAG Approach to Query-Focused Summarization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16130v2)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The use of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to retrieve relevant information from an external knowledge source enables large language models (LLMs) to answer questions over private and/or previously unseen document collections. However, RAG fails on global questions directed at an entire text corpus, such as "What are the main themes in the dataset?", since this is inherently a query-focused summarization (QFS) task, rather than an explicit retrieval task. Prior QFS methods, meanwhile, do not scale to the quantities of text indexed by typical RAG systems. To combine the strengths of these contrasting methods, we propose GraphRAG, a graph-based approach to question answering over private text corpora that scales with both the generality of user questions and the quantity of source text. Our approach uses an LLM to build a graph index in two stages: first, to derive an entity knowledge graph from the source documents, then to pregenerate community summaries for all groups of closely related entities. Given a question, each community summary is used to generate a partial response, before all partial responses are again summarized in a final response to the user. For a class of global sensemaking questions over datasets in the 1 million token range, we show that GraphRAG leads to substantial improvements over a conventional RAG baseline for both the comprehensiveness and diversity of generated answers.</p></details> |  |

To comprehensively evaluate the resilience of current RAG methods, we introduce HawkBench, a human-labeled, multi-domain benchmark designed to rigorously assess RAG performance across categorized task types. By stratifying tasks based on information-seeking behaviors, HawkBench provides a systematic evaluation of how well RAG systems adapt to diverse user needs. Unlike existing benchmarks, which focus primarily on specific task types (mostly factoid queries) and rely on varying knowledge bases, HawkBench offers: (1) systematic task stratification to cover a broad range of query types, including both factoid and rationale queries, (2) integration of multi-domain corpora across all task types to mitigate corpus bias, and (3) rigorous annotation for high-quality evaluation. HawkBench includes 1,600 high-quality test samples, evenly distributed across domains and task types. Using this benchmark, we evaluate representative RAG methods, analyzing their performance in terms of answer quality and response latency. Our findings highlight the need for dynamic task strategies that integrate decision-making, query interpretation, and global knowledge understanding to improve RAG generalizability. We believe HawkBench serves as a pivotal benchmark for advancing the resilience of RAG methods and their ability to achieve general-purpose information seeking.</p></details> | 13 pages |

It has been shown to enhance both generation quality and trustworthiness. While numerous works have focused on improving retrieval, generation, and evaluation, the role of reward models in reinforcement learning for optimizing RAG remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{RAG-Reward}, a framework designed to develop reward models to enable \textit{hallucination-free, comprehensive, reliable, and efficient RAG}. We define four key metrics to assess generation quality and develop an automated benchmarking pipeline to evaluate the outputs of multiple LLMs across a variety of RAG scenarios. Using \textbf{RAG-Reward}, we train reward models and apply {reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF)} to improve LLMs' effectiveness in RAG. Experimental results demonstrate that our reward model achieves state-of-the-art performance in automatic benchmarking and aligns closely with human evaluations. Furthermore, the improved generation quality of the trained policy model highlights the feasibility and efficiency of using RLHF to enhance RAG outputs.</p></details> | Preprint |

In this paper, we introduce an omnidirectional and automatic RAG benchmark, OmniEval, in the financial domain. Our benchmark is characterized by its multi-dimensional evaluation framework, including (1) a matrix-based RAG scenario evaluation system that categorizes queries into five task classes and 16 financial topics, leading to a structured assessment of diverse query scenarios; (2) a multi-dimensional evaluation data generation approach, which combines GPT-4-based automatic generation and human annotation, achieving an 87.47\% acceptance ratio in human evaluations on generated instances; (3) a multi-stage evaluation system that evaluates both retrieval and generation performance, result in a comprehensive evaluation on the RAG pipeline; and (4) robust evaluation metrics derived from rule-based and LLM-based ones, enhancing the reliability of assessments through manual annotations and supervised fine-tuning of an LLM evaluator. Our experiments demonstrate the comprehensiveness of OmniEval, which includes extensive test datasets and highlights the performance variations of RAG systems across diverse topics and tasks, revealing significant opportunities for RAG models to improve their capabilities in vertical domains. We open source the code of our benchmark in \href{https://github.com/RUC-NLPIR/OmniEval}{https://github.com/RUC-NLPIR/OmniEval}.</p></details> |  |
| **[Systematic Knowledge Injection into Large Language Models via Diverse Augmentation for Domain-Specific RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08356v2)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a prominent method for incorporating domain knowledge into Large Language Models (LLMs). While RAG enhances response relevance by incorporating retrieved domain knowledge in the context, retrieval errors can still lead to hallucinations and incorrect answers. To recover from retriever failures, domain knowledge is injected by fine-tuning the model to generate the correct response, even in the case of retrieval errors. However, we observe that without systematic knowledge augmentation, fine-tuned LLMs may memorize new information but still fail to extract relevant domain knowledge, leading to poor performance. In this work, we present a novel framework that significantly enhances the fine-tuning process by augmenting the training data in two ways -- context augmentation and knowledge paraphrasing. In context augmentation, we create multiple training samples for a given QA pair by varying the relevance of the retrieved information, teaching the model when to ignore and when to rely on retrieved content. In knowledge paraphrasing, we fine-tune with multiple answers to the same question, enabling LLMs to better internalize specialized knowledge. To mitigate catastrophic forgetting due to fine-tuning, we add a domain-specific identifier to a question and also utilize a replay buffer containing general QA pairs. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our method over existing techniques, achieving up to 10\% relative gain in token-level recall while preserving the LLM's generalization capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 14 tables, to be published in NAACL 2025</p></details> |
| **[Does RAG Really Perform Bad For Long-Context Processing?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11444v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The efficient processing of long context poses a serious challenge for large language models (LLMs). Recently, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising strategy for this problem, as it enables LLMs to make selective use of the long context for efficient computation. However, existing RAG approaches lag behind other long-context processing methods due to inherent limitations on inaccurate retrieval and fragmented contexts. To address these challenges, we introduce RetroLM, a novel RAG framework for long-context processing. Unlike traditional methods, RetroLM employs KV-level retrieval augmentation, where it partitions the LLM's KV cache into contiguous pages and retrieves the most crucial ones for efficient computation. This approach enhances robustness to retrieval inaccuracy, facilitates effective utilization of fragmented contexts, and saves the cost from repeated computation. Building on this framework, we further develop a specialized retriever for precise retrieval of critical pages and conduct unsupervised post-training to optimize the model's ability to leverage retrieved information. We conduct comprehensive evaluations with a variety of benchmarks, including LongBench, InfiniteBench, and RULER, where RetroLM significantly outperforms existing long-context LLMs and efficient long-context processing methods, particularly in tasks requiring intensive reasoning or extremely long-context comprehension.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revisiting Robust RAG: Do We Still Need Complex Robust Training in the Era of Powerful LLMs?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11400v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems often suffer from performance degradation when encountering noisy or irrelevant documents, driving researchers to develop sophisticated training strategies to enhance their robustness against such retrieval noise. However, as large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, the necessity of these complex training methods is increasingly questioned. In this paper, we systematically investigate whether complex robust training strategies remain necessary as model capacity grows. Through comprehensive experiments spanning multiple model architectures and parameter scales, we evaluate various document selection methods and adversarial training techniques across diverse datasets. Our extensive experiments consistently demonstrate that as models become more powerful, the performance gains brought by complex robust training methods drop off dramatically. We delve into the rationale and find that more powerful models inherently exhibit superior confidence calibration, better generalization across datasets (even when trained with randomly selected documents), and optimal attention mechanisms learned with simpler strategies. Our findings suggest that RAG systems can benefit from simpler architectures and training strategies as models become more powerful, enabling more scalable applications with minimal complexity.</p></details> |  |

It mainly consists of retrieval and generation. The retrieval modules (a.k.a. retrievers) aim to find useful information used to facilitate the generation modules (a.k.a. generators). As such, generators' performance largely depends on the effectiveness and efficiency of retrievers. However, the widely used retrieval paradigm remains flat. It treats retrieval procedures as a one-off deal with constant granularity. Despite effectiveness, we argue that they suffer from two limitations: (1) flat retrieval exerts a significant burden on one retriever; (2) constant granularity limits the ceiling of retrieval performance. In this work, we propose a progressive retrieval paradigm with coarse-to-fine granularity for RAG, termed FunnelRAG, so as to balance effectiveness and efficiency. Specifically, FunnelRAG establishes a progressive retrieval pipeline by collaborating coarse-to-fine granularity, large-to-small quantity, and low-to-high capacity, which can relieve the burden on one retriever and also promote the ceiling of retrieval performance. Extensive experiments manifest that FunnelRAG achieves comparable retrieval performance while the time overhead is reduced by nearly 40 percent.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 6 figures, 13 tables.

For structured data, such as knowledge graphs, GraphRAG has been widely used to retrieve relevant information. However, recent studies have revealed that structuring implicit knowledge from text into graphs can benefit certain tasks, extending the application of GraphRAG from graph data to general text-based data. Despite their successful extensions, most applications of GraphRAG for text data have been designed for specific tasks and datasets, lacking a systematic evaluation and comparison between RAG and GraphRAG on widely used text-based benchmarks. In this paper, we systematically evaluate RAG and GraphRAG on well-established benchmark tasks, such as Question Answering and Query-based Summarization. Our results highlight the distinct strengths of RAG and GraphRAG across different tasks and evaluation perspectives. Inspired by these observations, we investigate strategies to integrate their strengths to improve downstream tasks. Additionally, we provide an in-depth discussion of the shortcomings of current GraphRAG approaches and outline directions for future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Investigating Language Preference of Multilingual RAG Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11175v1)** | 2025-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multilingual Retrieval-Augmented Generation (mRAG) systems enhance language models by integrating external multilingual information to produce context-aware responses. However, mRAG systems struggle with retrieving relevant information due to linguistic variations between queries and documents, generating inconsistent responses when multilingual sources conflict. In this work, we systematically investigate language preferences in both retrieval and generation of mRAG through a series of experiments. Our analysis indicates that retrievers tend to prefer high-resource and query languages, yet this preference does not consistently improve generation performance. Moreover, we observe that generators prefer the query language or Latin scripts, leading to inconsistent outputs. To overcome these issues, we propose Dual Knowledge Multilingual RAG (DKM-RAG), a simple yet effective framework that fuses translated multilingual passages with complementary model knowledge. Empirical results demonstrate that DKM-RAG mitigates language preference in generation and enhances performance across diverse linguistic settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 16 tables, 14 figures</p></details> |

These two capabilities are complementary to each other and essential for LLMs to process large volumes of information that cannot fit into a single prompt. We present a detailed continued training recipe to extend the context window of Llama3-70B-base from 8K to 128K tokens, along with a three-stage instruction tuning process to enhance the model's instruction-following, RAG performance, and long-context understanding capabilities. Our results demonstrate that the Llama3-ChatQA-2-70B model outperforms most existing state-of-the-art models, including GPT-4-Turbo-2024-04-09, Qwen2-72B-Instruct, and Llama3.1-70B-Instruct, on ultra-long tasks beyond 100K tokens, as well as on the RAG benchmark using only a 4K context window, showing the strong long context capability across varying sequence lengths. We further provide extensive comparisons between direct long-context and RAG solutions using the same state-of-the-art long-context LLMs. Interestingly, we find that the performance of strong long-context LLMs using RAG improves when retrieving a larger number of chunks. With a large set of top-k chunks, RAG consistently outperforms direct long-context solution using the same state-of-the-art long-context models (e.g., Llama3-ChatQA-2-70B and Qwen2-72B-Instruct) on both 32K and 128K benchmarks.

RAG integrates external knowledge to enhance factual consistency in generative outputs, while LoRA enables parameter-efficient fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs). DoRA further refines this process by optimizing fine-tuning through adaptive parameter ranking and domain-aware weight adjustments, improving learning efficiency while maintaining inference performance. This paper presents a large-scale empirical evaluation of RAG, LoRA, and DoRA, with model fine-tuning and generation performance assessed on 20,000 FAQ-based queries, while the knowledge base spans 400,000 entries. The study analyzes key performance metrics such as accuracy, relevance, and inference latency. Experimental results demonstrate that DoRA achieves the highest accuracy (90.1%), relevance score (0.88), and lowest latency (110 ms per query), outperforming both LoRA and RAG in real-world, domain-specific generative AI applications. Furthermore, this study examines the trade-offs between fine-tuning efficiency, computational cost, and real-time adaptability across different models. Findings highlight RAG's effectiveness in knowledge grounding, LoRA's cost-efficient domain adaptation, and DoRA's ability to balance fine-tuning efficiency with model precision. These insights provide practical guidance for deploying AI-driven generative systems in accuracy-critical domains such as healthcare, finance, and legal services, ensuring scalability, reliability, and optimal performance in dynamic environments.</p></details> | 10 Pages |

To overcome these limitations, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) incorporates up-to-date external information into LLMs without extensive fine-tuning. Meanwhile, small language models (SLMs) deployed on edge devices offer efficiency and low latency but often struggle with complex reasoning tasks. Unfortunately, current RAG approaches are predominantly based on centralized databases and have not been adapted to address the distinct constraints associated with deploying SLMs in edge environments. To bridge this gap, we propose Edge-Assisted and Collaborative RAG (EACO-RAG), a lightweight framework that leverages distributed edge nodes for adaptive knowledge updates and retrieval. EACO-RAG also employs a hierarchical collaborative gating mechanism to dynamically select among local, edge-assisted, and cloud-based strategies, with a carefully designed algorithm based on Safe Online Bayesian Optimization to maximize the potential performance enhancements. Experimental results demonstrate that EACO-RAG matches the accuracy of cloud-based knowledge graph RAG systems while reducing total costs by up to 84.6% under relaxed delay constraints and by 65.3% under stricter delay requirements. This work represents our initial effort toward achieving a distributed and scalable tiered LLM deployments, with EACO-RAG serving as a promising first step in unlocking the full potential of hybrid edge-cloud intelligence.</p></details> |  |
| **[KET-RAG: A Cost-Efficient Multi-Granular Indexing Framework for Graph-RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09304v1)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph-RAG constructs a knowledge graph from text chunks to improve retrieval in Large Language Model (LLM)-based question answering. It is particularly useful in domains such as biomedicine, law, and political science, where retrieval often requires multi-hop reasoning over proprietary documents. Some existing Graph-RAG systems construct KNN graphs based on text chunk relevance, but this coarse-grained approach fails to capture entity relationships within texts, leading to sub-par retrieval and generation quality. To address this, recent solutions leverage LLMs to extract entities and relationships from text chunks, constructing triplet-based knowledge graphs. However, this approach incurs significant indexing costs, especially for large document collections. To ensure a good result accuracy while reducing the indexing cost, we propose KET-RAG, a multi-granular indexing framework. KET-RAG first identifies a small set of key text chunks and leverages an LLM to construct a knowledge graph skeleton. It then builds a text-keyword bipartite graph from all text chunks, serving as a lightweight alternative to a full knowledge graph. During retrieval, KET-RAG searches both structures: it follows the local search strategy of existing Graph-RAG systems on the skeleton while mimicking this search on the bipartite graph to improve retrieval quality. We evaluate eight solutions on two real-world datasets, demonstrating that KET-RAG outperforms all competitors in indexing cost, retrieval effectiveness, and generation quality. Notably, it achieves comparable or superior retrieval quality to Microsoft's Graph-RAG while reducing indexing costs by over an order of magnitude. Additionally, it improves the generation quality by up to 32.4% while lowering indexing costs by around 20%.</p></details> |  |

However, RAG still struggles to fully prevent hallucinated responses. To address this, it is essential to identify samples prone to hallucination or guide LLMs toward correct responses, which experts then annotate to develop high-quality datasets for refining LLMs. However, the growing scarcity of such datasets makes their creation challenging. This paper proposes using the vast amount of conversations from widespread LLM usage to build these datasets, training LLMs to avoid hallucination-prone questions while accurately responding to manageable ones. Given the impracticality of expert-annotating all conversation records, the paper introduces AL4RAG, which uses active learning to select the most suitable conversation samples for annotation, optimizing performance within an annotation budget. Additionally, recognizing that traditional active learning methods are not fully compatible with RAG due to unsuitable distance metrics, we develop a novel sample distance measurement for RAG active learning. Extensive experiments show that our method consistently outperforms baselines across multiple metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diversity Enhances an LLM's Performance in RAG and Long-context Task](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09017v1)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have highlighted the challenge of context window limitations, primarily due to the quadratic time complexity of the self-attention mechanism (\(O(N^2)\), where \(N\) denotes the context window length). This constraint impacts tasks such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) in question answering (Q\&A) and long context summarization. A common approach involves selecting content with the highest similarity to the query; however, this often leads to redundancy and the exclusion of diverse yet relevant information. Building on principles from Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) and Farthest Point Sampling (FPS), we integrate diversity into the content selection process. Our findings reveal that incorporating diversity substantially increases the recall of selecting relevant sentences or chunks before LLM-based Q\&A and summarization. These results highlight the importance of maintaining diversity in future LLM applications to further improve summarization and Q\&A outcomes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Better RAG using Relevant Information Gain](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12101v2)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A common way to extend the memory of large language models (LLMs) is by retrieval augmented generation (RAG), which inserts text retrieved from a larger memory into an LLM's context window. However, the context window is typically limited to several thousand tokens, which limits the number of retrieved passages that can inform a model's response. For this reason, it's important to avoid occupying context window space with redundant information by ensuring a degree of diversity among retrieved passages. At the same time, the information should also be relevant to the current task. Most prior methods that encourage diversity among retrieved results, such as Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR), do so by incorporating an objective that explicitly trades off diversity and relevance. We propose a novel simple optimization metric based on relevant information gain, a probabilistic measure of the total information relevant to a query for a set of retrieved results. By optimizing this metric, diversity organically emerges from our system. When used as a drop-in replacement for the retrieval component of a RAG system, this method yields state-of-the-art performance on question answering tasks from the Retrieval Augmented Generation Benchmark (RGB), outperforming existing metrics that directly optimize for relevance and diversity.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 page paper submitted to EMNLP</p></details> |

However, current implementations face two critical challenges: maintaining factual accuracy and delivering coherent, context-aware instruction. While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) partially addresses these issues, its reliance on pure semantic similarity limits its effectiveness in educational contexts where conceptual relationships are crucial.

| **[A RAG Approach for Generating Competency Questions in Ontology Engineering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08820v2)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Competency question (CQ) formulation is central to several ontology development and evaluation methodologies. Traditionally, the task of crafting these competency questions heavily relies on the effort of domain experts and knowledge engineers which is often time-consuming and labor-intensive. With the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs), there arises the possibility to automate and enhance this process. Unlike other similar works which use existing ontologies or knowledge graphs as input to LLMs, we present a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approach that uses LLMs for the automatic generation of CQs given a set of scientific papers considered to be a domain knowledge base. We investigate its performance and specifically, we study the impact of different number of papers to the RAG and different temperature setting of the LLM. We conduct experiments using GPT-4 on two domain ontology engineering tasks and compare results against ground-truth CQs constructed by domain experts. Empirical assessments on the results, utilizing evaluation metrics (precision and consistency), reveal that compared to zero-shot prompting, adding relevant domain knowledge to the RAG improves the performance of LLMs on generating CQs for concrete ontology engineering tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph RAG-Tool Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07223v1)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent developments in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for selecting relevant tools from a tool knowledge base enable LLM agents to scale their complex tool calling capabilities to hundreds or thousands of external tools, APIs, or agents-as-tools. However, traditional RAG-based tool retrieval fails to capture structured dependencies between tools, limiting the retrieval accuracy of a retrieved tool's dependencies. For example, among a vector database of tools, a "get stock price" API requires a "stock ticker" parameter from a "get stock ticker" API, and both depend on OS-level internet connectivity tools. In this paper, we address this limitation by introducing Graph RAG-Tool Fusion, a novel plug-and-play approach that combines the strengths of vector-based retrieval with efficient graph traversal to capture all relevant tools (nodes) along with any nested dependencies (edges) within the predefined tool knowledge graph. We also present ToolLinkOS, a new tool selection benchmark of 573 fictional tools, spanning over 15 industries, each with an average of 6.3 tool dependencies. We demonstrate that Graph RAG-Tool Fusion achieves absolute improvements of 71.7% and 22.1% over na\"ive RAG on ToolLinkOS and ToolSandbox benchmarks, respectively (mAP@10). ToolLinkOS dataset is available at https://github.com/EliasLumer/Graph-RAG-Tool-Fusion-ToolLinkOS</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 14 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Transparent NLP: Using RAG and LLM Alignment for Privacy Q&A](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06652v1)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The transparency principle of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requires data processing information to be clear, precise, and accessible. While language models show promise in this context, their probabilistic nature complicates truthfulness and comprehensibility. This paper examines state-of-the-art Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enhanced with alignment techniques to fulfill GDPR obligations. We evaluate RAG systems incorporating an alignment module like Rewindable Auto-regressive Inference (RAIN) and our proposed multidimensional extension, MultiRAIN, using a Privacy Q&A dataset. Responses are optimized for preciseness and comprehensibility and are assessed through 21 metrics, including deterministic and large language model-based evaluations. Our results show that RAG systems with an alignment module outperform baseline RAG systems on most metrics, though none fully match human answers. Principal component analysis of the results reveals complex interactions between metrics, highlighting the need to refine metrics. This study provides a foundation for integrating advanced natural language processing systems into legal compliance frameworks.</p></details> | Submitted to ARR |
| **[LemmaHead: RAG Assisted Proof Generation Using Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15797v4)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developing the logic necessary to solve mathematical problems or write mathematical proofs is one of the more difficult objectives for large language models (LLMS). Currently, the most popular methods in literature consists of fine-tuning the model on written mathematical content such as academic publications and textbooks, so that the model can learn to emulate the style of mathematical writing. In this project, we explore the effectiveness of using retrieval augmented generation (RAG) to address gaps in the mathematical reasoning of LLMs. We develop LemmaHead, a RAG knowledge base that supplements queries to the model with relevant mathematical context, with particular focus on context from published textbooks. To measure our model's performance in mathematical reasoning, our testing paradigm focuses on the task of automated theorem proving via generating proofs to a given mathematical claim in the Lean formal language.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quality Assurance for LLM-RAG Systems: Empirical Insights from Tourism Application Testing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05782v1)** | 2025-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a comprehensive framework for testing and evaluating quality characteristics of Large Language Model (LLM) systems enhanced with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in tourism applications. Through systematic empirical evaluation of three different LLM variants across multiple parameter configurations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our testing methodology in assessing both functional correctness and extra-functional properties. Our framework implements 17 distinct metrics that encompass syntactic analysis, semantic evaluation, and behavioral evaluation through LLM judges. The study reveals significant information about how different architectural choices and parameter configurations affect system performance, particularly highlighting the impact of temperature and top-p parameters on response quality. The tests were carried out on a tourism recommendation system for the V\"armland region, utilizing standard and RAG-enhanced configurations. The results indicate that the newer LLM versions show modest improvements in performance metrics, though the differences are more pronounced in response length and complexity rather than in semantic quality. The research contributes practical insights for implementing robust testing practices in LLM-RAG systems, providing valuable guidance to organizations deploying these architectures in production environments.</p></details> | 10 pages |

Typically, such RAG systems retrieve search results, download HTML sources of the results, and then extract plain texts from the HTML sources. Plain text documents or chunks are fed into the LLMs to augment the generation. However, much of the structural and semantic information inherent in HTML, such as headings and table structures, is lost during this plain-text-based RAG process. To alleviate this problem, we propose HtmlRAG, which uses HTML instead of plain text as the format of retrieved knowledge in RAG. We believe HTML is better than plain text in modeling knowledge in external documents, and most LLMs possess robust capacities to understand HTML. However, utilizing HTML presents new challenges. HTML contains additional content such as tags, JavaScript, and CSS specifications, which bring extra input tokens and noise to the RAG system. To address this issue, we propose HTML cleaning, compression, and a two-step block-tree-based pruning strategy, to shorten the HTML while minimizing the loss of information. Experiments on six QA datasets confirm the superiority of using HTML in RAG systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by WWW 2025 main conference.

| **[Enhancing Health Information Retrieval with RAG by Prioritizing Topical Relevance and Factual Accuracy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04666v1)** | 2025-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The exponential surge in online health information, coupled with its increasing use by non-experts, highlights the pressing need for advanced Health Information Retrieval models that consider not only topical relevance but also the factual accuracy of the retrieved information, given the potential risks associated with health misinformation. To this aim, this paper introduces a solution driven by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which leverages the capabilities of generative Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance the retrieval of health-related documents grounded in scientific evidence. In particular, we propose a three-stage model: in the first stage, the user's query is employed to retrieve topically relevant passages with associated references from a knowledge base constituted by scientific literature. In the second stage, these passages, alongside the initial query, are processed by LLMs to generate a contextually relevant rich text (GenText). In the last stage, the documents to be retrieved are evaluated and ranked both from the point of view of topical relevance and factual accuracy by means of their comparison with GenText, either through stance detection or semantic similarity. In addition to calculating factual accuracy, GenText can offer a layer of explainability for it, aiding users in understanding the reasoning behind the retrieval. Experimental evaluation of our model on benchmark datasets and against baseline models demonstrates its effectiveness in enhancing the retrieval of both topically relevant and factually accurate health information, thus presenting a significant step forward in the health misinformation mitigation problem.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Online Learning Efficiency Through Heterogeneous Resource Integration with a Multi-Agent RAG System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03948v1)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient online learning requires seamless access to diverse resources such as videos, code repositories, documentation, and general web content. This poster paper introduces early-stage work on a Multi-Agent Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System designed to enhance learning efficiency by integrating these heterogeneous resources. Using specialized agents tailored for specific resource types (e.g., YouTube tutorials, GitHub repositories, documentation websites, and search engines), the system automates the retrieval and synthesis of relevant information. By streamlining the process of finding and combining knowledge, this approach reduces manual effort and enhances the learning experience. A preliminary user study confirmed the system's strong usability and moderate-high utility, demonstrating its potential to improve the efficiency of knowledge acquisition.</p></details> |  |

While existing approaches such as ReAct maintain reasoning chains within the language model's context window, we observe that this often leads to plan fragmentation and execution failures. Our key insight is that by isolating the reasoning plan as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) outside the LM's working memory, we can enable (1) systematic exploration of reasoning paths, (2) atomic subqueries enabling precise retrievals and grounding, and (3) efficiency through parallel execution and bounded context window utilization. Moreover, Plan*RAG's modular design allows it to be integrated with existing RAG methods, thus providing a practical solution to improve current RAG systems. On standard multi-hop reasoning benchmarks, Plan*RAG consistently achieves improvements over recently proposed methods such as RQ-RAG and Self-RAG, while maintaining comparable computational costs.</p></details> | 19 pages, preprint |
| **[Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation: A Survey on Agentic RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09136v3)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized artificial intelligence (AI) by enabling human like text generation and natural language understanding. However, their reliance on static training data limits their ability to respond to dynamic, real time queries, resulting in outdated or inaccurate outputs. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a solution, enhancing LLMs by integrating real time data retrieval to provide contextually relevant and up-to-date responses. Despite its promise, traditional RAG systems are constrained by static workflows and lack the adaptability required for multistep reasoning and complex task management. Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Agentic RAG) transcends these limitations by embedding autonomous AI agents into the RAG pipeline. These agents leverage agentic design patterns reflection, planning, tool use, and multiagent collaboration to dynamically manage retrieval strategies, iteratively refine contextual understanding, and adapt workflows to meet complex task requirements. This integration enables Agentic RAG systems to deliver unparalleled flexibility, scalability, and context awareness across diverse applications. This survey provides a comprehensive exploration of Agentic RAG, beginning with its foundational principles and the evolution of RAG paradigms. It presents a detailed taxonomy of Agentic RAG architectures, highlights key applications in industries such as healthcare, finance, and education, and examines practical implementation strategies. Additionally, it addresses challenges in scaling these systems, ensuring ethical decision making, and optimizing performance for real-world applications, while providing detailed insights into frameworks and tools for implementing Agentic RAG.</p></details> |  |
| **[Addressing Hallucinations with RAG and NMISS in Italian Healthcare LLM Chatbots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04235v2)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>I combine detection and mitigation techniques to addresses hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs). Mitigation is achieved in a question-answering Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework while detection is obtained by introducing the Negative Missing Information Scoring System (NMISS), which accounts for contextual relevance in responses. While RAG mitigates hallucinations by grounding answers in external data, NMISS refines the evaluation by identifying cases where traditional metrics incorrectly flag contextually accurate responses as hallucinations. I use Italian health news articles as context to evaluate LLM performance. Results show that Gemma2 and GPT-4 outperform the other models, with GPT-4 producing answers closely aligned with reference responses. Mid-tier models, such as Llama2, Llama3, and Mistral benefit significantly from NMISS, highlighting their ability to provide richer contextual information. This combined approach offers new insights into the reduction and more accurate assessment of hallucinations in LLMs, with applications in real-world healthcare tasks and other domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging LLM Agents for Automated Optimization Modeling for SASP Problems: A Graph-RAG based Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18320v1)** | 2025-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated optimization modeling (AOM) has evoked considerable interest with the rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs). Existing approaches predominantly rely on prompt engineering, utilizing meticulously designed expert response chains or structured guidance. However, prompt-based techniques have failed to perform well in the sensor array signal processing (SASP) area due the lack of specific domain knowledge. To address this issue, we propose an automated modeling approach based on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) technique, which consists of two principal components: a multi-agent (MA) structure and a graph-based RAG (Graph-RAG) process. The MA structure is tailored for the architectural AOM process, with each agent being designed based on principles of human modeling procedure. The Graph-RAG process serves to match user query with specific SASP modeling knowledge, thereby enhancing the modeling result. Results on ten classical signal processing problems demonstrate that the proposed approach (termed as MAG-RAG) outperforms several AOM benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

Concepts such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and other advanced techniques have been developed to enhance these systems by integrating specific university data, enabling LLMs to provide informed responses on admissions and academic counseling. However, these enhanced RAG techniques often involve high operational costs and require the training of complex, specialized modules, which poses challenges for practical deployment. Additionally, in the educational context, it is crucial to provide accurate answers to prevent misinformation, a task that LLM-based systems find challenging without appropriate strategies and methods. In this paper, we introduce the Unified RAG (URAG) Framework, a hybrid approach that significantly improves the accuracy of responses, particularly for critical queries. Experimental results demonstrate that URAG enhances our in-house, lightweight model to perform comparably to state-of-the-art commercial models. Moreover, to validate its practical applicability, we conducted a case study at our educational institution, which received positive feedback and acclaim. This study not only proves the effectiveness of URAG but also highlights its feasibility for real-world implementation in educational settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review at SoICT'24</p></details> |

However, current benchmarks for evaluating RAG systems suffer from two key deficiencies: (1) they fail to adequately measure LLMs' capability in handling long-context retrieval due to a lack of datasets that reflect the characteristics of retrieved documents, and (2) they lack a comprehensive evaluation method for assessing LLMs' ability to generate long-form responses that effectively exploits retrieved information. To address these shortcomings, we introduce the Long$^2$RAG benchmark and the Key Point Recall (KPR) metric. Long$^2$RAG comprises 280 questions spanning 10 domains and across 8 question categories, each associated with 5 retrieved documents with an average length of 2,444 words. KPR evaluates the extent to which LLMs incorporate key points extracted from the retrieved documents into their generated responses, providing a more nuanced assessment of their ability to exploit retrieved information.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP'24 (Findings).

While it empowers individuals it also enables malicious actors to perpetrate scams such as fraudulent phone calls and user impersonations. This growing threat necessitates a robust system to protect individuals In this paper we introduce a novel real time fraud detection mechanism using Retrieval Augmented Generation technology to address this challenge on two fronts. First our system incorporates a continuously updating policy checking feature that transcribes phone calls in real time and uses RAG based models to verify that the caller is not soliciting private information thus ensuring transparency and the authenticity of the conversation. Second we implement a real time user impersonation check with a two step verification process to confirm the callers identity ensuring accountability. A key innovation of our system is the ability to update policies without retraining the entire model enhancing its adaptability. We validated our RAG based approach using synthetic call recordings achieving an accuracy of 97.98 percent and an F1score of 97.44 percent with 100 calls outperforming state of the art methods. This robust and flexible fraud detection system is well suited for real world deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[A RAG-Based Institutional Assistant](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13880v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong text generation capabilities, they struggle in scenarios requiring access to structured knowledge bases or specific documents, limiting their effectiveness in knowledge-intensive tasks. To address this limitation, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) models have been developed, enabling generative models to incorporate relevant document fragments into their inputs. In this paper, we design and evaluate a RAG-based virtual assistant specifically tailored for the University of S\~ao Paulo. Our system architecture comprises two key modules: a retriever and a generative model. We experiment with different types of models for both components, adjusting hyperparameters such as chunk size and the number of retrieved documents. Our optimal retriever model achieves a Top-5 accuracy of 30%, while our most effective generative model scores 22.04\% against ground truth answers. Notably, when the correct document chunks are supplied to the LLMs, accuracy significantly improves to 54.02%, an increase of over 30 percentage points. Conversely, without contextual input, performance declines to 13.68%. These findings highlight the critical role of database access in enhancing LLM performance. They also reveal the limitations of current semantic search methods in accurately identifying relevant documents and underscore the ongoing challenges LLMs face in generating precise responses.</p></details> |  |

However, LLMs are sensitive to the position of relevant information within contexts and tend to generate incorrect responses when such information is placed in the middle, known as `Lost in the Middle' phenomenon. In this paper, we introduce a framework that generates consistent outputs for decoder-only models, irrespective of the input context order. Experimental results for three open domain question answering tasks demonstrate position invariance, where the model is not sensitive to input context order, and superior robustness to irrelevent passages compared to prevailing approaches for RAG pipelines.</p></details> | 5 pages |

This study enhances interpretability in Chest X-ray (CXR) classification by using concept bottleneck models (CBMs) and a multi-agent Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for report generation. By modeling relationships between visual features and clinical concepts, we create interpretable concept vectors that guide a multi-agent RAG system to generate radiology reports, enhancing clinical relevance, explainability, and transparency. Evaluation of the generated reports using an LLM-as-a-judge confirmed the interpretability and clinical utility of our model's outputs. On the COVID-QU dataset, our model achieved 81% classification accuracy and demonstrated robust report generation performance, with five key metrics ranging between 84% and 90%. This interpretable multi-agent framework bridges the gap between high-performance AI and the explainability required for reliable AI-driven CXR analysis in clinical settings.

However, the integration of external documents into the generation process raises significant privacy concerns. Indeed, when added to a prompt, it is not possible to guarantee a response will not inadvertently expose confidential data, leading to potential breaches of privacy and ethical dilemmas. This paper explores a practical solution to this problem suitable to general knowledge extraction from personal data. It shows \emph{differentially private token generation} is a viable approach to private RAG.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generating Diverse Q&A Benchmarks for RAG Evaluation with DataMorgana](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12789v1)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, especially in domain-specific contexts, requires benchmarks that address the distinctive requirements of the applicative scenario. Since real data can be hard to obtain, a common strategy is to use LLM-based methods to generate synthetic data. Existing solutions are general purpose: given a document, they generate a question to build a Q&A pair. However, although the generated questions can be individually good, they are typically not diverse enough to reasonably cover the different ways real end-users can interact with the RAG system. We introduce here DataMorgana, a tool for generating highly customizable and diverse synthetic Q&A benchmarks tailored to RAG applications. DataMorgana enables detailed configurations of user and question categories and provides control over their distribution within the benchmark. It uses a lightweight two-stage process, ensuring efficiency and fast iterations, while generating benchmarks that reflect the expected traffic. We conduct a thorough line of experiments, showing quantitatively and qualitatively that DataMorgana surpasses existing tools and approaches in producing lexically, syntactically, and semantically diverse question sets across domain-specific and general-knowledge corpora. DataMorgana will be made available to selected teams in the research community, as first beta testers, in the context of the upcoming SIGIR'2025 LiveRAG challenge to be announced in early February 2025.</p></details> |  |
| **[Visual RAG: Expanding MLLM visual knowledge without fine-tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10834v1)** | 2025-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved notable performance in computer vision tasks that require reasoning across visual and textual modalities, yet their capabilities are limited to their pre-trained data, requiring extensive fine-tuning for updates. Recent researches have explored the use of In-Context Learning (ICL) to overcome these challenges by providing a set of demonstrating examples as context to augment MLLMs performance in several tasks, showing that many-shot ICL leads to substantial improvements compared to few-shot ICL. However, the reliance on numerous demonstrating examples and the limited MLLMs context windows presents significant obstacles. This paper aims to address these challenges by introducing a novel approach, Visual RAG, that synergically combines the MLLMs capability to learn from the context, with a retrieval mechanism. The crux of this approach is to ensure to augment the MLLM knowledge by selecting only the most relevant demonstrating examples for the query, pushing it to learn by analogy. In this way, relying on the new information provided dynamically during inference time, the resulting system is not limited to the knowledge extracted from the training data, but can be updated rapidly and easily without fine-tuning. Furthermore, this greatly reduces the computational costs for improving the model image classification performance, and augments the model knowledge to new visual domains and tasks it was not trained for. Extensive experiments on eight different datasets in the state of the art spanning several domains and image classification tasks show that the proposed Visual RAG, compared to the most recent state of the art (i.e., many-shot ICL), is able to obtain an accuracy that is very close or even higher (approx. +2% improvement on average) while using a much smaller set of demonstrating examples (approx. only 23% on average).</p></details> |  |
| **[4bit-Quantization in Vector-Embedding for RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10534v1)** | 2025-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a promising technique that has shown great potential in addressing some of the limitations of large language models (LLMs). LLMs have two major limitations: they can contain outdated information due to their training data, and they can generate factually inaccurate responses, a phenomenon known as hallucinations. RAG aims to mitigate these issues by leveraging a database of relevant documents, which are stored as embedding vectors in a high-dimensional space. However, one of the challenges of using high-dimensional embeddings is that they require a significant amount of memory to store. This can be a major issue, especially when dealing with large databases of documents. To alleviate this problem, we propose the use of 4-bit quantization to store the embedding vectors. This involves reducing the precision of the vectors from 32-bit floating-point numbers to 4-bit integers, which can significantly reduce the memory requirements. Our approach has several benefits. Firstly, it significantly reduces the memory storage requirements of the high-dimensional vector database, making it more feasible to deploy RAG systems in resource-constrained environments. Secondly, it speeds up the searching process, as the reduced precision of the vectors allows for faster computation. Our code is available at https://github.com/taeheej/4bit-Quantization-in-Vector-Embedding-for-RAG</p></details> |  |

However, how to make them reliable tools for some specific tasks such as automated short answer grading (ASAG) remains a challenge. We present SteLLA (Structured Grading System Using LLMs with RAG) in which a) Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approach is used to empower LLMs specifically on the ASAG task by extracting structured information from the highly relevant and reliable external knowledge based on the instructor-provided reference answer and rubric, b) an LLM performs a structured and question-answering-based evaluation of student answers to provide analytical grades and feedback. A real-world dataset that contains students' answers in an exam was collected from a college-level Biology course. Experiments show that our proposed system can achieve substantial agreement with the human grader while providing break-down grades and feedback on all the knowledge points examined in the problem. A qualitative and error analysis of the feedback generated by GPT4 shows that GPT4 is good at capturing facts while may be prone to inferring too much implication from the given text in the grading task which provides insights into the usage of LLMs in the ASAG system.</p></details> |  |

We propose the concept of the Sustainable AI Trilemma, highlighting the tensions between AI capability, digital equity, and environmental sustainability. Through a systematic case study of LLM agents and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), we analyze the energy costs embedded in memory module designs and introduce novel metrics to quantify the trade-offs between energy consumption and system performance. Our experimental results reveal significant energy inefficiencies in current memory-augmented frameworks and demonstrate that resource-constrained environments face disproportionate efficiency penalties. Our findings challenge the prevailing LLM-centric paradigm in agent design and provide practical insights for developing more sustainable AI systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[ASTRID -- An Automated and Scalable TRIaD for the Evaluation of RAG-based Clinical Question Answering Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08208v1)** | 2025-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive potential in clinical question answering (QA), with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) emerging as a leading approach for ensuring the factual accuracy of model responses. However, current automated RAG metrics perform poorly in clinical and conversational use cases. Using clinical human evaluations of responses is expensive, unscalable, and not conducive to the continuous iterative development of RAG systems. To address these challenges, we introduce ASTRID - an Automated and Scalable TRIaD for evaluating clinical QA systems leveraging RAG - consisting of three metrics: Context Relevance (CR), Refusal Accuracy (RA), and Conversational Faithfulness (CF). Our novel evaluation metric, CF, is designed to better capture the faithfulness of a model's response to the knowledge base without penalising conversational elements. To validate our triad, we curate a dataset of over 200 real-world patient questions posed to an LLM-based QA agent during surgical follow-up for cataract surgery - the highest volume operation in the world - augmented with clinician-selected questions for emergency, clinical, and non-clinical out-of-domain scenarios. We demonstrate that CF can predict human ratings of faithfulness better than existing definitions for conversational use cases. Furthermore, we show that evaluation using our triad consisting of CF, RA, and CR exhibits alignment with clinician assessment for inappropriate, harmful, or unhelpful responses. Finally, using nine different LLMs, we demonstrate that the three metrics can closely agree with human evaluations, highlighting the potential of these metrics for use in LLM-driven automated evaluation pipelines. We also publish the prompts and datasets for these experiments, providing valuable resources for further research and development.</p></details> | 29 pages |
| **[Research on the Online Update Method for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Model with Incremental Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07063v1)** | 2025-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the contemporary context of rapid advancements in information technology and the exponential growth of data volume, language models are confronted with significant challenges in effectively navigating the dynamic and ever-evolving information landscape to update and adapt to novel knowledge in real time. In this work, an online update method is proposed, which is based on the existing Retrieval Enhanced Generation (RAG) model with multiple innovation mechanisms. Firstly, the dynamic memory is used to capture the emerging data samples, and then gradually integrate them into the core model through a tunable knowledge distillation strategy. At the same time, hierarchical indexing and multi-layer gating mechanism are introduced into the retrieval module to ensure that the retrieved content is more targeted and accurate. Finally, a multi-stage network structure is established for different types of inputs in the generation stage, and cross-attention matching and screening are carried out on the intermediate representations of each stage to ensure the effective integration and iterative update of new and old knowledge. Experimental results show that the proposed method is better than the existing mainstream comparison models in terms of knowledge retention and inference accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[TrustRAG: Enhancing Robustness and Trustworthiness in RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00879v2)** | 2025-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enhance large language models (LLMs) by integrating external knowledge sources, enabling more accurate and contextually relevant responses tailored to user queries. However, these systems remain vulnerable to corpus poisoning attacks that can significantly degrade LLM performance through the injection of malicious content. To address these challenges, we propose TrustRAG, a robust framework that systematically filters compromised and irrelevant contents before they are retrieved for generation. Our approach implements a two-stage defense mechanism: At the first stage, it employs K-means clustering to identify potential attack patterns in retrieved documents using cosine similarity and ROUGE metrics as guidance, effectively isolating suspicious content. Secondly, it performs a self-assessment which detects malicious documents and resolves discrepancies between the model's internal knowledge and external information. TrustRAG functions as a plug-and-play, training-free module that integrates seamlessly with any language model, whether open or closed-source. In addition, TrustRAG maintains high contextual relevance while strengthening defenses against corpus poisoning attacks. Through extensive experimental validation, we demonstrate that TrustRAG delivers substantial improvements in retrieval accuracy, efficiency, and attack resistance compared to existing approaches across multiple model architectures and datasets. We have made TrustRAG available as open-source software at \url{https://github.com/HuichiZhou/TrustRAG}.</p></details> |  |
| **[First Token Probability Guided RAG for Telecom Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06468v1)** | 2025-01-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have garnered significant attention for their impressive general-purpose capabilities. For applications requiring intricate domain knowledge, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has shown a distinct advantage in incorporating domain-specific information into LLMs. However, existing RAG research has not fully addressed the challenges of Multiple Choice Question Answering (MCQA) in telecommunications, particularly in terms of retrieval quality and mitigating hallucinations. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel first token probability guided RAG framework. This framework leverages confidence scores to optimize key hyperparameters, such as chunk number and chunk window size, while dynamically adjusting the context. Our method starts by retrieving the most relevant chunks and generates a single token as the potential answer. The probabilities of all options are then normalized to serve as confidence scores, which guide the dynamic adjustment of the context. By iteratively optimizing the hyperparameters based on these confidence scores, we can continuously improve RAG performance. We conducted experiments to validate the effectiveness of our framework, demonstrating its potential to enhance accuracy in domain-specific MCQA tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLMQuoter: Enhancing RAG Capabilities Through Efficient Quote Extraction From Large Contexts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05554v1)** | 2025-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce LLMQuoter, a lightweight, distillation-based model designed to enhance Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) by extracting the most relevant textual evidence for downstream reasoning tasks. Built on the LLaMA-3B architecture and fine-tuned with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on a 15,000-sample subset of HotpotQA, LLMQuoter adopts a "quote-first-then-answer" strategy, efficiently identifying key quotes before passing curated snippets to reasoning models. This workflow reduces cognitive overhead and outperforms full-context approaches like Retrieval-Augmented Fine-Tuning (RAFT), achieving over 20-point accuracy gains across both small and large language models. By leveraging knowledge distillation from a high-performing teacher model, LLMQuoter achieves competitive results in a resource-efficient fine-tuning setup. It democratizes advanced RAG capabilities, delivering significant performance improvements without requiring extensive model retraining. Our results highlight the potential of distilled quote-based reasoning to streamline complex workflows, offering a scalable and practical solution for researchers and practitioners alike.</p></details> |  |

Previous RISE-based approaches for multi-agent systems required 2-hop communication, limiting practical applicability. New insights from a Lyapunov-based design-analysis approach are used to eliminate the need for multi-hop communication required in previous literature, while yielding exponential target tracking. The new insights include the development of a new P-function which is developed which works in tandem with the inclusion of the interaction matrix in the Lyapunov function. Nonsmooth Lyapunov-based stability analysis methods are used to yield semi-global exponential convergence to the target agent state despite the presence of bounded disturbances with bounded derivatives. The resulting outcome is a controller that achieves exponential target tracking with only local information exchange between neighboring agents.</p></details> | 6 pages, 1 figure |

While this description is crucial for distinguishing the target from visually similar instances in a scene, providing it prior to navigation can be demanding for human. To bridge this gap, we introduce Collaborative Instance object Navigation (CoIN), a new task setting where the agent actively resolve uncertainties about the target instance during navigation in natural, template-free, open-ended dialogues with human. We propose a novel training-free method, Agent-user Interaction with UncerTainty Awareness (AIUTA), which operates independently from the navigation policy, and focuses on the human-agent interaction reasoning with Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs). First, upon object detection, a Self-Questioner model initiates a self-dialogue within the agent to obtain a complete and accurate observation description with a novel uncertainty estimation technique. Then, an Interaction Trigger module determines whether to ask a question to the human, continue or halt navigation, minimizing user input. For evaluation, we introduce CoIN-Bench, with a curated dataset designed for challenging multi-instance scenarios. CoIN-Bench supports both online evaluation with humans and reproducible experiments with simulated user-agent interactions. On CoIN-Bench, we show that AIUTA serves as a competitive baseline, while existing language-driven instance navigation methods struggle in complex multi-instance scenes. Code and benchmark will be available upon acceptance at https://intelligolabs.github.io/CoIN/</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://intelligolabs.github.io/CoIN/</p></details> |

Although recent advancements have leveraged Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate refactoring tasks, current solutions are constrained in scope and lack mechanisms to guarantee code compilability and successful test execution. In this work, we introduce MANTRA, a comprehensive LLM agent-based framework that automates method-level refactoring. MANTRA integrates Context-Aware Retrieval-Augmented Generation, coordinated Multi-Agent Collaboration, and Verbal Reinforcement Learning to emulate human decision-making during refactoring while preserving code correctness and readability. Our empirical study, conducted on 703 instances of "pure refactorings" (i.e., code changes exclusively involving structural improvements), drawn from 10 representative Java projects, covers the six most prevalent refactoring operations. Experimental results demonstrate that MANTRA substantially surpasses a baseline LLM model (RawGPT ), achieving an 82.8% success rate (582/703) in producing code that compiles and passes all tests, compared to just 8.7% (61/703) with RawGPT. Moreover, in comparison to IntelliJ's LLM-powered refactoring tool (EM-Assist), MANTRA exhibits a 50% improvement in generating Extract Method transformations. A usability study involving 37 professional developers further shows that refactorings performed by MANTRA are perceived to be as readable and reusable as human-written code, and in certain cases, even more favorable. These results highlight the practical advantages of MANTRA and emphasize the growing potential of LLM-based systems in advancing the automation of software refactoring tasks.</p></details> | 10 pages |

In software engineering, LLM-powered coding agents have garnered significant attention due to their potential to automate complex development tasks, assist in debugging, and enhance productivity. However, existing approaches often struggle with sub-optimal decision-making, requiring either extensive manual intervention or inefficient compute scaling strategies. To improve coding agent performance, we present Dynamic Action Re-Sampling (DARS), a novel inference time compute scaling approach for coding agents, that is faster and more effective at recovering from sub-optimal decisions compared to baselines. While traditional agents either follow linear trajectories or rely on random sampling for scaling compute, our approach DARS works by branching out a trajectory at certain key decision points by taking an alternative action given the history of the trajectory and execution feedback of the previous attempt from that point. We evaluate our approach on SWE-Bench Lite benchmark, demonstrating that this scaling strategy achieves a pass@k score of 55% with Claude 3.5 Sonnet V2. Our framework achieves a pass@1 rate of 47%, outperforming state-of-the-art (SOTA) open-source frameworks.</p></details> |  |

Conversational agents can counteract these harmful dynamics by encouraging critical thinking. This study investigates how LLM-powered devil's advocate systems affect psychological safety, opinion expression, and satisfaction in power-imbalanced group dynamics. We conducted an experiment with 48 participants in 12 four-person groups, each containing three high-power (senior) and one low-power (junior) member. Each group completed decision tasks in both baseline and AI intervention conditions. Results show AI counterarguments fostered a more flexible atmosphere and significantly enhanced both process and outcome satisfaction for all participants, with particularly notable improvements for minority members. Cognitive workload increased slightly, though not significantly. This research contributes empirical evidence on how AI systems can effectively navigate power hierarchies to foster more inclusive decision-making environments, highlighting the importance of balancing intervention frequency, maintaining conversational flow, and preserving group cohesion.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 8 figures, 1 table, This is a preprint version of the Late Breaking Work accepted to CHI'25</p></details> |

Designed with GIS-like interaction and layered visualization, they often challenge non-expert users with complex functionalities and overlapping layers that obscure spatial relationships. We propose a GeoQA Portal using a multi-agent Large Language Model framework for seamless natural language interaction with geospatial data. Complex queries are broken into subtasks handled by specialized agents, retrieving relevant geographic data efficiently. Task plans are shown to users, boosting transparency. The portal supports default and custom data inputs for flexibility. Semantic search via word vector similarity aids data retrieval despite imperfect terms. Case studies, evaluations, and user tests confirm its effectiveness for non-experts, bridging GIS complexity and public access, and offering an intuitive solution for future geoportals.</p></details> |  |
| **[Decentralized Continuification Control of Multi-Agent Systems via Distributed Density Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14119v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a novel decentralized implementation of a continuification-based strategy to control the density of large-scale multi-agent systems on the unit circle. While continuification methods effectively address micro-to-macro control problems by reformulating ordinary/stochastic differential equations (ODEs/SDEs) agent-based models into more tractable partial differential equations (PDEs), they traditionally require centralized knowledge of macroscopic state observables. We overcome this limitation by developing a distributed density estimation framework that combines kernel density estimation with PI consensus dynamics. Our approach enables agents to compute local density estimates and derive local control actions using only information from neighboring agents in a communication network. Numerical validations across multiple scenarios - including regulation, tracking, and time-varying communication topologies - confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach. They also convincingly demonstrate that our decentralized implementation achieves performance comparable to centralized approaches while enhancing reliability and practical applicability.</p></details> |  |
| **[MDocAgent: A Multi-Modal Multi-Agent Framework for Document Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13964v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Document Question Answering (DocQA) is a very common task. Existing methods using Large Language Models (LLMs) or Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) often prioritize information from a single modal, failing to effectively integrate textual and visual cues. These approaches struggle with complex multi-modal reasoning, limiting their performance on real-world documents. We present MDocAgent (A Multi-Modal Multi-Agent Framework for Document Understanding), a novel RAG and multi-agent framework that leverages both text and image. Our system employs five specialized agents: a general agent, a critical agent, a text agent, an image agent and a summarizing agent. These agents engage in multi-modal context retrieval, combining their individual insights to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of the document's content. This collaborative approach enables the system to synthesize information from both textual and visual components, leading to improved accuracy in question answering. Preliminary experiments on five benchmarks like MMLongBench, LongDocURL demonstrate the effectiveness of our MDocAgent, achieve an average improvement of 12.1% compared to current state-of-the-art method. This work contributes to the development of more robust and comprehensive DocQA systems capable of handling the complexities of real-world documents containing rich textual and visual information. Our data and code are available at https://github.com/aiming-lab/MDocAgent.</p></details> |  |
| **[Benchmarking LLMs and LLM-based Agents in Practical Vulnerability Detection for Code Repositories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03586v2)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in software vulnerability detection, particularly on function-level benchmarks like Devign and BigVul. However, real-world detection requires interprocedural analysis, as vulnerabilities often emerge through multi-hop function calls rather than isolated functions. While repository-level benchmarks like ReposVul and VulEval introduce interprocedural context, they remain computationally expensive, lack pairwise evaluation of vulnerability fixes, and explore limited context retrieval, limiting their practicality. We introduce JitVul, a JIT vulnerability detection benchmark linking each function to its vulnerability-introducing and fixing commits. Built from 879 CVEs spanning 91 vulnerability types, JitVul enables comprehensive evaluation of detection capabilities. Our results show that ReAct Agents, leveraging thought-action-observation and interprocedural context, perform better than LLMs in distinguishing vulnerable from benign code. While prompting strategies like Chain-of-Thought help LLMs, ReAct Agents require further refinement. Both methods show inconsistencies, either misidentifying vulnerabilities or over-analyzing security guards, indicating significant room for improvement.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents SagaLLM, a structured multi-agent framework that addresses four fundamental limitations in current LLM approaches: inadequate self-validation, context narrowing, lacking transaction properties, and insufficient inter-agent coordination. By implementing specialized context management agents and validation protocols, SagaLLM preserves critical constraints and state information throughout complex planning processes, enabling robust and consistent decision-making even during disruptions. We evaluate our approach using selected problems from the REALM benchmark, focusing on sequential and reactive planning scenarios that challenge both context retention and adaptive reasoning. Our experiments with state-of-the-art LLMs, Claude 3.7, DeepSeek R1, GPT-4o, and GPT-o1, demonstrate that while these models exhibit impressive reasoning capabilities, they struggle with maintaining global constraint awareness during complex planning tasks, particularly when adapting to unexpected changes. In contrast, the distributed cognitive architecture of SagaLLM shows significant improvements in planning consistency, constraint enforcement, and adaptation to disruptions in various scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 8 tables, 5 figures</p></details> |

However, challenges remain in Multi-Disciplinary Team (MDT) medical consultations. Current research enhances reasoning through role assignment, task decomposition, and accumulation of medical experience. Multi-role collaboration in MDT consultations often results in excessively long dialogue histories. This increases the model's cognitive burden and degrades both efficiency and accuracy. Some methods only store treatment histories. They do not extract effective experience or reflect on errors. This limits knowledge generalization and system evolution. We propose a multi-agent MDT medical consultation framework based on LLMs to address these issues. Our framework uses consensus aggregation and a residual discussion structure for multi-round consultations. It also employs a Correct Answer Knowledge Base (CorrectKB) and a Chain-of-Thought Knowledge Base (ChainKB) to accumulate consultation experience. These mechanisms enable the framework to evolve and continually improve diagnosis rationality and accuracy. Experimental results on the MedQA and PubMedQA datasets demonstrate that our framework achieves accuracies of 90.1% and 83.9%, respectively, and that the constructed knowledge bases generalize effectively across test sets from both datasets.</p></details> | 24 pages |

This paper introduces WebNav, a voice-controlled web navigation agent that leverages a ReAct-inspired architecture and generative AI to provide this framework. WebNav comprises of a hierarchical structure: a Digital Navigation Module (DIGNAV) for high-level strategic planning, an Assistant Module for translating abstract commands into executable actions, and an Inference Module for low-level interaction. A key component is a dynamic labeling engine, implemented as a browser extension, that generates real-time labels for interactive elements, creating mapping between voice commands and Document Object Model (DOM) components. Preliminary evaluations show that WebNav outperforms traditional screen readers in response time and task completion accuracy for the visually impaired. Future work will focus on extensive user evaluations, benchmark development, and refining the agent's adaptive capabilities for real-world deployment.</p></details> |  |

Moreover, most existing methods neglect the crucial significance of LLMs utilizing external tools and model collaboration. To address these challenges, we introduce MAC-SQL, a novel LLM-based multi-agent collaborative framework. Our framework comprises a core decomposer agent for Text-to-SQL generation with few-shot chain-of-thought reasoning, accompanied by two auxiliary agents that utilize external tools or models to acquire smaller sub-databases and refine erroneous SQL queries. The decomposer agent collaborates with auxiliary agents, which are activated as needed and can be expanded to accommodate new features or tools for effective Text-to-SQL parsing. In our framework, We initially leverage GPT-4 as the strong backbone LLM for all agent tasks to determine the upper bound of our framework. We then fine-tune an open-sourced instruction-followed model, SQL-Llama, by leveraging Code Llama 7B, to accomplish all tasks as GPT-4 does. Experiments show that SQL-Llama achieves a comparable execution accuracy of 43.94, compared to the baseline accuracy of 46.35 for vanilla GPT-4. At the time of writing, MAC-SQL+GPT-4 achieves an execution accuracy of 59.59 when evaluated on the BIRD benchmark, establishing a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) on its holdout test set (https://github.com/wbbeyourself/MAC-SQL).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by COLING 2025 (Oral)</p></details> |

These include autonomous vehicles and other agents' applications in business processes and problem-solving. For networks, the increasing scale and operation and management (O&M) complexity drive the need for autonomous networks (AN). The technical objective of AN is to ensure trustworthy O&M without human intervention for higher efficiency and lower operating costs. However, realizing AN seems more difficult than autonomous vehicles. It encounters challenges of networks' structural and functional complexity, which operate as distributed dynamic systems governed by various technical and economic constraints. A key problem lies in formulating a rigorous development methodology that facilitates a seamless transition from traditional networks to AN. Central to this methodology is the definition of a reference architecture for network agents, which specifies the required functionalities for their realization, regardless of implementation choices. This article proposes a reference architecture characterizing main functional features, illustrating its application with network use cases. It shows how artificial intelligence components can be used to implement the required functionality and its coordination. The latter is achieved through the management and generation of shared domain-specific knowledge stored in long-term memory, ensuring the overall consistency of decisions and their execution. The article concludes with a discussion of architecture specialization for building network layer agents. It also identifies the main technical challenges ahead, such as satisfying essential requirements at development or runtime, as well as the issue of coordinating agents to achieve collective intelligence in meeting overall network goals.</p></details> |  |

Preference-based RL mitigates some of these pitfalls by learning rewards from comparative feedback rather than hand-crafted signals, yet scaling human annotations remains challenging. Recent work uses Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to automate preference labeling, but a single final-state image generally fails to capture the agent's full motion. In this paper, we present a two-part solution that both improves feedback accuracy and better aligns reward learning with the agent's policy. First, we overlay trajectory sketches on final observations to reveal the path taken, allowing VLMs to provide more reliable preferences-improving preference accuracy by approximately 15-20% in metaworld tasks. Second, we regularize reward learning by incorporating the agent's performance, ensuring that the reward model is optimized based on data generated by the current policy; this addition boosts episode returns by 20-30% in locomotion tasks. Empirical studies on metaworld demonstrate that our method achieves, for instance, around 70-80% success rate in all tasks, compared to below 50% for standard approaches. These results underscore the efficacy of combining richer visual representations with agent-aware reward regularization.</p></details> | 8 pages |

Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) offers adaptive solutions, but online MARL requires extensive interactions with the environment, making it costly and impractical. Offline MARL mitigates these challenges by using historical traffic data for training but faces significant difficulties with heterogeneous behavior policies in real-world datasets, where mixed-quality data complicates learning. We introduce OffLight, a novel offline MARL framework designed to handle heterogeneous behavior policies in TSC datasets. To improve learning efficiency, OffLight incorporates Importance Sampling (IS) to correct for distributional shifts and Return-Based Prioritized Sampling (RBPS) to focus on high-quality experiences. OffLight utilizes a Gaussian Mixture Variational Graph Autoencoder (GMM-VGAE) to capture the diverse distribution of behavior policies from local observations. Extensive experiments across real-world urban traffic scenarios show that OffLight outperforms existing offline RL methods, achieving up to a 7.8% reduction in average travel time and 11.2% decrease in queue length. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of OffLight's components in handling heterogeneous data and improving policy performance. These results highlight OffLight's scalability and potential to improve urban traffic management without the risks of online learning.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce the concept of \textbf{Orchestrated Distributed Intelligence (ODI)}, a novel paradigm that reconceptualizes AI not as isolated autonomous agents, but as cohesive, orchestrated networks that work in tandem with human expertise. ODI leverages advanced orchestration layers, multi-loop feedback mechanisms, and a high cognitive density framework to transform static, record-keeping systems into dynamic, action-oriented environments. Through a comprehensive review of multi-agent system literature, recent technological advances, and practical insights from industry forums, we argue that the future of AI lies in integrating distributed intelligence within human-centric workflows. This approach not only enhances operational efficiency and strategic agility but also addresses challenges related to scalability, transparency, and ethical decision-making. Our work outlines key theoretical implications and presents a practical roadmap for future research and enterprise innovation, aiming to pave the way for responsible and adaptive AI systems that drive sustainable innovation in human organizations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Why Do Multi-Agent LLM Systems Fail?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13657v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite growing enthusiasm for Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), where multiple LLM agents collaborate to accomplish tasks, their performance gains across popular benchmarks remain minimal compared to single-agent frameworks. This gap highlights the need to analyze the challenges hindering MAS effectiveness. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study of MAS challenges. We analyze five popular MAS frameworks across over 150 tasks, involving six expert human annotators. We identify 14 unique failure modes and propose a comprehensive taxonomy applicable to various MAS frameworks. This taxonomy emerges iteratively from agreements among three expert annotators per study, achieving a Cohen's Kappa score of 0.88. These fine-grained failure modes are organized into 3 categories, (i) specification and system design failures, (ii) inter-agent misalignment, and (iii) task verification and termination. To support scalable evaluation, we integrate MASFT with LLM-as-a-Judge. We also explore if identified failures could be easily prevented by proposing two interventions: improved specification of agent roles and enhanced orchestration strategies. Our findings reveal that identified failures require more complex solutions, highlighting a clear roadmap for future research. We open-source our dataset and LLM annotator.</p></details> |  |

An important characteristic of these stable-matching problems is the very arbitrary specification of the task subsets constituting "feasible" allocations for each agent. It is shown that as long as the agents rank their feasible task allocations lexicographically with respect to their stated preferences for each atomic task, matching stability reduces to the absence of blocking agent-task pairs. This result, together with a pertinent graphical representation of feasible allocations, enable (i) the representation of the space of stable matchings as a set of linear constraints with binary variables, and (ii) the specification and handling of certain notions of optimality within this space of stable matchings. The last part of the paper also addresses the notion of "substitutability" in the considered problem context.</p></details> |  |

Large-scale domains such as legal codes or frequently updated funding opportunities render human annotation (e.g., web forms or decision trees) impractical, highlighting the need for agents that can automatically assist in decision-making. Since relevant information is often only known to the user, it is crucial that these agents ask the right questions. As agents determine when to terminate a conversation, they face a trade-off between accuracy and the number of questions asked, a key metric for both user experience and cost. To evaluate this task, we propose BeNYfits, a new benchmark for determining user eligibility for multiple overlapping social benefits opportunities through interactive decision-making. Our experiments show that current language models struggle with frequent hallucinations, with GPT-4o scoring only 35.7 F1 using a ReAct-style chain-of-thought. To address this, we introduce ProADA, a novel approach that leverages program synthesis to assist in decision-making by mapping dialog planning to a code generation problem and using gaps in structured data to determine the best next action. Our agent, ProADA, improves the F1 score to 55.6 while maintaining nearly the same number of dialog turns.</p></details> |  |

Despite significant breakthroughs in reasoning capabilities within Large Language Models, multi-modal reasoning - especially for videos - remains unexplored. In this work, we introduce VideoMind, a novel video-language agent designed for temporal-grounded video understanding. VideoMind incorporates two key innovations: (i) We identify essential capabilities for video temporal reasoning and develop a role-based agentic workflow, including a planner for coordinating different roles, a grounder for temporal localization, a verifier to assess temporal interval accuracy, and an answerer for question-answering. (ii) To efficiently integrate these diverse roles, we propose a novel Chain-of-LoRA strategy, enabling seamless role-switching via lightweight LoRA adaptors while avoiding the overhead of multiple models, thus balancing efficiency and flexibility. Extensive experiments on 14 public benchmarks demonstrate that our agent achieves state-of-the-art performance on diverse video understanding tasks, including 3 on grounded video question-answering, 6 on video temporal grounding, and 5 on general video question-answering, underscoring its effectiveness in advancing video agent and long-form temporal reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://videomind.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[A Comprehensive Survey on Multi-Agent Cooperative Decision-Making: Scenarios, Approaches, Challenges and Perspectives](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13415v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid development of artificial intelligence, intelligent decision-making techniques have gradually surpassed human levels in various human-machine competitions, especially in complex multi-agent cooperative task scenarios. Multi-agent cooperative decision-making involves multiple agents working together to complete established tasks and achieve specific objectives. These techniques are widely applicable in real-world scenarios such as autonomous driving, drone navigation, disaster rescue, and simulated military confrontations. This paper begins with a comprehensive survey of the leading simulation environments and platforms used for multi-agent cooperative decision-making. Specifically, we provide an in-depth analysis for these simulation environments from various perspectives, including task formats, reward allocation, and the underlying technologies employed. Subsequently, we provide a comprehensive overview of the mainstream intelligent decision-making approaches, algorithms and models for multi-agent systems (MAS). Theseapproaches can be broadly categorized into five types: rule-based (primarily fuzzy logic), game theory-based, evolutionary algorithms-based, deep multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)-based, and large language models(LLMs)reasoning-based. Given the significant advantages of MARL andLLMs-baseddecision-making methods over the traditional rule, game theory, and evolutionary algorithms, this paper focuses on these multi-agent methods utilizing MARL and LLMs-based techniques. We provide an in-depth discussion of these approaches, highlighting their methodology taxonomies, advantages, and drawbacks. Further, several prominent research directions in the future and potential challenges of multi-agent cooperative decision-making are also detailed.</p></details> | 54 pages, 24 figures |

This paper introduces an innovative approach\footnote{A lightweight, mock version of the code is available on GitHub at that combines a multi-agent framework with the Network Simulator 3 (ns-3) to automate and optimize the generation, debugging, execution, and analysis of complex 5G network scenarios. Our framework orchestrates a suite of specialized agents -- namely, the Simulation Generation Agent, Test Designer Agent, Test Executor Agent, and Result Interpretation Agent -- using advanced LangChain coordination. The Simulation Generation Agent employs a structured chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning process, leveraging LLMs and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to translate natural language simulation specifications into precise ns-3 scripts. Concurrently, the Test Designer Agent generates comprehensive automated test suites by integrating knowledge retrieval techniques with dynamic test case synthesis. The Test Executor Agent dynamically deploys and runs simulations, managing dependencies and parsing detailed performance metrics. At the same time, the Result Interpretation Agent utilizes LLM-driven analysis to extract actionable insights from the simulation outputs. By integrating external resources such as library documentation and ns-3 testing frameworks, our experimental approach can enhance simulation accuracy and adaptability, reducing reliance on extensive programming expertise. A detailed case study using the ns-3 5G-LENA module validates the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The code generation process converges in an average of 1.8 iterations, has a syntax error rate of 17.0%, a mean response time of 7.3 seconds, and receives a human evaluation score of 7.5.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[Agents Play Thousands of 3D Video Games](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13356v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present PORTAL, a novel framework for developing artificial intelligence agents capable of playing thousands of 3D video games through language-guided policy generation. By transforming decision-making problems into language modeling tasks, our approach leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate behavior trees represented in domain-specific language (DSL). This method eliminates the computational burden associated with traditional reinforcement learning approaches while preserving strategic depth and rapid adaptability. Our framework introduces a hybrid policy structure that combines rule-based nodes with neural network components, enabling both high-level strategic reasoning and precise low-level control. A dual-feedback mechanism incorporating quantitative game metrics and vision-language model analysis facilitates iterative policy improvement at both tactical and strategic levels. The resulting policies are instantaneously deployable, human-interpretable, and capable of generalizing across diverse gaming environments. Experimental results demonstrate PORTAL's effectiveness across thousands of first-person shooter (FPS) games, showcasing significant improvements in development efficiency, policy generalization, and behavior diversity compared to traditional approaches. PORTAL represents a significant advancement in game AI development, offering a practical solution for creating sophisticated agents that can operate across thousands of commercial video games with minimal development overhead.

| **[Goal2Story: A Multi-Agent Fleet based on Privately Enabled sLLMs for Impacting Mapping on Requirements Elicitation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13279v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As requirements drift with rapid iterations, agile development becomes the dominant paradigm. Goal-driven Requirements Elicitation (RE) is a pivotal yet challenging task in agile project development due to its heavy tangling with adaptive planning and efficient collaboration. Recently, AI agents have shown promising ability in supporting requirements analysis by saving significant time and effort for stakeholders. However, current research mainly focuses on functional RE, and research works have not been reported bridging the long journey from goal to user stories. Moreover, considering the cost of LLM facilities and the need for data and idea protection, privately hosted small-sized LLM should be further utilized in RE. To address these challenges, we propose Goal2Story, a multi-agent fleet that adopts the Impact Mapping (IM) framework while merely using cost-effective sLLMs for goal-driven RE. Moreover, we introduce a StorySeek dataset that contains over 1,000 user stories (USs) with corresponding goals and project context information, as well as the semi-automatic dataset construction method. For evaluation, we proposed two metrics: Factuality Hit Rate (FHR) to measure consistency between the generated USs with the dataset and Quality And Consistency Evaluation (QuACE) to evaluate the quality of the generated USs. Experimental results demonstrate that Goal2Story outperforms the baseline performance of the Super-Agent adopting powerful LLMs, while also showcasing the performance improvements in key metrics brought by CoT and Agent Profile to Goal2Story, as well as its exploration in identifying latent needs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Knowledge-Aware Iterative Retrieval for Multi-Agent Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13275v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a novel large language model (LLM)-driven agent framework, which iteratively refines queries and filters contextual evidence by leveraging dynamically evolving knowledge. A defining feature of the system is its decoupling of external sources from an internal knowledge cache that is progressively updated to guide both query generation and evidence selection. This design mitigates bias-reinforcement loops and enables dynamic, trackable search exploration paths, thereby optimizing the trade-off between exploring diverse information and maintaining accuracy through autonomous agent decision-making. Our approach is evaluated on a broad range of open-domain question answering benchmarks, including multi-step tasks that mirror real-world scenarios where integrating information from multiple sources is critical, especially given the vulnerabilities of LLMs that lack explicit reasoning or planning capabilities. The results show that the proposed system not only outperforms single-step baselines regardless of task difficulty but also, compared to conventional iterative retrieval methods, demonstrates pronounced advantages in complex tasks through precise evidence-based reasoning and enhanced efficiency. The proposed system supports both competitive and collaborative sharing of updated context, enabling multi-agent extension. The benefits of multi-agent configurations become especially prominent as task difficulty increases. The number of convergence steps scales with task difficulty, suggesting cost-effective scalability.</p></details> |  |
| **[DAgent: A Relational Database-Driven Data Analysis Report Generation Agent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13269v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Relational database-driven data analysis (RDB-DA) report generation, which aims to generate data analysis reports after querying relational databases, has been widely applied in fields such as finance and healthcare. Typically, these tasks are manually completed by data scientists, making the process very labor-intensive and showing a clear need for automation. Although existing methods (e.g., Table QA or Text-to-SQL) have been proposed to reduce human dependency, they cannot handle complex analytical tasks that require multi-step reasoning, cross-table associations, and synthesizing insights into reports. Moreover, there is no dataset available for developing automatic RDB-DA report generation. To fill this gap, this paper proposes an LLM agent system for RDB-DA report generation tasks, dubbed DAgent; moreover, we construct a benchmark for automatic data analysis report generation, which includes a new dataset DA-Dataset and evaluation metrics. DAgent integrates planning, tools, and memory modules to decompose natural language questions into logically independent sub-queries, accurately retrieve key information from relational databases, and generate analytical reports that meet the requirements of completeness, correctness, and conciseness through multi-step reasoning and effective data integration. Experimental analysis on the DA-Dataset demonstrates that DAgent's superiority in retrieval performance and analysis report generation quality, showcasing its strong potential for tackling complex database analysis report generation tasks.</p></details> |  |

We design a framework to orchestrate agents under realistic conditions, such as inference costs or availability constraints. We show theoretically that orchestration is only effective if there are performance or cost differentials between agents. We then empirically demonstrate how orchestration between multiple agents can be helpful for selecting agents in a simulated environment, picking a learning strategy in the infamous Rogers' Paradox from social science, and outsourcing tasks to other agents during a question-answer task in a user study.</p></details> |  |
| **[MAP: Evaluation and Multi-Agent Enhancement of Large Language Models for Inpatient Pathways](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13205v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inpatient pathways demand complex clinical decision-making based on comprehensive patient information, posing critical challenges for clinicians. Despite advancements in large language models (LLMs) in medical applications, limited research focused on artificial intelligence (AI) inpatient pathways systems, due to the lack of large-scale inpatient datasets. Moreover, existing medical benchmarks typically concentrated on medical question-answering and examinations, ignoring the multifaceted nature of clinical decision-making in inpatient settings. To address these gaps, we first developed the Inpatient Pathway Decision Support (IPDS) benchmark from the MIMIC-IV database, encompassing 51,274 cases across nine triage departments and 17 major disease categories alongside 16 standardized treatment options. Then, we proposed the Multi-Agent Inpatient Pathways (MAP) framework to accomplish inpatient pathways with three clinical agents, including a triage agent managing the patient admission, a diagnosis agent serving as the primary decision maker at the department, and a treatment agent providing treatment plans. Additionally, our MAP framework includes a chief agent overseeing the inpatient pathways to guide and promote these three clinician agents. Extensive experiments showed our MAP improved the diagnosis accuracy by 25.10% compared to the state-of-the-art LLM HuatuoGPT2-13B. It is worth noting that our MAP demonstrated significant clinical compliance, outperforming three board-certified clinicians by 10%-12%, establishing a foundation for inpatient pathways systems.</p></details> |  |

A living organism is a prime example of such an agent, offering important lessons about adaptive autonomy. Here, we focus on interoception, a process of monitoring one's internal environment to keep it within certain bounds, which underwrites the survival of an organism. To develop AI with interoception, we need to factorize the state variables representing internal environments from external environments and adopt life-inspired mathematical properties of internal environment states. This paper offers a new perspective on how interoception can help build autonomous and adaptive agents by integrating the legacy of cybernetics with recent advances in theories of life, reinforcement learning, and neuroscience.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 3 figures, 2 boxes</p></details> |
| **[A representational framework for learning and encoding structurally enriched trajectories in complex agent environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13194v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ability of artificial intelligence agents to make optimal decisions and generalise them to different domains and tasks is compromised in complex scenarios. One way to address this issue has focused on learning efficient representations of the world and on how the actions of agents affect them, such as disentangled representations that exploit symmetries. Whereas such representations are procedurally efficient, they are based on the compression of low-level state-action transitions, which lack structural richness. To address this problem, we propose to enrich the agent's ontology and extend the traditional conceptualisation of trajectories to provide a more nuanced view of task execution. Structurally Enriched Trajectories (SETs) extend the encoding of sequences of states and their transitions by incorporating hierarchical relations between objects, interactions and affordances. SETs are built as multi-level graphs, providing a detailed representation of the agent dynamics and a transferable functional abstraction of the task. SETs are integrated into an architecture, Structurally Enriched Trajectory Learning and Encoding (SETLE), that employs a heterogeneous graph-based memory structure of multi-level relational dependencies essential for generalisation. Using reinforcement learning as a data generation tool, we demonstrate that SETLE can support downstream tasks, enabling agents to recognise task-relevant structural patterns across diverse environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prioritized Planning for Continuous-time Lifelong Multi-agent Pathfinding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13175v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent Path Finding (MAPF) is the problem of planning collision-free movements of agents such that they get from where they are to where they need to be. Commonly, agents are located on a graph and can traverse edges. This problem has many variations and has been studied for decades. Two such variations are the continuous-time and the lifelong MAPF problems. In the continuous-time MAPF problem, edges can have non-unit lengths and agents can traverse them at any real-valued time. Additionally, agent volumes are often included. In the lifelong MAPF problem, agents must attend to a continuous stream of incoming tasks. Much work has been devoted to designing solution methods within these two areas. However, to our knowledge, the combined problem of continuous-time lifelong MAPF has yet to be addressed. This work addresses continuous-time lifelong MAPF with agent volumes by presenting the fast and sub-optimal Continuous-time Prioritized Lifelong Planner (CPLP). CPLP continuously re-prioritizes tasks, assigns agents to them, and computes agent plans using a combination of two path planners; one based on CCBS and the other on SIPP. Experimental results with up to $400$ agents on graphs with $4000$ vertices demonstrate average computation times below $20$ ms per call. In online settings where available time to compute plans is limited, CPLP ensures collision-free movement even when failing to meet these time limits. Therefore, the robustness of CPLP highlights its potential for real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

When such systems implement a conversational component to interact with the users, they are also known as conversational agents. Bots, particularly in their conversation-oriented version and AI-powered, have seen their adoption increase over time for software development and engineering purposes. Despite their exciting potential, ulteriorly enhanced by the advent of Generative AI and Large Language Models, bots still need to be improved to develop and integrate into the development cycle since practitioners report that bots add additional challenges that may worsen rather than improve. In this work, we aim to provide a taxonomy for characterizing bots, as well as a series of challenges for their adoption for Software Engineering associated with potential mitigation strategies. To reach our objectives, we conducted a multivocal literature review, reviewing both research and practitioner's literature. Through such an approach, we hope to contribute to both researchers and practitioners by providing first, a series of future research routes to follow, second, a list of strategies to adopt for improving the use of bots for software engineering purposes, and third, enforce a technology and knowledge transfer from the research field to the practitioners one, that is one of the primary goal of multivocal literature reviews.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Better Sample Efficiency in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning via Exploration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13077v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent reinforcement learning has shown promise in learning cooperative behaviors in team-based environments. However, such methods often demand extensive training time. For instance, the state-of-the-art method TiZero takes 40 days to train high-quality policies for a football environment. In this paper, we hypothesize that better exploration mechanisms can improve the sample efficiency of multi-agent methods. We propose two different approaches for better exploration in TiZero: a self-supervised intrinsic reward and a random network distillation bonus. Additionally, we introduce architectural modifications to the original algorithm to enhance TiZero's computational efficiency. We evaluate the sample efficiency of these approaches through extensive experiments. Our results show that random network distillation improves training sample efficiency by 18.8% compared to the original TiZero. Furthermore, we evaluate the qualitative behavior of the models produced by both variants against a heuristic AI, with the self-supervised reward encouraging possession and random network distillation leading to a more offensive performance. Our results highlights the applicability of our random network distillation variant in practical settings. Lastly, due to the nature of the proposed method, we acknowledge its use beyond football simulation, especially in environments with strong multi-agent and strategic aspects.</p></details> | 8 pages, 3 figures |

To this end, we define a real-time extension of MAS graphs, extend the abstraction procedure, and prove its correctness for the universal fragment of Timed Computation Tree Logic (TCTL). Besides estimating the theoretical complexity gains, we present an experimental evaluation for a simplified model of the Estonian voting system and verification using the Uppaal model checker.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we focus on the fine-grained behavior of fast-moving real robots and present a large-scale experimental study involving \numepisodes{} navigation episodes in a real environment with a physical robot, where we analyze the type of reasoning emerging from end-to-end training. In particular, we study the presence of realistic dynamics which the agent learned for open-loop forecasting, and their interplay with sensing. We analyze the way the agent uses latent memory to hold elements of the scene structure and information gathered during exploration. We probe the planning capabilities of the agent, and find in its memory evidence for somewhat precise plans over a limited horizon. Furthermore, we show in a post-hoc analysis that the value function learned by the agent relates to long-term planning. Put together, our experiments paint a new picture on how using tools from computer vision and sequential decision making have led to new capabilities in robotics and control.

While many specialized and all-in-one IR models have been developed, they fail to effectively handle complex, mixed degradations. Recent agentic methods RestoreAgent and AgenticIR leverage intelligent, autonomous workflows to alleviate this issue, yet they suffer from suboptimal results and inefficiency due to their resource-intensive finetunings, and ineffective searches and tool execution trials for satisfactory outputs. In this paper, we propose MAIR, a novel Multi-Agent approach for complex IR problems. We introduce a real-world degradation prior, categorizing degradations into three types: (1) scene, (2) imaging, and (3) compression, which are observed to occur sequentially in real world, and reverse them in the opposite order. Built upon this three-stage restoration framework, MAIR emulates a team of collaborative human specialists, including a "scheduler" for overall planning and multiple "experts" dedicated to specific degradations. This design minimizes search space and trial efforts, improving image quality while reducing inference costs. In addition, a registry mechanism is introduced to enable easy integration of new tools. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that proposed MAIR achieves competitive performance and improved efficiency over the previous agentic IR system. Code and models will be made available.</p></details> |  |

However, video-to-audio dubbing for long-form content remains an unsolved challenge due to dynamic semantic shifts, temporal misalignment, and the absence of dedicated datasets. While existing methods excel in short videos, they falter in long scenarios (e.g., movies) due to fragmented synthesis and inadequate cross-scene consistency. We propose LVAS-Agent, a novel multi-agent framework that emulates professional dubbing workflows through collaborative role specialization. Our approach decomposes long-video synthesis into four steps including scene segmentation, script generation, sound design and audio synthesis. Central innovations include a discussion-correction mechanism for scene/script refinement and a generation-retrieval loop for temporal-semantic alignment. To enable systematic evaluation, we introduce LVAS-Bench, the first benchmark with 207 professionally curated long videos spanning diverse scenarios. Experiments demonstrate superior audio-visual alignment over baseline methods. Project page: https://lvas-agent.github.io</p></details> |  |

(2023) [01], the large language model GPT demonstrated economic rationality comparable to or exceeding the average human level in tasks such as budget allocation and risk preference. Building on this finding, this paper further incorporates specialized agents, such as biotechnology experts and economists, for a horizontal comparison to explore whether specialization can enhance or maintain economic rationality equivalent to that of GPT in similar decision-making scenarios. The results indicate that when agents invest more effort in specialized fields, their decision-making behavior is more prone to 'rationality shift,' specifically manifested as increased violations of GARP (Generalized Axiom of Revealed Preference), decreased CCEI (Critical Cost Efficiency Index), and more significant decision deviations under high-risk conditions. In contrast, GPT and more generalized basic agents maintain a more stable and consistent level of rationality across multiple tasks. This study reveals the inherent conflict between specialization and economic rationality, providing new insights for constructing AI decision-making systems that balance specialization and generalization across various scenarios.</p></details> |  |

By delegating subtasks to specialized agents, MAP (1) retrieves and reflects on relevant user information, while enhancing reliability through agent-to-agent interactions, (2) provides detailed analysis for improved transparency and usability, and (3) integrates user feedback to iteratively refine results. Our user study findings (n=12) highlight MAP's effectiveness and usability for conflict resolution while emphasizing the importance of user involvement in resolution verification and failure management.

Existing methods such as agent-based modeling (ABM) and empirical measurements fail to account for individual physiological variations and environmental perception mechanisms under thermal stress. This results in a lack of human-centred, heat-adaptive routing suggestions. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Vision Language Model (VLM)-driven Persona-Perception-Planning-Memory (PPPM) framework that integrating street view imagery and urban network topology to simulate heat-adaptive pedestrian routing. Through structured prompt engineering on Gemini-2.0 model, eight distinct heat-sensitive personas were created to model mobility behaviors during heat exposure, with empirical validation through questionnaire survey. Results demonstrate that simulation outputs effectively capture inter-persona variations, achieving high significant congruence with observed route preferences and highlighting differences in the factors driving agents decisions. Our framework is highly cost-effective, with simulations costing 0.006USD and taking 47.81s per route. This Artificial Intelligence-Generated Content (AIGC) methodology advances urban climate adaptation research by enabling high-resolution simulation of thermal-responsive mobility patterns, providing actionable insights for climate-resilient urban planning.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures |

An Agentic HLS Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12721v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent Large Language Models (LLMs) such as OpenAI o3-mini and DeepSeek-R1 use enhanced reasoning through Chain-of-Thought (CoT). Their potential in hardware design, which relies on expert-driven iterative optimization, remains unexplored. This paper investigates whether reasoning LLMs can address challenges in High-Level Synthesis (HLS) design space exploration and optimization. During HLS, engineers manually define pragmas/directives to balance performance and resource constraints. We propose an LLM-based optimization agentic framework that automatically restructures code, inserts pragmas, and identifies optimal design points via feedback from HLs tools and access to integer-linear programming (ILP) solvers. Experiments compare reasoning models against conventional LLMs on benchmarks using success rate, efficiency, and design quality (area/latency) metrics, and provide the first-ever glimpse into the CoTs produced by a powerful open-source reasoning model like DeepSeek-R1.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, submitted for peer review</p></details> |

Inspired by the neural scaling law--increasing neurons enhances performance, this study explores whether the continuous addition of collaborative agents can yield similar benefits. Technically, we utilize directed acyclic graphs to organize agents into a multi-agent collaboration network (MacNet), upon which their interactive reasoning is topologically orchestrated for autonomous task solving. Extensive evaluations reveal that it effectively supports collaboration among over a thousand agents, with irregular topologies outperforming regular ones. We also identify a collaborative scaling law--the overall performance follows a logistic growth pattern as agents scale, with collaborative emergence occurring earlier than traditional neural emergence. We speculate this may be because scaling agents catalyzes their multidimensional considerations during interactive reflection and refinement, thereby producing more comprehensive artifacts.

This article considers two approaches, first enumerating the characteristics observed in these three IoT application types and then modeling an UAV's battery recharge coordination using the Agent-Based Simulation (ABS) approach. In this way, we propose that each drone inside the swarm does not communicate concerning this recharge coordination decision, reducing energy usage and permitting remote usage. A total of 6000 simulations were run to evaluate how two proposed policies, the BaseLine (BL) and ChargerThershold (CT) coordination recharging policy, behave in 30 situations regarding how each simulation sets conclude the simulation runs and how much time they work until recharging results. CT policy shows more reliable results in extreme system usage. This work conclusion presents the potential of these three IoT applications to achieve their perpetual service without communication between drones and ground stations. This work can be a baseline for future policies and simulation parameter enhancements.</p></details> | 22 pages |
| **[On Some Fundamental Problems for Multi-Agent Systems Over Multilayer Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12684v1)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many researchers have considered multi-agent systems over single-layer networks as models for studying diffusion phenomena. Since real-world networks involve connections between agents with different semantics (e.g., family member, friend, colleague), the study of multi-agent systems over multilayer networks has assumed importance. Our focus is on one class of multi-agent system models over multilayer networks, namely multilayer synchronous dynamical systems (MSyDSs). We study several fundamental problems for this model. We establish properties of the phase spaces of MSyDSs and bring out interesting differences between single-layer and multilayer dynamical systems. We show that, in general, the problem of determining whether two given MSyDSs are inequivalent is NP-complete. This hardness result holds even when the only difference between the two systems is the local function at just one node in one layer. We also present efficient algorithms for the equivalence problem for restricted versions of MSyDSs (e.g., systems where each local function is a bounded-threshold function, systems where the number of layers is fixed and each local function is symmetric). In addition, we investigate the expressive power of MSyDSs based on the number of layers. In particular, we examine conditions under which a system with k >= 2 layers has an equivalent system with k-1 or fewer layers.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is a complete version of the paper (with the same title) that will appear in Proc. of the 24th International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multi-agent Systems (AAMAS 2025), Detroit, MI, May 2025</p></details> |
| **[VeriLA: A Human-Centered Evaluation Framework for Interpretable Verification of LLM Agent Failures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12651v1)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI practitioners increasingly use large language model (LLM) agents in compound AI systems to solve complex reasoning tasks, these agent executions often fail to meet human standards, leading to errors that compromise the system's overall performance. Addressing these failures through human intervention is challenging due to the agents' opaque reasoning processes, misalignment with human expectations, the complexity of agent dependencies, and the high cost of manual inspection. This paper thus introduces a human-centered evaluation framework for Verifying LLM Agent failures (VeriLA), which systematically assesses agent failures to reduce human effort and make these agent failures interpretable to humans. The framework first defines clear expectations of each agent by curating human-designed agent criteria. Then, it develops a human-aligned agent verifier module, trained with human gold standards, to assess each agent's execution output. This approach enables granular evaluation of each agent's performance by revealing failures from a human standard, offering clear guidelines for revision, and reducing human cognitive load. Our case study results show that VeriLA is both interpretable and efficient in helping practitioners interact more effectively with the system. By upholding accountability in human-agent collaboration, VeriLA paves the way for more trustworthy and human-aligned compound AI systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Being-0: A Humanoid Robotic Agent with Vision-Language Models and Modular Skills](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12533v1)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Building autonomous robotic agents capable of achieving human-level performance in real-world embodied tasks is an ultimate goal in humanoid robot research. Recent advances have made significant progress in high-level cognition with Foundation Models (FMs) and low-level skill development for humanoid robots. However, directly combining these components often results in poor robustness and efficiency due to compounding errors in long-horizon tasks and the varied latency of different modules. We introduce Being-0, a hierarchical agent framework that integrates an FM with a modular skill library. The FM handles high-level cognitive tasks such as instruction understanding, task planning, and reasoning, while the skill library provides stable locomotion and dexterous manipulation for low-level control. To bridge the gap between these levels, we propose a novel Connector module, powered by a lightweight vision-language model (VLM). The Connector enhances the FM's embodied capabilities by translating language-based plans into actionable skill commands and dynamically coordinating locomotion and manipulation to improve task success. With all components, except the FM, deployable on low-cost onboard computation devices, Being-0 achieves efficient, real-time performance on a full-sized humanoid robot equipped with dexterous hands and active vision. Extensive experiments in large indoor environments demonstrate Being-0's effectiveness in solving complex, long-horizon tasks that require challenging navigation and manipulation subtasks.

| **[STEVE: AStep Verification Pipeline for Computer-use Agent Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12532v1)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developing AI agents to autonomously manipulate graphical user interfaces is a long challenging task. Recent advances in data scaling law inspire us to train computer-use agents with a scaled instruction set, yet using behavior cloning to train agents still requires immense high-quality trajectories. To meet the scalability need, we designed STEVE, a step verification pipeline for computer-use agent training. First, we establish a large instruction set for computer-use agents and collect trajectory data with some suboptimal agents. GPT-4o is used to verify the correctness of each step in the trajectories based on the screens before and after the action execution, assigning each step with a binary label. Last, we adopt the Kahneman and Tversky Optimization to optimize the agent from the binary stepwise labels. Extensive experiments manifest that our agent outperforms supervised finetuning by leveraging both positive and negative actions within a trajectory. Also, STEVE enables us to train a 7B vision-language model as a computer-use agent, achieving leading performance in the challenging live desktop environment WinAgentArena with great efficiency at a reduced cost.

| **[Iterative Motion Planning in Multi-agent Systems with Opportunistic Communication under Disturbance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12457v1)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In complex multi-agent systems involving heterogeneous teams, uncertainty arises from numerous sources like environmental disturbances, model inaccuracies, and changing tasks. This causes planned trajectories to become infeasible, requiring replanning. Further, different communication architectures used in multi-agent systems give rise to asymmetric knowledge of planned trajectories across the agents. In such systems, replanning must be done in a communication-aware fashion. This paper establishes the conditions for synchronization and feasibility in epistemic planning scenarios introduced by opportunistic communication architectures. We also establish conditions on task satisfaction based on quantified recoverability of disturbances in an iterative planning scheme. We further validate these theoretical results experimentally in a UAV--UGV task assignment problem.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Survey on the Optimization of Large Language Model-based Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12434v1)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs), LLM-based agents have been widely adopted in various fields, becoming essential for autonomous decision-making and interactive tasks. However, current work typically relies on prompt design or fine-tuning strategies applied to vanilla LLMs, which often leads to limited effectiveness or suboptimal performance in complex agent-related environments. Although LLM optimization techniques can improve model performance across many general tasks, they lack specialized optimization towards critical agent functionalities such as long-term planning, dynamic environmental interaction, and complex decision-making. Although numerous recent studies have explored various strategies to optimize LLM-based agents for complex agent tasks, a systematic review summarizing and comparing these methods from a holistic perspective is still lacking. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of LLM-based agent optimization approaches, categorizing them into parameter-driven and parameter-free methods. We first focus on parameter-driven optimization, covering fine-tuning-based optimization, reinforcement learning-based optimization, and hybrid strategies, analyzing key aspects such as trajectory data construction, fine-tuning techniques, reward function design, and optimization algorithms. Additionally, we briefly discuss parameter-free strategies that optimize agent behavior through prompt engineering and external knowledge retrieval. Finally, we summarize the datasets and benchmarks used for evaluation and tuning, review key applications of LLM-based agents, and discuss major challenges and promising future directions.

However, this advancement also introduces potential security vulnerabilities that have yet to be thoroughly explored. In this paper, we present a systematic security investigation of multi-modal mobile GUI agents, addressing this critical gap in the existing literature. Our contributions are twofold: (1) we propose a novel threat modeling methodology, leading to the discovery and feasibility analysis of 34 previously unreported attacks, and (2) we design an attack framework to systematically construct and evaluate these threats. Through a combination of real-world case studies and extensive dataset-driven experiments, we validate the severity and practicality of those attacks, highlighting the pressing need for robust security measures in mobile GUI systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

| **[Unveiling Pitfalls: Understanding Why AI-driven Code Agents Fail at GitHub Issue Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12374v1)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI-driven software development has rapidly advanced with the emergence of software development agents that leverage large language models (LLMs) to tackle complex, repository-level software engineering tasks. These agents go beyond just generation of final code; they engage in multi-step reasoning, utilize various tools for code modification and debugging, and interact with execution environments to diagnose and iteratively resolve issues. However, most existing evaluations focus primarily on static analyses of final code outputs, yielding limited insights into the agents' dynamic problem-solving processes. To fill this gap, we conduct an in-depth empirical study on 3,977 solving-phase trajectories and 3,931 testing-phase logs from 8 top-ranked agents evaluated on 500 GitHub issues in the SWE-Bench benchmark. Our exploratory analysis shows that Python execution errors during the issue resolution phase correlate with lower resolution rates and increased reasoning overheads. We have identified the most prevalent errors -- such as ModuleNotFoundError and TypeError -- and highlighted particularly challenging errors like OSError and database-related issues (e.g., IntegrityError) that demand significantly more debugging effort. Furthermore, we have discovered 3 bugs in the SWE-Bench platform that affect benchmark fairness and accuracy; these issues have been reported to and confirmed by the maintainers. To promote transparency and foster future research, we publicly share our datasets and analysis scripts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can A Society of Generative Agents Simulate Human Behavior and Inform Public Health Policy? A Case Study on Vaccine Hesitancy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09639v2)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Can we simulate a sandbox society with generative agents to model human behavior, thereby reducing the over-reliance on real human trials for assessing public policies? In this work, we investigate the feasibility of simulating health-related decision-making, using vaccine hesitancy, defined as the delay in acceptance or refusal of vaccines despite the availability of vaccination services (MacDonald, 2015), as a case study. To this end, we introduce the VacSim framework with 100 generative agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). VacSim simulates vaccine policy outcomes with the following steps: 1) instantiate a population of agents with demographics based on census data; 2) connect the agents via a social network and model vaccine attitudes as a function of social dynamics and disease-related information; 3) design and evaluate various public health interventions aimed at mitigating vaccine hesitancy. To align with real-world results, we also introduce simulation warmup and attitude modulation to adjust agents' attitudes. We propose a series of evaluations to assess the reliability of various LLM simulations. Experiments indicate that models like Llama and Qwen can simulate aspects of human behavior but also highlight real-world alignment challenges, such as inconsistent responses with demographic profiles. This early exploration of LLM-driven simulations is not meant to serve as definitive policy guidance; instead, it serves as a call for action to examine social simulation for policy development.</p></details> |  |
| **[GameChat: Multi-LLM Dialogue for Safe, Agile, and Socially Optimal Multi-Agent Navigation in Constrained Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12333v1)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Safe, agile, and socially compliant multi-robot navigation in cluttered and constrained environments remains a critical challenge. This is especially difficult with self-interested agents in decentralized settings, where there is no central authority to resolve conflicts induced by spatial symmetry. We address this challenge by proposing a novel approach, GameChat, which facilitates safe, agile, and deadlock-free navigation for both cooperative and self-interested agents. Key to our approach is the use of natural language communication to resolve conflicts, enabling agents to prioritize more urgent tasks and break spatial symmetry in a socially optimal manner. Our algorithm ensures subgame perfect equilibrium, preventing agents from deviating from agreed-upon behaviors and supporting cooperation. Furthermore, we guarantee safety through control barrier functions and preserve agility by minimizing disruptions to agents' planned trajectories. We evaluate GameChat in simulated environments with doorways and intersections. The results show that even in the worst case, GameChat reduces the time for all agents to reach their goals by over 35% from a naive baseline and by over 20% from SMG-CBF in the intersection scenario, while doubling the rate of ensuring the agent with a higher priority task reaches the goal first, from 50% (equivalent to random chance) to a 100% perfect performance at maximizing social welfare.</p></details> |  |

We have recently introduced SensorsConnect, a unified framework to enable seamless content and sensor data sharing in collaborative IoT systems, inspired by how the World Wide Web (WWW) enabled a shared and accessible space for information among humans. This paper presents the IoT Agentic Search Engine (IoT-ASE), a real-time search engine tailored for IoT environments. IoT-ASE leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques to address the challenge of searching vast, real-time IoT data, enabling it to handle complex queries and deliver accurate, contextually relevant results. We implemented a use-case scenario in Toronto to demonstrate how IoT-ASE can improve service quality recommendations by leveraging real-time IoT data. Our evaluation shows that IoT-ASE achieves a 92\% accuracy in retrieving intent-based services and produces responses that are concise, relevant, and context-aware, outperforming generalized responses from systems like Gemini. These findings highlight the potential IoT-ASE to make real-time IoT data accessible and support effective, real-time decision-making.</p></details> |  |
| **[TFHE-Coder: Evaluating LLM-agentic Fully Homomorphic Encryption Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12217v1)** | 2025-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fully Homomorphic Encryption over the torus (TFHE) enables computation on encrypted data without decryption, making it a cornerstone of secure and confidential computing. Despite its potential in privacy preserving machine learning, secure multi party computation, private blockchain transactions, and secure medical diagnostics, its adoption remains limited due to cryptographic complexity and usability challenges. While various TFHE libraries and compilers exist, practical code generation remains a hurdle. We propose a compiler integrated framework to evaluate LLM inference and agentic optimization for TFHE code generation, focusing on logic gates and ReLU activation. Our methodology assesses error rates, compilability, and structural similarity across open and closedsource LLMs. Results highlight significant limitations in off-the-shelf models, while agentic optimizations such as retrieval augmented generation (RAG) and few-shot prompting reduce errors and enhance code fidelity. This work establishes the first benchmark for TFHE code generation, demonstrating how LLMs, when augmented with domain-specific feedback, can bridge the expertise gap in FHE code generation.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |

Our analysis identifies six agent attributes, seven task attributes, and seven evaluation metrics from existing literature. Based on these findings, we present an RPA evaluation design guideline to help researchers develop more systematic and consistent evaluation methods.</p></details> |  |

A local interaction leader follower (LILF) structure is provided by coupling the advantages of information consensus and leader follower frame, the agents can obtain the state information of the leader by interacting with their neighbours, which will reduce the communication overhead of the system and the dependence on a single node of the topology. In addition, the artificial potential field (APF) method is introduced to achieve obstacle avoidance and collision avoidance between agents. Inspired by the stress response of animals, a stress response mechanism-artificial potential field (SRM-APF) is proposed, which will be triggered when the local minimum problem of APF occurs. Ultimately, the simulation experiments of three formation shapes, including triangular formation, square formation and hexagonal formation, validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |

In real-world applications, multi-agent systems will inevitably interact with untrusted inputs, such as malicious Web content, files, email attachments, etc. Using several recently proposed multi-agent frameworks as concrete examples, we demonstrate that adversarial content can hijack control and communication within the system to invoke unsafe agents and functionalities. This results in a complete security breach, up to execution of arbitrary malicious code on the user's device and/or exfiltration of sensitive data from the user's containerized environment. We show that control-flow hijacking attacks succeed even if the individual agents are not susceptible to direct or indirect prompt injection, and even if they refuse to perform harmful actions.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 5 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

This paper introduces AgentDroid, a novel framework for Android fraudulent application detection based on multi-modal analysis and multi-agent systems. AgentDroid overcomes the limitations of traditional detection methods such as the inability to handle multimodal data and high false alarm rates. It processes Android applications and extracts a series of multi-modal data for analysis. Multiple LLM-based agents with specialized roles analyze the relevant data and collaborate to detect complex fraud effectively. We constructed a dataset containing various categories of fraudulent applications and legitimate applications and validated our framework on this dataset. Experimental results indicate that our multi-agent framework based on GPT-4o achieves an accuracy of 91.7% and an F1-Score of 91.68%, showing improved detection accuracy over the baseline methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[V-Stylist: Video Stylization via Collaboration and Reflection of MLLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12077v1)** | 2025-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the recent advancement in video stylization, most existing methods struggle to render any video with complex transitions, based on an open style description of user query. To fill this gap, we introduce a generic multi-agent system for video stylization, V-Stylist, by a novel collaboration and reflection paradigm of multi-modal large language models. Specifically, our V-Stylist is a systematical workflow with three key roles: (1) Video Parser decomposes the input video into a number of shots and generates their text prompts of key shot content. Via a concise video-to-shot prompting paradigm, it allows our V-Stylist to effectively handle videos with complex transitions. (2) Style Parser identifies the style in the user query and progressively search the matched style model from a style tree. Via a robust tree-of-thought searching paradigm, it allows our V-Stylist to precisely specify vague style preference in the open user query. (3) Style Artist leverages the matched model to render all the video shots into the required style. Via a novel multi-round self-reflection paradigm, it allows our V-Stylist to adaptively adjust detail control, according to the style requirement. With such a distinct design of mimicking human professionals, our V-Stylist achieves a major breakthrough over the primary challenges for effective and automatic video stylization. Moreover,we further construct a new benchmark Text-driven Video Stylization Benchmark (TVSBench), which fills the gap to assess stylization of complex videos on open user queries. Extensive experiments show that, V-Stylist achieves the state-of-the-art, e.g.,V-Stylist surpasses FRESCO and ControlVideo by 6.05% and 4.51% respectively in overall average metrics, marking a significant advance in video stylization.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |

An Empirical Analysis of MAD in Code Summarization and Translation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12029v1)** | 2025-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced autonomous agents' planning and decision-making, yet they struggle with complex tasks requiring diverse expertise and multi-step reasoning. Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) systems, introduced in NLP research, address this gap by enabling structured debates among LLM-based agents to refine solutions iteratively. MAD promotes divergent thinking through role-specific agents, dynamic interactions, and structured decision-making. Recognizing parallels between Software Engineering (SE) and collaborative human problem-solving, this study investigates MAD's effectiveness on two SE tasks. We adapt MAD systems from NLP, analyze agent interactions to assess consensus-building and iterative refinement, and propose two enhancements targeting observed weaknesses. Our findings show that structured debate and collaboration improve problem-solving and yield strong performance in some cases, highlighting MAD's potential for SE automation while identifying areas for exploration.</p></details> |  |

This paper demonstrates how LLMs, when augmented with predefined functions and specialized tools, can serve as dynamic agents capable of streamlining tasks such as data collection, preprocessing, and analysis. Central to this approach is agentic retrieval-augmented generation (Agentic RAG), which equips LLMs with action-calling capabilities for interaction with external knowledge bases. Beyond information retrieval, LLM agents may incorporate modular tools for tasks like document summarization, transcript coding, qualitative variable classification, and statistical modeling. To demonstrate the potential of this approach, we introduce CongressRA, an LLM agent designed to support scholars studying the U.S. Congress. Through this example, we highlight how LLM agents can reduce the costs of replicating, testing, and extending empirical research using the domain-specific data that drives the study of political institutions.</p></details> | 46 pages, 6 figures |

A popular approach to modeling the multi-agent interactions underlying the multi-agent RL problem is the Markov Game. There is a special type of Markov Game, termed Markov Potential Game, which allows us to reduce the Markov Game to a single-objective optimal control problem where the objective function is a potential function. In this work, we prove that a multi-agent collaborative field coverage problem, which is found in many engineering applications, can be formulated as a Markov Potential Game, and we can learn a parameterized closed-loop Nash Equilibrium by solving an equivalent single-objective optimal control problem. As a result, our algorithm is 10x faster during training compared to a game-theoretic baseline and converges faster during policy execution.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to conference; in review</p></details> |

While Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently emerged as promising tools for TSC due to their exceptional problem-solving and generalization capabilities, existing approaches fail to address the essential need for inter-agent coordination, limiting their effectiveness in achieving network-wide optimization. To bridge this gap, we propose CoLLMLight, a cooperative LLM agent framework for TSC. Specifically, we first construct a structured spatiotemporal graph to capture real-time traffic dynamics and spatial relationships among neighboring intersections, enabling the LLM to reason about complex traffic interactions. Moreover, we introduce a complexity-aware reasoning mechanism that dynamically adapts reasoning depth based on real-time traffic conditions, ensuring optimal computational efficiency without sacrificing decision quality. Besides, we propose a fine-tuning strategy that leverages iterative simulation-driven data collection and environmental feedback to build a lightweight LLM tailored for cooperative TSC. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that CoLLMLight outperforms state-of-the-art methods in diverse traffic scenarios, showcasing its effectiveness, scalability, and robustness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review, 14 pages</p></details> |

A static operation center (OC) periodically requests information from changing goal locations. The objective is to gather data in the goals and to deliver it to the OC, balancing the refreshing time and the total number of information packages. The system automatically splits the team in two roles: workers to gather data, or collectors to retransmit the data to the OC. The proposed three step method: 1) finds out the best area partition for the workers; 2) obtains the best balance between workers and collectors, and with whom the workers must to communicate, a collector or the OC; 3) computes the best tour for the workers to visit the goals and deliver them to the OC or to a collector in movement. The method is tested in simulations in different scenarios, providing the best area partition algorithm and the best balance between collectors and workers.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, through the application of LTLt and Coordination Synthesis, we aim to check whether various Cops and Robbers games are realizable (a strategy exists for the cops which guarantees they catch the robbers). Additionally, we construct this strategy as an executable program for the multiple system players in our games. In this paper we formalize the problem space, and propose potential directions for solutions. We also show how our formalization of this generalized cops and robbers game can be mapped to a broad range of other problems in the reactive program synthesis space.</p></details> |  |

We analyse the learning and behaviour of two agents within a symmetrical grid world that must cross paths to reach a target destination without crashing into each other or straying off of the grid world in the wrong direction. The agent policy is determined by one neural network that is employed in both agents. Our findings indicate that the fully trained network exhibits behaviour similar to that of the game Hawks and Doves, in that one agent employs an aggressive strategy to reach the target while the other learns how to avoid the aggressive agent.</p></details> |  |

Biography generation, as a specialized form of abstractive summarization, plays a crucial role in historical research but faces unique challenges that existing large language models (LLMs) struggle to address. These challenges include maintaining stylistic adherence to historical writing conventions, ensuring factual fidelity, and handling fragmented information across multiple documents. We present AIstorian, a novel end-to-end agentic system featured with a knowledge graph (KG)-powered retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and anti-hallucination multi-agents. Specifically, AIstorian introduces an in-context learning based chunking strategy and a KG-based index for accurate and efficient reference retrieval. Meanwhile, AIstorian orchestrates multi-agents to conduct on-the-fly hallucination detection and error-type-aware correction. Additionally, to teach LLMs a certain language style, we finetune LLMs based on a two-step training approach combining data augmentation-enhanced supervised fine-tuning with stylistic preference optimization. Extensive experiments on a real-life historical Jinshi dataset demonstrate that AIstorian achieves a 3.8x improvement in factual accuracy and a 47.6% reduction in hallucination rate compared to existing baselines.

Despite recent advancements, LLMs still face significant challenges in reasoning with structured data, handling dynamic knowledge evolution, and mitigating hallucinations, particularly in mission-critical domains. Our proposed RAG-KG-IL framework addresses these limitations by employing a multi-agent architecture that enables continuous knowledge updates, integrates structured knowledge, and incorporates autonomous agents for enhanced explainability and reasoning. The framework utilizes RAG to ensure the generated responses are grounded in verifiable information, while KGs provide structured domain knowledge for improved consistency and depth of understanding. The Incremental Learning approach allows for dynamic updates to the knowledge base without full retraining, significantly reducing computational overhead and improving the model's adaptability. We evaluate the framework using real-world case studies involving health-related queries, comparing it to state-of-the-art models like GPT-4o and a RAG-only baseline. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces hallucination rates and improves answer completeness and reasoning accuracy. The results underscore the potential of combining RAG, KGs, and multi-agent systems to create intelligent, adaptable systems capable of real-time knowledge integration and reasoning in complex domains.</p></details> |  |

However, optimizing such workflows is costly and inefficient in real-world applications due to extensive invocations of LLMs. To fill this gap, this position paper formulates agentic workflows as computational graphs and advocates Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) as efficient predictors of agentic workflow performances, avoiding repeated LLM invocations for evaluation. To empirically ground this position, we construct FLORA-Bench, a unified platform for benchmarking GNNs for predicting agentic workflow performances. With extensive experiments, we arrive at the following conclusion: GNNs are simple yet effective predictors. This conclusion supports new applications of GNNs and a novel direction towards automating agentic workflow optimization.

By emulating the cognitive behaviors of a human painter, EmoAgent incorporates three specialized agents responsible for planning, editing, and critical evaluation. Furthermore, we develop an emotion-factor knowledge retriever, a decision-making tree space, and a tool library to enhance EmoAgent's effectiveness in handling AIM. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed multi-agent framework outperforms existing methods, offering more reasonable and effective emotional expression.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we propose an automated GUI data generation pipeline, AutoCaptioner, which generates data with rich descriptions while minimizing human effort. Using AutoCaptioner, we created a novel large-scale desktop GUI dataset, DeskVision, along with the largest desktop test benchmark, DeskVision-Eval, which reflects daily usage and covers diverse systems and UI elements, each with rich descriptions. With DeskVision, we train a new GUI understanding model, GUIExplorer. Results show that GUIExplorer achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in understanding/grounding visual elements without the need for complex architectural designs. We further validated the effectiveness of the DeskVision dataset through ablation studies on various large visual language models (LVLMs). We believe that AutoCaptioner and DeskVision will significantly advance the development of GUI agents, and will open-source them for the community.</p></details> |  |
| **[ReMA: Learning to Meta-think for LLMs with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09501v2)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent research on Reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs) has sought to further enhance their performance by integrating meta-thinking -- enabling models to monitor, evaluate, and control their reasoning processes for more adaptive and effective problem-solving. However, current single-agent work lacks a specialized design for acquiring meta-thinking, resulting in low efficacy. To address this challenge, we introduce Reinforced Meta-thinking Agents (ReMA), a novel framework that leverages Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) to elicit meta-thinking behaviors, encouraging LLMs to think about thinking. ReMA decouples the reasoning process into two hierarchical agents: a high-level meta-thinking agent responsible for generating strategic oversight and plans, and a low-level reasoning agent for detailed executions. Through iterative reinforcement learning with aligned objectives, these agents explore and learn collaboration, leading to improved generalization and robustness. Experimental results demonstrate that ReMA outperforms single-agent RL baselines on complex reasoning tasks, including competitive-level mathematical benchmarks and LLM-as-a-Judge benchmarks. Comprehensive ablation studies further illustrate the evolving dynamics of each distinct agent, providing valuable insights into how the meta-thinking reasoning process enhances the reasoning capabilities of LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generative Multi-Agent Q-Learning for Policy Optimization: Decentralized Wireless Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05970v2)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Q-learning is a widely used reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm for optimizing wireless networks, but faces challenges with large state-spaces. Recently proposed multi-environment mixed Q-learning (MEMQ) algorithm addresses these challenges by employing multiple Q-learning algorithms across multiple synthetically generated, distinct but structurally related environments, so-called digital cousins. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-agent MEMQ (M-MEMQ) for cooperative decentralized wireless networks with multiple networked transmitters (TXs) and base stations (BSs). TXs do not have access to global information (joint state and actions). The new concept of coordinated and uncoordinated states is introduced. In uncoordinated states, TXs act independently to minimize their individual costs and update local Q-functions. In coordinated states, TXs use a Bayesian approach to estimate the joint state and update the joint Q-functions. The cost of information-sharing scales linearly with the number of TXs and is independent of the joint state-action space size. Several theoretical guarantees, including deterministic and probabilistic convergence, bounds on estimation error variance, and the probability of misdetecting the joint states, are given. Numerical simulations show that M-MEMQ outperforms several decentralized and centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) multi-agent RL algorithms by achieving 55% lower average policy error (APE), 35% faster convergence, 50% reduced runtime complexity, and 45% less sample complexity. Furthermore, M-MEMQ achieves comparable APE with significantly lower complexity than centralized methods. Simulations validate the theoretical analyses.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

Yet, this progress disrupts traditional agent frameworks, traditionally anchored by execution-oriented Large Language Models (LLMs). To explore this transformation, we propose the LaRMA framework, encompassing nine tasks across Tool Usage, Plan Design, and Problem Solving, assessed with three top LLMs (e.g., Claude3.5-sonnet) and five leading LRMs (e.g., DeepSeek-R1). Our findings address four research questions: LRMs surpass LLMs in reasoning-intensive tasks like Plan Design, leveraging iterative reflection for superior outcomes; LLMs excel in execution-driven tasks such as Tool Usage, prioritizing efficiency; hybrid LLM-LRM configurations, pairing LLMs as actors with LRMs as reflectors, optimize agent performance by blending execution speed with reasoning depth; and LRMs' enhanced reasoning incurs higher computational costs, prolonged processing, and behavioral challenges, including overthinking and fact-ignoring tendencies. This study fosters deeper inquiry into LRMs' balance of deep thinking and overthinking, laying a critical foundation for future agent design advancements.</p></details> | <details><summary>71 pa...</summary><p>71 pages, 5 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

Additionally, many existing architectures struggle with scalability, relying on a fixed structure tied to a specific number of agents, limiting their applicability to environments with a variable number of entities. While approaches such as graph neural networks (GNNs) and self-attention mechanisms have progressed in addressing these challenges, they have significant limitations as dense GNNs and self-attention mechanisms incur high computational costs. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel agent network and a non-linear mixing network that ensure permutation-equivariance and scalability, allowing them to generalize to environments with various numbers of agents. Our agent network significantly reduces computational complexity, and our scalable hypernetwork enables efficient weight generation for non-linear mixing. Additionally, we introduce curriculum learning to improve training efficiency. Experiments on SMACv2 and Google Research Football (GRF) demonstrate that our approach achieves superior learning performance compared to existing methods. By addressing both permutation-invariance and scalability in MARL, our work provides a more efficient and adaptable framework for cooperative MARL. Our code is available at https://github.com/funny-rl/SPECTra.</p></details> | 31 pages, 14 figures |

While API-based LLM agents initially rose to prominence for their robust automation capabilities and seamless integration with programmatic endpoints, recent progress in multimodal LLM research has enabled GUI-based LLM agents that interact with graphical user interfaces in a human-like manner. Although these two paradigms share the goal of enabling LLM-driven task automation, they diverge significantly in architectural complexity, development workflows, and user interaction models. This paper presents the first comprehensive comparative study of API-based and GUI-based LLM agents, systematically analyzing their divergence and potential convergence. We examine key dimensions and highlight scenarios in which hybrid approaches can harness their complementary strengths. By proposing clear decision criteria and illustrating practical use cases, we aim to guide practitioners and researchers in selecting, combining, or transitioning between these paradigms. Ultimately, we indicate that continuing innovations in LLM-based automation are poised to blur the lines between API- and GUI-driven agents, paving the way for more flexible, adaptive solutions in a wide range of real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

Creating aesthetically pleasing banner designs while conveying the campaign messages is challenging due to the large search space involving multiple design elements. Additionally, advertisers need multiple sizes for different displays and various versions to target different sectors of audiences. Since design is intrinsically an iterative and subjective process, flexible editability is also in high demand for practical usage. While current models have served as assistants to human designers in various design tasks, they typically handle only segments of the creative design process or produce pixel-based outputs that limit editability. This paper introduces a training-free framework for fully automated banner ad design creation, enabling frontier multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to streamline the production of effective banners with minimal manual effort across diverse marketing contexts. We present BannerAgency, an MLLM agent system that collaborates with advertisers to understand their brand identity and banner objectives, generates matching background images, creates blueprints for foreground design elements, and renders the final creatives as editable components in Figma or SVG formats rather than static pixels. To facilitate evaluation and future research, we introduce BannerRequest400, a benchmark featuring 100 unique logos paired with 400 diverse banner requests. Through quantitative and qualitative evaluations, we demonstrate the framework's effectiveness, emphasizing the quality of the generated banner designs, their adaptability to various banner requests, and their strong editability enabled by this component-based approach.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents SERN (Simulation-Enhanced Realistic Navigation), a novel framework integrating virtual and physical environments for real-time collaborative decision-making in multi-robot systems. SERN addresses key challenges in asset deployment and coordination through our bi-directional SERN ROS Bridge communication framework. Our approach advances the SOTA through: accurate real-world representation in virtual environments using Unity high-fidelity simulator; synchronization of physical and virtual robot movements; efficient ROS data distribution between remote locations; and integration of SOTA semantic segmentation for enhanced environmental perception. Additionally, we introduce a Multi-Metric Cost Function (MMCF) that dynamically balances latency, reliability, computational overhead, and bandwidth consumption to optimize system performance in contested environments. We further provide theoretical justification for synchronization accuracy by proving that the positional error between physical and virtual robots remains bounded under varying network conditions. Our evaluations show a 15% to 24% improvement in latency and up to a 15% increase in processing efficiency compared to traditional ROS setups. Real-world and virtual simulation experiments with multiple robots (Clearpath Jackal and Husky) demonstrate synchronization accuracy, achieving less than $5\text{ cm}$ positional error and under $2^\circ$ rotational error. These results highlight SERN's potential to enhance situational awareness and multi-agent coordination in diverse, contested environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under Review for IROS 2025</p></details> |

We introduce TxAgent, an AI agent that leverages multi-step reasoning and real-time biomedical knowledge retrieval across a toolbox of 211 tools to analyze drug interactions, contraindications, and patient-specific treatment strategies. TxAgent evaluates how drugs interact at molecular, pharmacokinetic, and clinical levels, identifies contraindications based on patient comorbidities and concurrent medications, and tailors treatment strategies to individual patient characteristics. It retrieves and synthesizes evidence from multiple biomedical sources, assesses interactions between drugs and patient conditions, and refines treatment recommendations through iterative reasoning. It selects tools based on task objectives and executes structured function calls to solve therapeutic tasks that require clinical reasoning and cross-source validation. The ToolUniverse consolidates 211 tools from trusted sources, including all US FDA-approved drugs since 1939 and validated clinical insights from Open Targets. TxAgent outperforms leading LLMs, tool-use models, and reasoning agents across five new benchmarks: DrugPC, BrandPC, GenericPC, TreatmentPC, and DescriptionPC, covering 3,168 drug reasoning tasks and 456 personalized treatment scenarios. It achieves 92.1% accuracy in open-ended drug reasoning tasks, surpassing GPT-4o and outperforming DeepSeek-R1 (671B) in structured multi-step reasoning.

Prior work primarily focuses on single-frame cooperative perception, which fuses agents' information across different spatial locations but ignores temporal cues and temporal tasks (e.g., temporal perception and prediction). In this paper, we focus on the spatio-temporal fusion in V2X scenarios and design one-step and multi-step communication strategies (when to transmit) as well as examine their integration with three fusion strategies - early, late, and intermediate (what to transmit), providing comprehensive benchmarks with 11 fusion models (how to fuse). Furthermore, we propose V2XPnP, a novel intermediate fusion framework within one-step communication for end-to-end perception and prediction. Our framework employs a unified Transformer-based architecture to effectively model complex spatio-temporal relationships across multiple agents, frames, and high-definition map. Moreover, we introduce the V2XPnP Sequential Dataset that supports all V2X collaboration modes and addresses the limitations of existing real-world datasets, which are restricted to single-frame or single-mode cooperation. Extensive experiments demonstrate our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both perception and prediction tasks.

Reinforcement learning (RL)-based strategies for human mobility management have recently advanced in addressing the dynamic evolution of cities and epidemics; however, they still face challenges in achieving coordinated control at the township level and adapting to cities of varying scales. To address the above issues, we propose a multi-agent RL approach that achieves Pareto optimality in managing hospital capacity and human mobility (H2-MARL), applicable across cities of different scales. We first develop a township-level infection model with online-updatable parameters to simulate disease transmission and construct a city-wide dynamic spatiotemporal epidemic simulator. On this basis, H2-MARL is designed to treat each division as an agent, with a trade-off dual-objective reward function formulated and an experience replay buffer enriched with expert knowledge built. To evaluate the effectiveness of the model, we construct a township-level human mobility dataset containing over one billion records from four representative cities of varying scales. Extensive experiments demonstrate that H2-MARL has the optimal dual-objective trade-off capability, which can minimize hospital capacity strain while minimizing human mobility restriction loss. Meanwhile, the applicability of the proposed model to epidemic control in cities of varying scales is verified, which showcases its feasibility and versatility in practical applications.</p></details> |  |

Being trained with a huge of amount of data coming from various sources, LLMs can be deployed to solve different tasks, including those in Software Engineering (SE). Though they have been widely adopted, the potential of using LLMs cooperatively has not been thoroughly investigated. In this paper, we proposed Metagente as a novel approach to amplify the synergy of various LLMs. Metagente is a Multi-Agent framework based on a series of LLMs to self-optimize the system through evaluation, feedback, and cooperation among specialized agents. Such a framework creates an environment where multiple agents iteratively refine and optimize prompts from various perspectives. The results of these explorations are then reviewed and aggregated by a teacher agent. To study its performance, we evaluated Metagente with an SE task, i.e., summarization of README.MD files, and compared it with three well-established baselines, i.e., GitSum, LLaMA-2, and GPT-4o. The results show that our proposed approach works efficiently and effectively, consuming a small amount of data for fine-tuning but still getting a high accuracy, thus substantially outperforming the baselines. The performance gain compared to GitSum, the most relevant benchmark, ranges from 27.63% to 60.43%. More importantly, compared to using only one LLM, Metagente boots up the accuracy to multiple folds.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper has been peer-reviewed and accepted for publication in the proceedings of International Conference on Foundations of Software Engineering conference (FSE 2025)</p></details> |

These multimodal OS agents autonomously perform computer-based tasks in response to a single prompt via application programming interfaces (APIs). Such APIs typically support low-level operations, including mouse clicks, keyboard inputs, and screenshot captures. We introduce a novel attack vector: malicious image patches (MIPs) that have been adversarially perturbed so that, when captured in a screenshot, they cause an OS agent to perform harmful actions by exploiting specific APIs. For instance, MIPs embedded in desktop backgrounds or shared on social media can redirect an agent to a malicious website, enabling further exploitation. These MIPs generalise across different user requests and screen layouts, and remain effective for multiple OS agents. The existence of such attacks highlights critical security vulnerabilities in OS agents, which should be carefully addressed before their widespread adoption.</p></details> |  |

One promising technique for ensuring the safety of MAS is distributed control barrier functions (CBF). However, it is difficult to design distributed CBF-based policies for MAS that can tackle unknown discrete-time dynamics, partial observability, changing neighborhoods, and input constraints, especially when a distributed high-performance nominal policy that can achieve the task is unavailable. To tackle these challenges, we propose DGPPO, a new framework that simultaneously learns both a discrete graph CBF which handles neighborhood changes and input constraints, and a distributed high-performance safe policy for MAS with unknown discrete-time dynamics. We empirically validate our claims on a suite of multi-agent tasks spanning three different simulation engines. The results suggest that, compared with existing methods, our DGPPO framework obtains policies that achieve high task performance (matching baselines that ignore the safety constraints), and high safety rates (matching the most conservative baselines), with a constant set of hyperparameters across all environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 15 figures; Accepted by the thirteenth International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2025)</p></details> |

However, existing simulation platforms exhibit two major issues: performance and modularity. Low performance prevents simulations with a large number of agents, increases development time, limits parameter exploration, and raises computing costs. Inflexible software designs motivate modelers to create their own tools, diverting valuable resources. This dissertation introduces a novel simulation platform called BioDynaMo and its significant improvement, TeraAgent, to alleviate these challenges via three major works. First, we lay the platform's foundation by defining abstractions, establishing software infrastructure, and implementing a multitude of features for agent-based modeling. We demonstrate BioDynaMo's modularity through use cases in neuroscience, epidemiology, and oncology. We validate these models and show the simplicity of adding new functionality with few lines of code. Second, we perform a rigorous performance analysis and identify challenges for shared-memory parallelism. Provided solutions include an optimized grid for neighbor searching, mechanisms to reduce the memory access latency, and exploiting domain knowledge to omit unnecessary work. These improvements yield up to three orders of magnitude speedups, enabling simulations of 1.7 billion agents on a single server. Third, we present TeraAgent, a distributed simulation engine that allows scaling out the computation of one simulation to multiple servers. We identify and address server communication bottlenecks and implement solutions for serialization and delta encoding to accelerate and reduce data transfer. TeraAgent can simulate 500 billion agents and scales to 84096 CPU cores.

We present the first work investigating embodied confidence elicitation in open-ended multimodal environments. We introduce Elicitation Policies, which structure confidence assessment across inductive, deductive, and abductive reasoning, along with Execution Policies, which enhance confidence calibration through scenario reinterpretation, action sampling, and hypothetical reasoning. Evaluating agents in calibration and failure prediction tasks within the Minecraft environment, we show that structured reasoning approaches, such as Chain-of-Thoughts, improve confidence calibration. However, our findings also reveal persistent challenges in distinguishing uncertainty, particularly under abductive settings, underscoring the need for more sophisticated embodied confidence elicitation methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://plan-lab.github.io/ece/</p></details> |
| **[CoSTA$\ast$: Cost-Sensitive Toolpath Agent for Multi-turn Image Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10613v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image models like stable diffusion and DALLE-3 still struggle with multi-turn image editing. We decompose such a task as an agentic workflow (path) of tool use that addresses a sequence of subtasks by AI tools of varying costs. Conventional search algorithms require expensive exploration to find tool paths. While large language models (LLMs) possess prior knowledge of subtask planning, they may lack accurate estimations of capabilities and costs of tools to determine which to apply in each subtask. Can we combine the strengths of both LLMs and graph search to find cost-efficient tool paths? We propose a three-stage approach "CoSTA*" that leverages LLMs to create a subtask tree, which helps prune a graph of AI tools for the given task, and then conducts A* search on the small subgraph to find a tool path. To better balance the total cost and quality, CoSTA* combines both metrics of each tool on every subtask to guide the A* search. Each subtask's output is then evaluated by a vision-language model (VLM), where a failure will trigger an update of the tool's cost and quality on the subtask. Hence, the A* search can recover from failures quickly to explore other paths. Moreover, CoSTA* can automatically switch between modalities across subtasks for a better cost-quality trade-off. We build a novel benchmark of challenging multi-turn image editing, on which CoSTA* outperforms state-of-the-art image-editing models or agents in terms of both cost and quality, and performs versatile trade-offs upon user preference.</p></details> |  |

However, due to the substantial differences between remote sensing images and conventional optical images, these models face considerable challenges in comprehension, especially in detection tasks. Directly prompting VLMs with detection instructions often fails to yield satisfactory results. To address this issue, this letter explores the application of VLMs for object detection in remote sensing images. Specifically, we utilize publicly available remote sensing object detection datasets, including SSDD, HRSID, and NWPU-VHR-10, to convert traditional annotation information into natural language, thereby constructing an instruction-tuning (SFT) dataset for VLM training. We then evaluate the detection performance of different fine-tuning strategies for VLMs and obtain optimized model weights for object detection in remote sensing images. Finally, we assess the model's prior knowledge capabilities through natural language queries.Experimental results demonstrate that, without modifying the model architecture, remote sensing object detection can be effectively achieved using natural language alone. Additionally, the model exhibits the ability to perform certain vision question answering (VQA) tasks. Our dataset and relevant code will be released soon.</p></details> |  |

However, attempts to extend this success to multimodal reasoning often failed to reproduce these key characteristics. In this report, we present the first successful replication of these emergent characteristics for multimodal reasoning on only a non-SFT 2B model. Starting with Qwen2-VL-2B and applying reinforcement learning directly on the SAT dataset, our model achieves 59.47% accuracy on CVBench, outperforming the base model by approximately ~30% and exceeding both SFT setting by ~2%. In addition, we share our failed attempts and insights in attempting to achieve R1-like reasoning using RL with instruct models. aiming to shed light on the challenges involved. Our key observations include: (1) applying RL on instruct model often results in trivial reasoning trajectories, and (2) naive length reward are ineffective in eliciting reasoning capabilities.

However, RLHF has been continuously challenged by its high complexity in implementation and computation consumption. Even with recent simplifications, such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Advantage Leftover Lunch (A-LoL), the problems of over-fitting and training instability remain hindering the alignment process from the expected optimal performance. To address the existing challenges, we propose a novel simplification of RLHF from the perspective of variational inference, called $\textbf{V}$ariational $\textbf{A}$lignment with $\textbf{R}$e-weighting ($\textbf{VAR}$). More specifically, by directly minimizing the distribution gap between the learning LLM policy and the optimal solution of RLHF, we transform the alignment objective into a reward-driven re-weighted supervised fine-tuning (SFT) form, which only requires minor adjustment on the SFT loss to obtain noticeable improvement on training stability and effectiveness. On comprehensive alignment and generation benchmarks, our VAR method has numerically achieved competitive performance in LLM alignment helpfulness and harmlessness.</p></details> |  |

However, their roles in enhancing model generalization capabilities remain unclear. This paper studies the difference between SFT and RL on generalization and memorization, focusing on text-based rule variants and visual variants. We introduce GeneralPoints, an arithmetic reasoning card game, and adopt V-IRL, a real-world navigation environment, to assess how models trained with SFT and RL generalize to unseen variants in both textual and visual domains. We show that RL, especially when trained with an outcome-based reward, generalizes across both rule-based textual and visual variants. SFT, in contrast, tends to memorize training data and struggles to generalize out-of-distribution scenarios. Further analysis reveals that RL improves the model's underlying visual recognition capabilities, contributing to its enhanced generalization in the visual domain. Despite RL's superior generalization, we show that SFT remains essential for effective RL training; SFT stabilizes the model's output format, enabling subsequent RL to achieve its performance gains. These findings demonstrates the capability of RL for acquiring generalizable knowledge in complex, multi-modal tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website at https://tianzhechu.com/SFTvsRL</p></details> |
| **[Provably Mitigating Overoptimization in RLHF: Your SFT Loss is Implicitly an Adversarial Regularizer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16436v3)** | 2024-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aligning generative models with human preference via RLHF typically suffers from overoptimization, where an imperfectly learned reward model can misguide the generative model to output undesired responses. We investigate this problem in a principled manner by identifying the source of the misalignment as a form of distributional shift and uncertainty in learning human preferences. To mitigate overoptimization, we first propose a theoretical algorithm that chooses the best policy for an adversarially chosen reward model; one that simultaneously minimizes the maximum likelihood estimation of the loss and a reward penalty term. Here, the reward penalty term is introduced to prevent the policy from choosing actions with spurious high proxy rewards, resulting in provable sample efficiency of the algorithm under a partial coverage style condition. Moving from theory to practice, the proposed algorithm further enjoys an equivalent but surprisingly easy-to-implement reformulation. Using the equivalence between reward models and the corresponding optimal policy, the algorithm features a simple objective that combines: (i) a preference optimization loss that directly aligns the policy with human preference, and (ii) a supervised learning loss that explicitly imitates the policy with a (suitable) baseline distribution. In the context of aligning large language models (LLM), this objective fuses the direct preference optimization (DPO) loss with the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) loss to help mitigate the overoptimization towards undesired responses, for which we name the algorithm Regularized Preference Optimization (RPO). Experiments of aligning LLMs demonstrate the improved performance of RPO compared with DPO baselines. Our work sheds light on the interplay between preference optimization and SFT in tuning LLMs with both theoretical guarantees and empirical evidence.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by The Thirty-Eighth Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems. 31 pages, 7 figures</p></details> |
| **[Continual SFT Matches Multimodal RLHF with Negative Supervision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14797v1)** | 2024-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal RLHF usually happens after supervised finetuning (SFT) stage to continually improve vision-language models' (VLMs) comprehension. Conventional wisdom holds its superiority over continual SFT during this preference alignment stage. In this paper, we observe that the inherent value of multimodal RLHF lies in its negative supervision, the logit of the rejected responses. We thus propose a novel negative supervised finetuning (nSFT) approach that fully excavates these information resided. Our nSFT disentangles this negative supervision in RLHF paradigm, and continually aligns VLMs with a simple SFT loss. This is more memory efficient than multimodal RLHF where 2 (e.g., DPO) or 4 (e.g., PPO) large VLMs are strictly required. The effectiveness of nSFT is rigorously proved by comparing it with various multimodal RLHF approaches, across different dataset sources, base VLMs and evaluation metrics. Besides, fruitful of ablations are provided to support our hypothesis. We hope this paper will stimulate further research to properly align large vision language models.</p></details> |  |

However, to enhance its utility and reduce potential harm, SFT and alignment are applied sequentially to the pretrained model. Due to the differing nature and objective functions of SFT and alignment, catastrophic forgetting has become a significant issue. To address this, we introduce Unified Fine-Tuning (UFT), which integrates SFT and alignment into a single training stage using the same objective and loss functions through an implicit reward function. Our experimental results demonstrate that UFT outperforms SFT on instruction-tuning data alone. Moreover, when combining instruction-tuning data with alignment data, UFT effectively prevents catastrophic forgetting across these two stages and shows a clear advantage over sequentially applying SFT and alignment. This is evident in the significant improvements observed in the \textbf{ifeval} task for instruction-following and the \textbf{truthful-qa} task for factuality. The proposed general fine-tuning framework UFT establishes an effective and efficient pretraining-UFT paradigm for LLM training.</p></details> |  |
| **[Getting More Juice Out of the SFT Data: Reward Learning from Human Demonstration Improves SFT for LLM Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17888v3)** | 2024-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aligning human preference and value is an important requirement for contemporary foundation models. State-of-the-art techniques such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) often consist of two stages: 1) supervised fine-tuning (SFT), where the model is fine-tuned by learning from human demonstration data; 2) Preference learning, where preference data is used to learn a reward model, which is in turn used by a reinforcement learning (RL) step to fine-tune the model. Such reward model serves as a proxy to human preference, and it is critical to guide the RL step towards improving the model quality. In this work, we argue that the SFT stage significantly benefits from learning a reward model as well. Instead of using the human demonstration data directly via supervised learning, we propose to leverage an Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) technique to simultaneously build an reward model and a policy model. This approach leads to new SFT algorithms that are not only efficient to implement, but are robust to the presence of low-quality supervised learning data. Moreover, we discover a connection between the proposed IRL based approach, and a recent line of works called Self-Play Fine-tune (SPIN). Theoretically, we show that the proposed algorithms converge to the stationary solutions of the IRL problem. Empirically, we align 1B and 7B models using proposed methods and evaluate them on a reward benchmark model and the HuggingFace Open LLM Leaderboard. The proposed methods show significant performance improvement over existing SFT approaches. Our results indicate that it is beneficial to leverage reward learning throughout the entire alignment process.</p></details> |  |

The paradigm contains supervised fine tuning and reinforce learning from human feedback. This paradigm is also used in downstream scenarios to adapt LLM to specific corpora and applications. Comparing to SFT, there are many efforts focused on RLHF and several algorithms being proposed, such as PPO, DPO, IPO, KTO, MinorDPO and etc. Meanwhile most efforts for SFT are focused on how to collect, filter and mix high quality data. In this article with insight from DPO and MinorDPO, we propose a training metric for SFT to measure the discrepancy between the optimized model and the original model, and a loss function MinorSFT that can increase the training effectiveness, and reduce the discrepancy between the optimized LLM and original LLM.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |

However, sourcing this data through human annotation is costly, and existing automated methods often fail to capture the diverse range of contextual granularity and tend to produce homogeneous data. To tackle these issues, we introduce a novel method named AugCon, capable of automatically generating context-driven SFT data across multiple levels of granularity with high diversity, quality and fidelity. AugCon begins by generating queries using the Context-Split-Tree (CST), an innovative approach for recursively deriving queries and splitting context to cover full granularity. Then, we train a scorer through contrastive learning to collaborate with CST to rank and refine queries. Finally, a synergistic integration of self-alignment and self-improving is introduced to obtain high-fidelity responses. Extensive experiments are conducted incorporating both human and automatic evaluations, encompassing a test scenario and four widely-used benchmarks in English and Chinese. The results highlight the significant advantages of AugCon in producing high diversity, quality, and fidelity SFT data against several state-of-the-art methods. All of our code, dataset, and fine-tuned model will be available at: https://github.com/quanshr/AugCon.</p></details> |  |

It typically consists of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) stages. However, RLHF faces inherent limitations stemming from a complex training setup and its tendency to align the model with implicit values that end users cannot control at run-time. Moreover, reward models in RLHF stage commonly rely on single-dimensional feedback as opposed to explicit, multifaceted signals that indicate attributes such as helpfulness, humor, and toxicity. To address these limitations, we propose SteerLM, a supervised fine-tuning method that empowers end-users to control responses during inference. SteerLM conditions responses to conform to an explicitly defined multi-dimensional set of attributes, thereby empowering a steerable AI capable of generating helpful and high-quality responses while maintaining customizability. Experiments show that SteerLM trained on open source datasets generates responses that are preferred by human and automatic evaluators to many state-of-the-art baselines trained with RLHF while being much easier to train.

However, as the number of cascades increases, the improvements in reconstruction tend to become marginal, indicating possible excess model capacity. Knowledge distillation (KD) is an emerging technique to compress these models, in which a trained deep teacher network is used to distill knowledge to a smaller student network such that the student learns to mimic the behavior of the teacher. Most KD methods focus on effectively training the student with a pre-trained teacher unaware of the student model. We propose SFT-KD-Recon, a student-friendly teacher training approach along with the student as a prior step to KD to make the teacher aware of the structure and capacity of the student and enable aligning the representations of the teacher with the student. In SFT, the teacher is jointly trained with the unfolded branch configurations of the student blocks using three loss terms - teacher-reconstruction loss, student-reconstruction loss, and teacher-student imitation loss, followed by KD of the student. We perform extensive experiments for MRI acceleration in 4x and 5x under-sampling on the brain and cardiac datasets on five KD methods using the proposed approach as a prior step. We consider the DC-CNN architecture and setup teacher as D5C5 (141765 parameters), and student as D3C5 (49285 parameters), denoting a compression of 2.87:1. Results show that (i) our approach consistently improves the KD methods with improved reconstruction performance and image quality, and (ii) the student distilled using our approach is competitive with the teacher, with the performance gap reduced from 0.53 dB to 0.03 dB.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 8 figures.

Our proof is based on a structural theorem by Whyte and on two constructions of strongly aperiodic SFTs on $\mathbb{F}_n\times \mathbb{Z}$ and $BS(m,n)$ of our own. Our two constructions rely on a path-folding technique that lifts an SFT on $\mathbb{Z}^2$ inside an SFT on $\mathbb{F}_n\times \mathbb{Z}$ or an SFT on the hyperbolic plane inside an SFT on $BS(m,n)$. In the case of $\mathbb{F}_n\times \mathbb{Z}$ the path folding technique also preserves minimality, so that we get minimal strongly aperiodic SFTs on unimodular GBS groups.</p></details> | 31 pages, 13 figures |

As a consequence, if $P$ contains a recursive member, $P$ and $X$ have the exact same set of Turing degrees.

While performant, this paradigm is computationally inefficient. Inspired by classical deep RL literature, we propose separating generation and learning in RLHF. This enables asynchronous generation of new samples while simultaneously training on old samples, leading to faster training and more compute-optimal scaling. However, asynchronous training relies on an underexplored regime, online but off-policy RLHF: learning on samples from previous iterations of our model which give a worse training signal. We tackle the fundamental challenge in this regime: how much off-policyness can we tolerate for asynchronous training to speed up learning but maintain performance? Among several RLHF algorithms we test, online DPO is found to be most robust to off-policy data, and robustness increases with the scale of the policy model. We study further compute optimizations for asynchronous RLHF but find that they come at a performance cost, giving rise to a trade-off. We verify the scalability of asynchronous RLHF by training a general-purpose chatbot from LLaMA 3.1 8B on an instruction-following task ~40% faster than a synchronous run while matching final performance. Finally, we extend our results to math and reasoning to demonstrate asynchronous RL can finetune Rho 1B on GSM8k ~70% faster while matching synchronous accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>code ...</summary><p>code at https://github.com/mnoukhov/async_rlhf</p></details> |

However, the effectiveness of RLHF in addressing underlying biases remains unclear. This study investigates the relationship between RLHF and both covert and overt biases in LLMs, particularly focusing on biases against African Americans. We applied various RLHF techniques (DPO, ORPO, and RLOO) to Llama 3 8B and evaluated the covert and overt biases of the resulting models using matched-guise probing and explicit bias testing. We performed additional tests with DPO on different base models and datasets; among several implications, we found that SFT before RLHF calcifies model biases. Additionally, we extend the tools for measuring biases to multi-modal models. Through our experiments we collect evidence that indicates that current alignment techniques are inadequate for nebulous tasks such as mitigating covert biases, highlighting the need for capable datasets, data curating techniques, or alignment tools.</p></details> |  |

However, their iterative sampling process leads to slow generation and inefficient training, challenges that are further exacerbated when incorporating Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) due to sparse rewards and long time horizons. Consistency models address these issues by enabling single-step or efficient multi-step generation, significantly reducing computational costs. In this work, we propose a direct reward optimization framework for applying RLHF to consistency models, incorporating distributional regularization to enhance training stability and prevent reward hacking. We investigate various $f$-divergences as regularization strategies, striking a balance between reward maximization and model consistency. Unlike policy gradient methods, our approach leverages first-order gradients, making it more efficient and less sensitive to hyperparameter tuning. Empirical results show that our method achieves competitive or superior performance compared to policy gradient based RLHF methods, across various automatic metrics and human evaluation. Additionally, our analysis demonstrates the impact of different regularization techniques in improving model generalization and preventing overfitting.</p></details> |  |

DIL provides a unified imitation learning perspective on alignment, encompassing existing alignment algorithms as special cases while naturally introducing new variants. By bridging IL and RLHF, DIL offers new insights into alignment with RLHF.

These platforms enable users to fine-tune models without requiring any expertise in developing complex machine learning algorithms. While these platforms offer useful features such as reward modeling and RLHF fine-tuning, their security and reliability remain largely unexplored. Given the growing adoption of RLHF and open-source RLHF frameworks, we investigate the trustworthiness of these systems and their potential impact on behavior of LLMs. In this paper, we present an attack targeting publicly available RLHF tools. In our proposed attack, an adversarial RLHF platform corrupts the LLM alignment process by selectively manipulating data samples in the preference dataset. In this scenario, when a user's task aligns with the attacker's objective, the platform manipulates a subset of the preference dataset that contains samples related to the attacker's target. This manipulation results in a corrupted reward model, which ultimately leads to the misalignment of the language model. Our results demonstrate that such an attack can effectively steer LLMs toward undesirable behaviors within the targeted domains. Our work highlights the critical need to explore the vulnerabilities of RLHF platforms and their potential to cause misalignment in LLMs during the RLHF fine-tuning process.</p></details> |  |
| **[Taming Overconfidence in LLMs: Reward Calibration in RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09724v2)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language model calibration refers to the alignment between the confidence of the model and the actual performance of its responses. While previous studies point out the overconfidence phenomenon in Large Language Models (LLMs) and show that LLMs trained with Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) are overconfident with a more sharpened output probability, in this study, we reveal that RLHF tends to lead models to express verbalized overconfidence in their own responses. We investigate the underlying cause of this overconfidence and demonstrate that reward models used for Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) exhibit inherent biases towards high-confidence scores regardless of the actual quality of responses. Building upon this insight, we propose two PPO variants: PPO-M: PPO with Calibrated Reward Modeling and PPO-C: PPO with Calibrated Reward Calculation. PPO-M integrates explicit confidence scores in reward model training, which calibrates reward models to better capture the alignment between response quality and verbalized confidence. PPO-C adjusts the reward score during PPO based on the difference between the current reward and the exponential average of past rewards. Both PPO-M and PPO-C can be seamlessly integrated into the current PPO pipeline and do not require additional golden labels. We evaluate our methods on both Llama3-8B and Mistral-7B across six diverse datasets including multiple-choice and open-ended generation. Experimental results demonstrate that both of our methods can reduce calibration error and maintain performance comparable to standard PPO. We further show that they could preserve model capabilities in open-ended conversational settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reward Shaping to Mitigate Reward Hacking in RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18770v2)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is essential for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values. However, RLHF is susceptible to reward hacking, where the agent exploits flaws in the reward function rather than learning the intended behavior, thus degrading alignment. While reward shaping helps stabilize RLHF and partially mitigate reward hacking, a systematic investigation into shaping techniques and their underlying principles remains lacking. To bridge this gap, we present a comprehensive study of the prevalent reward shaping methods. Our analysis suggests three key design principles: (1) RL reward is ideally bounded, (2) RL benefits from rapid initial growth followed by gradual convergence, and (3) RL reward is best formulated as a function of centered reward. Guided by these insights, we propose Preference As Reward (PAR), a novel approach that leverages the latent preferences embedded within the reward model itself as the signal for reinforcement learning. We evaluated PAR on two base models, Gemma2-2B and Llama3-8B, using two datasets, Ultrafeedback-Binarized and HH-RLHF. Experimental results demonstrate PAR's superior performance over other reward shaping methods. On the AlpacaEval 2.0 benchmark, PAR achieves a win rate at least 5 percentage points higher than competing approaches. Furthermore, PAR exhibits remarkable data efficiency, requiring only a single reference reward for optimal performance, and maintains robustness against reward hacking even after two full epochs of training.

| **[Can RLHF be More Efficient with Imperfect Reward Models? A Policy Coverage Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19255v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sample efficiency is critical for online Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). While existing works investigate sample-efficient online exploration strategies, the potential of utilizing misspecified yet relevant reward models to accelerate learning remains underexplored. This paper studies how to transfer knowledge from those imperfect reward models in online RLHF. We start by identifying a novel property of the KL-regularized RLHF objective: \emph{a policy's ability to cover the optimal policy is captured by its sub-optimality}. Building on this insight, we propose a theoretical transfer learning algorithm with provable benefits compared to standard online learning. Our approach achieves low regret in the early stage by quickly adapting to the best available source reward models without prior knowledge of their quality, and over time, it attains an $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret bound \emph{independent} of structural complexity measures. Inspired by our theoretical findings, we develop an empirical algorithm with improved computational efficiency, and demonstrate its effectiveness empirically in summarization tasks.</p></details> | 35 Pages |
| **[Evaluating Defences against Unsafe Feedback in RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12914v3)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While there has been progress towards aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human values and ensuring safe behaviour at inference time, safety guards can easily be removed when fine tuned on unsafe and harmful datasets. While this setting has been treated extensively, another popular training paradigm, learning from unsafe feedback with reinforcement learning, has previously been unexplored. This is concerning due to the widespread deployment of feedback collection systems. We address this gap by providing an analysis of learning settings where feedback is harmful, i.e. that unsafe samples are preferred over safe ones despite model developers goal to maintain safety. We find that safety-aligned LLMs easily explore unsafe action spaces via generating harmful text and optimize for reward that violates safety constraints indicating that current safety guards are not enough to prevent learning from unsafe feedback. In order to protect against this vulnerability, we adapt a number of both "implict" and "explicit" harmful fine-tuning defences to evaluate whether they are effective as learning constraints in an RLHF setting finding that no method is generally effective pointing to the need for more defence research. We end the paper with the observation that some defences work by performing "harmless reward hacking" for which we provide a theoretical explanation drawn from the theory of Constrained Markov Decision Processes and provide some direction for future defence development.</p></details> |  |
| **[Projection Optimization: A General Framework for Multi-Objective and Multi-Group RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15145v2)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) is a widely used fine-tuning approach that aligns machine learning model, particularly Language Model (LM) with human preferences. There are typically multiple objectives driving the preference, hence humans find it easier to express per-objective comparisons rather than a global preference between two choices. Multi-Objective RLHF (MORLHF) aims to use per-objective preference feedback and achieve Pareto optimality among these objectives by aggregating them into a single unified objective for optimization. However, nearly all prior works rely on linear aggregation, which rules out policies that favor specific objectives such as the worst one. The only existing approach using non-linear aggregation is computationally expensive due to its reward-based nature and the need for retraining whenever the aggregation parameters change. In this work, we address this limitation by transforming the non-linear aggregation maximization problem into a series of sub-problems. Each sub-problem involves only linear aggregation, making it computationally efficient to solve. We further extend our framework to handle multi-group scenarios, where each group has distinct weights for the objectives. Our method enables achieving consensus or maximizing the aggregated objective across all groups. Theoretically, we demonstrate that our algorithmic framework achieves sublinear regret and can be easily adapted to a reward-free algorithm. Empirically, leveraging our theoretical insights, we propose a nearly training-free algorithm once the optimal policies for individual objectives are obtained.</p></details> |  |
| **[Simplify RLHF as Reward-Weighted SFT: A Variational Method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11026v2)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is crucial for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human values. However, RLHF has been continuously challenged by its high complexity in implementation and computation consumption. Even with recent simplifications, such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Advantage Leftover Lunch (A-LoL), the problems of over-fitting and training instability remain hindering the alignment process from the expected optimal performance. To address the existing challenges, we propose a novel simplification of RLHF from the perspective of variational inference, called $\textbf{V}$ariational $\textbf{A}$lignment with $\textbf{R}$e-weighting ($\textbf{VAR}$). More specifically, by directly minimizing the distribution gap between the learning LLM policy and the optimal solution of RLHF, we transform the alignment objective into a reward-driven re-weighted supervised fine-tuning (SFT) form, which only requires minor adjustment on the SFT loss to obtain noticeable improvement on training stability and effectiveness. On comprehensive alignment and generation benchmarks, our VAR method has numerically achieved competitive performance in LLM alignment helpfulness and harmlessness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Value-Incentivized Preference Optimization: A Unified Approach to Online and Offline RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19320v4)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has demonstrated great promise in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preference. Depending on the availability of preference data, both online and offline RLHF are active areas of investigation. A key bottleneck is understanding how to incorporate uncertainty estimation in the reward function learned from the preference data for RLHF, regardless of how the preference data is collected. While the principles of optimism or pessimism under uncertainty are well-established in standard reinforcement learning (RL), a practically-implementable and theoretically-grounded form amenable to large language models is not yet available, as standard techniques for constructing confidence intervals become intractable under arbitrary policy parameterizations. In this paper, we introduce a unified approach to online and offline RLHF -- value-incentivized preference optimization (VPO) -- which regularizes the maximum-likelihood estimate of the reward function with the corresponding value function, modulated by a $\textit{sign}$ to indicate whether the optimism or pessimism is chosen. VPO also directly optimizes the policy with implicit reward modeling, and therefore shares a simpler RLHF pipeline similar to direct preference optimization. Theoretical guarantees of VPO are provided for both online and offline settings, matching the rates of their standard RL counterparts. Moreover, experiments on text summarization and dialog verify the practicality and effectiveness of VPO.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

It has been shown to enhance both generation quality and trustworthiness. While numerous works have focused on improving retrieval, generation, and evaluation, the role of reward models in reinforcement learning for optimizing RAG remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{RAG-Reward}, a framework designed to develop reward models to enable \textit{hallucination-free, comprehensive, reliable, and efficient RAG}. We define four key metrics to assess generation quality and develop an automated benchmarking pipeline to evaluate the outputs of multiple LLMs across a variety of RAG scenarios. Using \textbf{RAG-Reward}, we train reward models and apply {reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF)} to improve LLMs' effectiveness in RAG. Experimental results demonstrate that our reward model achieves state-of-the-art performance in automatic benchmarking and aligns closely with human evaluations. Furthermore, the improved generation quality of the trained policy model highlights the feasibility and efficiency of using RLHF to enhance RAG outputs.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Equilibrate RLHF: Towards Balancing Helpfulness-Safety Trade-off in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11555v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) based on human preferences, commonly achieved through reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), has been effective in improving their performance. However, maintaining LLM safety throughout the fine-tuning process remains a significant challenge, as resolving conflicts between safety and helpfulness can be non-trivial. Typically, the safety alignment of LLM is trained on data with safety-related categories. However, our experiments find that naively increasing the scale of safety training data usually leads the LLMs to an ``overly safe'' state rather than a ``truly safe'' state, boosting the refusal rate through extensive safety-aligned data without genuinely understanding the requirements for safe responses. Such an approach can inadvertently diminish the models' helpfulness. To understand the phenomenon, we first investigate the role of safety data by categorizing them into three different groups, and observe that each group behaves differently as training data scales up. To boost the balance between safety and helpfulness, we propose an Equilibrate RLHF framework including a Fine-grained Data-centric (FDC) approach that achieves better safety alignment even with fewer training data, and an Adaptive Message-wise Alignment (AMA) approach, which selectively highlight the key segments through a gradient masking strategy. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances the safety alignment of LLMs while balancing safety and helpfulness.</p></details> |  |
| **[DPO Meets PPO: Reinforced Token Optimization for RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18922v3)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the classical Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) framework, Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is employed to learn from sparse, sentence-level rewards -- a challenging scenario in traditional deep reinforcement learning. Despite the great successes of PPO in the alignment of large language models, its open-source implementation is still largely sub-optimal. To address these issues, we introduce a framework that models RLHF problems as a Markov decision process (MDP), enabling the capture of fine-grained token-wise information. Under this framework, we introduce an algorithm Reinforced Token Optimization (\texttt{RTO}), which learns the token-wise reward function from preference data and performs policy optimization based on this learned token-wise reward signal. Theoretically, \texttt{RTO} is proven to have the capability of finding the near-optimal policy sample-efficiently. For its practical implementation, \texttt{RTO} innovatively integrates Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and PPO. DPO, originally derived from sparse sentence rewards, surprisingly provides us with a token-wise characterization of response quality, which is seamlessly incorporated into our subsequent PPO training stage. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \texttt{RTO} performs better than PPO and other direct preference learning algorithms. In particular, RTO outperforms PPO by 7.5 points on the AlpacaEval 2 benchmark and by 4.1 points on Arena-Hard. Our code and models are available at \href{https://github.com/zkshan2002/RTO}{https://github.com/zkshan2002/RTO}.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sharp Analysis for KL-Regularized Contextual Bandits and RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04625v2)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reverse-Kullback-Leibler (KL) regularization has emerged to be a predominant technique used to enhance policy optimization in reinforcement learning (RL) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), which forces the learned policy to stay close to a reference policy. While the effectiveness and necessity of KL-regularization have been empirically demonstrated in various practical scenarios, current theoretical analysis of KL-regularized RLHF still obtains the same $\mathcal{O}(1 / \epsilon^2)$ sample complexity as problems without KL-regularization. To understand the fundamental distinction between policy learning objectives with KL-regularization and ones without KL-regularization, we are the first to theoretically demonstrate the power of KL-regularization by providing a sharp analysis for KL-regularized contextual bandits and RLHF, revealing an $\mathcal{O}(1 / \epsilon)$ sample complexity when $\epsilon$ is sufficiently small. We further explore the role of data coverage in contextual bandits and RLHF. While the coverage assumption is commonly employed in offline RLHF to link the samples from the reference policy to the optimal policy, often at the cost of a multiplicative dependence on the coverage coefficient, its impact on the sample complexity of online RLHF remains unclear. Previous theoretical analyses of online RLHF typically require explicit exploration and additional structural assumptions on the reward function class. In contrast, we show that with sufficient coverage from the reference policy, a simple two-stage mixed sampling strategy can achieve a sample complexity with only an additive dependence on the coverage coefficient. Our results provide a comprehensive understanding of the roles of KL-regularization and data coverage in RLHF, shedding light on the design of more efficient RLHF algorithms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Provably Efficient RLHF Pipeline: A Unified View from Contextual Bandits](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07193v1)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is a widely used approach for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences. While recent advancements have provided valuable insights into various stages and settings of RLHF, a comprehensive theoretical understanding of the entire RLHF pipeline remains lacking. Towards this end, we propose a unified framework for the RLHF pipeline from the view of contextual bandits and provide provable efficiency guarantees. In particular, we decompose the RLHF process into two distinct stages: (post-)training and deployment, exploring both passive and active data collection strategies during the training phase. By employing the Bradley-Terry preference model with a linearly parameterized reward function, we reformulate RLHF as a contextual preference bandit problem. We then develop novel algorithms for each stage, demonstrating significant improvements over existing approaches in both statistical and computational efficiency. Finally, we apply our method to train and deploy Llama-3-8B-Instruct on the Ultrafeedback-binarized dataset, and empirical results confirm the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[RLHS: Mitigating Misalignment in RLHF with Hindsight Simulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08617v2)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has shown promise in aligning generative AI, we present empirical evidence that it can also cause severe, systematic misalignment. We hypothesize that this stems from evaluator feedback depending on downstream outcome predictions (foresight) that can be influenced by the AI's output, inducing Goodhart's law dynamics. Conversely, our theoretical analysis shows that conditioning evaluator feedback on downstream observations (hindsight) inhibits this effect by decoupling the alignment signal from potentially compromised predictions-crucially, the result holds even if the observed outcomes are sampled from the AI's own world model. Building on this insight, we introduce Reinforcement Learning from Hindsight Simulation (RLHS), which presents plausible simulated outcomes to evaluators before eliciting feedback. We demonstrate RLHS on online (PPO) and offline (DPO) large language model fine-tuning, obtaining superior alignment over RLHF in controlled consultancy-type experiments and user studies. We evaluate post-hoc on the TruthfulQA benchmark and find that, even after single-task fine-tuning, both RLHF misalignment and RLHS alignment carry over to substantially different settings.</p></details> | 24 pages, 18 figures |
| **[Avoiding $\mathbf{exp(R_{max})}$ scaling in RLHF through Preference-based Exploration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00666v2)** | 2025-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a pivotal technique for large language model (LLM) alignment. This paper studies the setting of online RLHF and focus on improving sample efficiency. All existing algorithms in online RLHF, whether doing passive exploration or active exploration, suffer from a sample complexity that scales exponentially with the scale of the reward function. This fundamental limitation hinders their effectiveness in scenarios with heavily skewed preferences, e.g. questions with a unique correct solution. To address this, we introduce Self-Exploring Preference-Incentive Online Preference Optimization (SE-POPO), an online RLHF algorithm that for the first time achieves a sample complexity that scales polynomially with the reward scale, answering an open problem raised by Xie et al. (2024).. Theoretically, we demonstrate that the sample complexity of SE-POPO dominates that of existing exploration algorithms. Empirically, our systematic evaluation confirms that SE-POPO is more sample-efficient than both exploratory and non-exploratory baselines, in two primary application scenarios of RLHF as well as on public benchmarks, marking a significant step forward in RLHF algorithm design. The code is available at https://github.com/MYC000801/SE-POPO.</p></details> |  |
| **[Influencing Humans to Conform to Preference Models for RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06416v2)** | 2025-02-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Designing a reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) algorithm to approximate a human's unobservable reward function requires assuming, implicitly or explicitly, a model of human preferences. A preference model that poorly describes how humans generate preferences risks learning a poor approximation of the human's reward function. In this paper, we conduct three human studies to asses whether one can influence the expression of real human preferences to more closely conform to a desired preference model. Importantly, our approach does not seek to alter the human's unobserved reward function. Rather, we change how humans use this reward function to generate preferences, such that they better match whatever preference model is assumed by a particular RLHF algorithm. We introduce three interventions: showing humans the quantities that underlie a preference model, which is normally unobservable information derived from the reward function; training people to follow a specific preference model; and modifying the preference elicitation question. All intervention types show significant effects, providing practical tools to improve preference data quality and the resultant alignment of the learned reward functions. Overall we establish a novel research direction in model alignment: designing interfaces and training interventions to increase human conformance with the modeling assumptions of the algorithm that will learn from their input.</p></details> |  |

We introduce Federated Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (FedRLHF), a novel framework that decentralizes the RLHF process. FedRLHF enables collaborative policy learning across multiple clients without necessitating the sharing of raw data or human feedback, thereby ensuring robust privacy preservation. Leveraging federated reinforcement learning, each client integrates human feedback locally into their reward functions and updates their policies through personalized RLHF processes. We establish rigorous theoretical foundations for FedRLHF, providing convergence guarantees, and deriving sample complexity bounds that scale efficiently with the number of clients. Empirical evaluations on the MovieLens and IMDb datasets demonstrate that FedRLHF not only preserves user privacy but also achieves performance on par with centralized RLHF, while enhancing personalization across diverse client environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Updated for AAMAS 2025 camera-ready.

| **[The Energy Loss Phenomenon in RLHF: A New Perspective on Mitigating Reward Hacking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19358v2)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work identifies the Energy Loss Phenomenon in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and its connection to reward hacking. Specifically, energy loss in the final layer of a Large Language Model (LLM) gradually increases during the RL process, with an excessive increase in energy loss characterizing reward hacking. Beyond empirical analysis, we further provide a theoretical foundation by proving that, under mild conditions, the increased energy loss reduces the upper bound of contextual relevance in LLMs, which is a critical aspect of reward hacking as the reduced contextual relevance typically indicates overfitting to reward model-favored patterns in RL. To address this issue, we propose an Energy loss-aware PPO algorithm (EPPO) which penalizes the increase in energy loss in the LLM's final layer during reward calculation to prevent excessive energy loss, thereby mitigating reward hacking. We theoretically show that EPPO can be conceptually interpreted as an entropy-regularized RL algorithm, which provides deeper insights into its effectiveness. Extensive experiments across various LLMs and tasks demonstrate the commonality of the energy loss phenomenon, as well as the effectiveness of EPPO in mitigating reward hacking and improving RLHF performance.</p></details> | 28 pages, 21 figures |
| **[Theoretical Analysis of KL-regularized RLHF with Multiple Reference Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01203v1)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent methods for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human feedback predominantly rely on a single reference model, which limits diversity, model overfitting, and underutilizes the wide range of available pre-trained models. Incorporating multiple reference models has the potential to address these limitations by broadening perspectives, reducing bias, and leveraging the strengths of diverse open-source LLMs. However, integrating multiple reference models into reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) frameworks poses significant theoretical challenges, particularly in reverse KL-regularization, where achieving exact solutions has remained an open problem. This paper presents the first \emph{exact solution} to the multiple reference model problem in reverse KL-regularized RLHF. We introduce a comprehensive theoretical framework that includes rigorous statistical analysis and provides sample complexity guarantees. Additionally, we extend our analysis to forward KL-regularized RLHF, offering new insights into sample complexity requirements in multiple reference scenarios. Our contributions lay the foundation for more advanced and adaptable LLM alignment techniques, enabling the effective use of multiple reference models. This work paves the way for developing alignment frameworks that are both theoretically sound and better suited to the challenges of modern AI ecosystems.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[Towards Federated RLHF with Aggregated Client Preference for LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03038v2)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) fine-tunes a pretrained large language model (LLM) using user preference data, enabling it to generate content aligned with human preferences. However, due to privacy concerns, users may be reluctant to share sensitive preference data. To address this, we propose utilizing Federated Learning (FL) techniques, allowing large-scale preference collection from diverse real-world users without requiring them to transmit data to a central server. Our federated RLHF methods (i.e., FedBis and FedBiscuit) encode each client's preferences into binary selectors and aggregate them to capture common preferences. In particular, FedBiscuit overcomes key challenges, such as preference heterogeneity and reward hacking, through innovative solutions like grouping clients with similar preferences to reduce heterogeneity and using multiple binary selectors to enhance LLM output quality. To evaluate the performance of the proposed methods, we establish the first federated RLHF benchmark with a heterogeneous human preference dataset. Experimental results show that by integrating the LLM with aggregated client preferences, FedBis and FedBiscuit significantly enhance the professionalism and readability of the generated content.</p></details> | ICLR'25 |
| **[Segmenting Text and Learning Their Rewards for Improved RLHF in Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02790v1)** | 2025-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has been widely adopted to align language models (LMs) with human preference. Prior RLHF works typically take a bandit formulation, which, though intuitive, ignores the sequential nature of LM generation and can suffer from the sparse reward issue. While recent works propose dense token-level RLHF, treating each token as an action may be oversubtle to proper reward assignment. In this paper, we seek to get the best of both by training and utilizing a segment-level reward model, which assigns a reward to each semantically complete text segment that spans over a short sequence of tokens. For reward learning, our method allows dynamic text segmentation and compatibility with standard sequence-preference datasets. For effective RL-based LM training against segment reward, we generalize the classical scalar bandit reward normalizers into location-aware normalizer functions and interpolate the segment reward for further densification. With these designs, our method performs competitively on three popular RLHF benchmarks for LM policy: AlpacaEval 2.0, Arena-Hard, and MT-Bench. Ablation studies are conducted to further demonstrate our method.</p></details> |  |

Automatic Analysis of Refusal Composition in IFT/RLHF Datasets and Refusal Behavior of Black-Box LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16974v1)** | 2024-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Refusals - instances where large language models (LLMs) decline or fail to fully execute user instructions - are crucial for both AI safety and AI capabilities and the reduction of hallucinations in particular. These behaviors are learned during post-training, especially in instruction fine-tuning (IFT) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). However, existing taxonomies and evaluation datasets for refusals are inadequate, often focusing solely on should-not-related (instead of cannot-related) categories, and lacking tools for auditing refusal content in black-box LLM outputs. We present a comprehensive framework for classifying LLM refusals: (a) a taxonomy of 16 refusal categories, (b) a human-annotated dataset of over 8,600 instances from publicly available IFT and RLHF datasets, (c) a synthetic dataset with 8,000 examples for each refusal category, and (d) classifiers trained for refusal classification. Our work enables precise auditing of refusal behaviors in black-box LLMs and automatic analyses of refusal patterns in large IFT and RLHF datasets. This facilitates the strategic adjustment of LLM refusals, contributing to the development of more safe and reliable LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024 Workshop SFLLM</p></details> |

On The Impact of Preference Alignment On Trustworthiness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18870v2)** | 2024-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The trustworthiness of Large Language Models (LLMs) refers to the extent to which their outputs are reliable, safe, and ethically aligned, and it has become a crucial consideration alongside their cognitive performance. In practice, Reinforcement Learning From Human Feedback (RLHF) has been widely used to align LLMs with labeled human preferences, but its assumed effect on model trustworthiness hasn't been rigorously evaluated. To bridge this knowledge gap, this study investigates how models aligned with general-purpose preference data perform across five trustworthiness verticals: toxicity, stereotypical bias, machine ethics, truthfulness, and privacy. Our results demonstrate that RLHF on human preferences doesn't automatically guarantee trustworthiness, and reverse effects are often observed. Furthermore, we propose to adapt efficient influence function based data attribution methods to the RLHF setting to better understand the influence of fine-tuning data on individual trustworthiness benchmarks, and show its feasibility by providing our estimated attribution scores. Together, our results underscore the need for more nuanced approaches for model alignment from both the data and framework perspectives, and we hope this research will guide the community towards developing language models that are increasingly capable without sacrificing trustworthiness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Solving the Inverse Alignment Problem for Efficient RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10529v1)** | 2024-12-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Collecting high-quality preference datasets for reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is resource-intensive and challenging. As a result, researchers often train reward models on extensive offline datasets which aggregate diverse generation sources and scoring/alignment policies. We hypothesize that this aggregation has an averaging effect on reward model scores, which limits signal and impairs the alignment process. Inspired by the field of inverse RL, we define the 'inverse alignment problem' in language model training, where our objective is to optimize the critic's reward for a fixed actor and a fixed offline preference dataset. We hypothesize that solving the inverse alignment problem will improve reward model quality by providing clearer feedback on the policy's current behavior. To that end, we investigate whether repeatedly fine-tuning a reward model on subsets of the offline preference dataset aligned with a periodically frozen policy during RLHF improves upon vanilla RLHF. Our empirical results demonstrate that this approach facilitates superior alignment and faster convergence compared to using an unaligned or out-of-distribution reward model relative to the LLM policy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Policy Filtration in RLHF to Fine-Tune LLM for Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06957v2)** | 2024-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is one of the key techniques that helps large language models (LLMs) to follow instructions and provide helpful and harmless responses. While direct policy optimization methods exist, state-of-the-art LLMs adopt RL-based methods (usually PPO) in RLHF to train the policy to generate good responses guided by a reward model learned from preference data. The main challenge of these methods is the inaccuracy of the intermediate reward model, especially in code generation tasks that require long and complex reasoning to score a response. We find that the reliability of the reward model varies across responses assigned with different rewards. This motivates us to filter the samples whose rewards may be unreliable to improve signal-to-noise ratio during policy learning, resulting in Policy Filtration for Proximal Policy Optimization (PF-PPO). To choose a proper policy filtration strategy for a given reward model, the coefficient of determination ($R^2$) between rewards and actual scores on filtered samples serves as a good metrics and helps us find several promising strategies. We provide extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of PF-PPO in code generation tasks, and find that some variants of PF-PPO are highly effective and achieve new state-of-the-art performance across 7-billion-parameter models on HumanEval, MBPP, and a new and more challenging LeetCode Contest benchmark.</p></details> |  |
| **[Does RLHF Scale? Exploring the Impacts From Data, Model, and Method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06000v1)** | 2024-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study explores the scaling properties of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) in Large Language Models (LLMs). Although RLHF is considered an important step in post-training of LLMs, its scaling potential is still largely unknown. We systematically analyze key components in the RLHF framework--model size, data composition, and inference budget--and their impacts on performance. Our findings show that increasing data diversity and volume improves reward model performance, helping process-supervision models scale better. For policy training, more response samples per prompt boost performance initially but quickly plateau. And larger reward models offer modest gains in policy training. In addition, larger policy models benefit less from RLHF with a fixed reward model. Overall, RLHF scales less efficiently than pretraining, with diminishing returns from additional computational resources. Based on these observations, we propose strategies to optimize RLHF performance within computational limits.</p></details> |  |
| **[Language Models Learn to Mislead Humans via RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12822v3)** | 2024-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language models (LMs) can produce errors that are hard to detect for humans, especially when the task is complex. RLHF, the most popular post-training method, may exacerbate this problem: to achieve higher rewards, LMs might get better at convincing humans that they are right even when they are wrong. We study this phenomenon under a standard RLHF pipeline, calling it "U-SOPHISTRY" since it is Unintended by model developers. Specifically, we ask time-constrained (e.g., 3-10 minutes) human subjects to evaluate the correctness of model outputs and calculate humans' accuracy against gold labels. On a question-answering task (QuALITY) and programming task (APPS), RLHF makes LMs better at convincing our subjects but not at completing the task correctly. RLHF also makes the model harder to evaluate: our subjects' false positive rate increases by 24.1% on QuALITY and 18.3% on APPS. Finally, we show that probing, a state-of-the-art approach for detecting Intended Sophistry (e.g. backdoored LMs), does not generalize to U-SOPHISTRY. Our results highlight an important failure mode of RLHF and call for more research in assisting humans to align them.</p></details> |  |
| **[Provably Mitigating Overoptimization in RLHF: Your SFT Loss is Implicitly an Adversarial Regularizer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16436v3)** | 2024-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aligning generative models with human preference via RLHF typically suffers from overoptimization, where an imperfectly learned reward model can misguide the generative model to output undesired responses. We investigate this problem in a principled manner by identifying the source of the misalignment as a form of distributional shift and uncertainty in learning human preferences. To mitigate overoptimization, we first propose a theoretical algorithm that chooses the best policy for an adversarially chosen reward model; one that simultaneously minimizes the maximum likelihood estimation of the loss and a reward penalty term. Here, the reward penalty term is introduced to prevent the policy from choosing actions with spurious high proxy rewards, resulting in provable sample efficiency of the algorithm under a partial coverage style condition. Moving from theory to practice, the proposed algorithm further enjoys an equivalent but surprisingly easy-to-implement reformulation. Using the equivalence between reward models and the corresponding optimal policy, the algorithm features a simple objective that combines: (i) a preference optimization loss that directly aligns the policy with human preference, and (ii) a supervised learning loss that explicitly imitates the policy with a (suitable) baseline distribution. In the context of aligning large language models (LLM), this objective fuses the direct preference optimization (DPO) loss with the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) loss to help mitigate the overoptimization towards undesired responses, for which we name the algorithm Regularized Preference Optimization (RPO). Experiments of aligning LLMs demonstrate the improved performance of RPO compared with DPO baselines. Our work sheds light on the interplay between preference optimization and SFT in tuning LLMs with both theoretical guarantees and empirical evidence.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by The Thirty-Eighth Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems. 31 pages, 7 figures</p></details> |

However, unlike pretraining or fine-tuning a single model, scaling reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) for training large language models poses coordination challenges across four models. We present OpenRLHF, an open-source framework enabling efficient RLHF scaling. Unlike existing RLHF frameworks that co-locate four models on the same GPUs, OpenRLHF re-designs scheduling for the models beyond 70B parameters using Ray, vLLM, and DeepSpeed, leveraging improved resource utilization and diverse training approaches. Integrating seamlessly with Hugging Face, OpenRLHF provides an out-of-the-box solution with optimized algorithms and launch scripts, which ensures user-friendliness. OpenRLHF implements RLHF, DPO, rejection sampling, and other alignment techniques. Empowering state-of-the-art LLM development, OpenRLHF's code is available at \url{https://github.com/OpenRLHF/OpenRLHF}.</p></details> |  |
| **[Continual SFT Matches Multimodal RLHF with Negative Supervision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14797v1)** | 2024-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal RLHF usually happens after supervised finetuning (SFT) stage to continually improve vision-language models' (VLMs) comprehension. Conventional wisdom holds its superiority over continual SFT during this preference alignment stage. In this paper, we observe that the inherent value of multimodal RLHF lies in its negative supervision, the logit of the rejected responses. We thus propose a novel negative supervised finetuning (nSFT) approach that fully excavates these information resided. Our nSFT disentangles this negative supervision in RLHF paradigm, and continually aligns VLMs with a simple SFT loss. This is more memory efficient than multimodal RLHF where 2 (e.g., DPO) or 4 (e.g., PPO) large VLMs are strictly required. The effectiveness of nSFT is rigorously proved by comparing it with various multimodal RLHF approaches, across different dataset sources, base VLMs and evaluation metrics. Besides, fruitful of ablations are provided to support our hypothesis. We hope this paper will stimulate further research to properly align large vision language models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Value Imprint: A Technique for Auditing the Human Values Embedded in RLHF Datasets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11937v1)** | 2024-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs are increasingly fine-tuned using RLHF datasets to align them with human preferences and values. However, very limited research has investigated which specific human values are operationalized through these datasets. In this paper, we introduce Value Imprint, a framework for auditing and classifying the human values embedded within RLHF datasets. To investigate the viability of this framework, we conducted three case study experiments by auditing the Anthropic/hh-rlhf, OpenAI WebGPT Comparisons, and Alpaca GPT-4-LLM datasets to examine the human values embedded within them. Our analysis involved a two-phase process. During the first phase, we developed a taxonomy of human values through an integrated review of prior works from philosophy, axiology, and ethics. Then, we applied this taxonomy to annotate 6,501 RLHF preferences. During the second phase, we employed the labels generated from the annotation as ground truth data for training a transformer-based machine learning model to audit and classify the three RLHF datasets. Through this approach, we discovered that information-utility values, including Wisdom/Knowledge and Information Seeking, were the most dominant human values within all three RLHF datasets. In contrast, prosocial and democratic values, including Well-being, Justice, and Human/Animal Rights, were the least represented human values. These findings have significant implications for developing language models that align with societal values and norms. We contribute our datasets to support further research in this area.</p></details> |  |

However, existing open-source RLHF projects are still largely confined to the offline learning setting. In this technical report, we aim to fill in this gap and provide a detailed recipe that is easy to reproduce for online iterative RLHF. In particular, since online human feedback is usually infeasible for open-source communities with limited resources, we start by constructing preference models using a diverse set of open-source datasets and use the constructed proxy preference model to approximate human feedback. Then, we discuss the theoretical insights and algorithmic principles behind online iterative RLHF, followed by a detailed practical implementation. Our trained LLM achieves impressive performance on LLM chatbot benchmarks, including AlpacaEval-2, Arena-Hard, and MT-Bench, as well as other academic benchmarks such as HumanEval and TruthfulQA. We have shown that supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and iterative RLHF can obtain state-of-the-art performance with fully open-source datasets. Further, we have made our models, curated datasets, and comprehensive step-by-step code guidebooks publicly available.

| **[A Theoretical Framework for Partially Observed Reward-States in RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03282v3)** | 2024-11-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing deployment of reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) calls for a deeper theoretical investigation of its underlying models. The prevalent models of RLHF do not account for neuroscience-backed, partially-observed "internal states" that can affect human feedback, nor do they accommodate intermediate feedback during an interaction. Both of these can be instrumental in speeding up learning and improving alignment. To address these limitations, we model RLHF as reinforcement learning with partially observed reward-states (PORRL). We accommodate two kinds of feedback $-$ cardinal and dueling feedback. We first demonstrate that PORRL subsumes a wide class of RL problems, including traditional RL, RLHF, and reward machines. For cardinal feedback, we present two model-based methods (POR-UCRL, POR-UCBVI). We give both cardinal regret and sample complexity guarantees for the methods, showing that they improve over naive history-summarization. We then discuss the benefits of a model-free method like GOLF with naive history-summarization in settings with recursive internal states and dense intermediate feedback. For this purpose, we define a new history aware version of the Bellman-eluder dimension and give a new guarantee for GOLF in our setting, which can be exponentially sharper in illustrative examples. For dueling feedback, we show that a naive reduction to cardinal feedback fails to achieve sublinear dueling regret. We then present the first explicit reduction that converts guarantees for cardinal regret to dueling regret. In both feedback settings, we show that our models and guarantees generalize and extend existing ones.</p></details> | <details><summary>64 pa...</summary><p>64 pages. 14 pages for main paper, 50 pages for references + appendix</p></details> |
| **[Catastrophic Goodhart: regularizing RLHF with KL divergence does not mitigate heavy-tailed reward misspecification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14503v2)** | 2024-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When applying reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), the reward is learned from data and, therefore, always has some error. It is common to mitigate this by regularizing the policy with KL divergence from a base model, with the hope that balancing reward with regularization will achieve desirable outcomes despite this reward misspecification. We show that when the reward function has light-tailed error, optimal policies under less restrictive KL penalties achieve arbitrarily high utility. However, if error is heavy-tailed, some policies obtain arbitrarily high reward despite achieving no more utility than the base model--a phenomenon we call catastrophic Goodhart. We adapt a discrete optimization method to measure the tails of reward models, finding that they are consistent with light-tailed error. However, the pervasiveness of heavy-tailed distributions in many real-world applications indicates that future sources of RL reward could have heavy-tailed error, increasing the likelihood of reward hacking even with KL regularization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Mecha...</summary><p>Mechanistic Interpretability workshop at ICML 2024; Main conference poster at NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |
| **[SALSA: Soup-based Alignment Learning for Stronger Adaptation in RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01798v1)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In Large Language Model (LLM) development, Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is crucial for aligning models with human values and preferences. RLHF traditionally relies on the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the current policy and a frozen initial policy as a reference, which is added as a penalty in policy optimization algorithms like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). While this constraint prevents models from deviating too far from the initial checkpoint, it limits exploration of the reward landscape, reducing the model's ability to discover higher-quality solutions. As a result, policy optimization is often trapped in a narrow region of the parameter space, leading to suboptimal alignment and performance. This paper presents SALSA (Soup-based Alignment Learning for Stronger Adaptation), a novel approach designed to overcome these limitations by creating a more flexible and better located reference model through weight-space averaging of two independent supervised fine-tuned (SFT) models. This model soup allows for larger deviation in KL divergence and exploring a promising region of the solution space without sacrificing stability. By leveraging this more robust reference model, SALSA fosters better exploration, achieving higher rewards and improving model robustness, out-of-distribution generalization, and performance. We validate the effectiveness of SALSA through extensive experiments on popular open models (Llama2-7B, Mistral-7B, and Gemma-2B) across various benchmarks (MT-Bench, Arena-Hard, UltraFeedback), where it consistently surpasses PPO by fostering deeper exploration and achieving superior alignment in LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[InfoRM: Mitigating Reward Hacking in RLHF via Information-Theoretic Reward Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09345v5)** | 2024-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the success of reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) in aligning language models with human values, reward hacking, also termed reward overoptimization, remains a critical challenge. This issue primarily arises from reward misgeneralization, where reward models (RMs) compute reward using spurious features that are irrelevant to human preferences. In this work, we tackle this problem from an information-theoretic perspective and propose a framework for reward modeling, namely InfoRM, by introducing a variational information bottleneck objective to filter out irrelevant information. Notably, we further identify a correlation between overoptimization and outliers in the IB latent space of InfoRM, establishing it as a promising tool for detecting reward overoptimization. Inspired by this finding, we propose the Cluster Separation Index (CSI), which quantifies deviations in the IB latent space, as an indicator of reward overoptimization to facilitate the development of online mitigation strategies. Extensive experiments on a wide range of settings and RM scales (70M, 440M, 1.4B, and 7B) demonstrate the effectiveness of InfoRM. Further analyses reveal that InfoRM's overoptimization detection mechanism is not only effective but also robust across a broad range of datasets, signifying a notable advancement in the field of RLHF. The code will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper has been accepted by NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |
| **[Towards Reliable Alignment: Uncertainty-aware RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23726v1)** | 2024-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in aligning Large Language Models with human preferences have benefited from larger reward models and better preference data. However, most of these methodologies rely on the accuracy of the reward model. The reward models used in Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) are typically learned from small datasets using stochastic optimization algorithms, making them prone to high variability. We illustrate the inconsistencies between reward models empirically on numerous open-source datasets. We theoretically show that the fluctuation of the reward models can be detrimental to the alignment problem because the derived policies are more overfitted to the reward model and, hence, are riskier if the reward model itself is uncertain. We use concentration of measure to motivate an uncertainty-aware, conservative algorithm for policy optimization. We show that such policies are more risk-averse in the sense that they are more cautious of uncertain rewards. We theoretically prove that our proposed methodology has less risk than the vanilla method. We corroborate our theoretical results with experiments based on designing an ensemble of reward models. We use this ensemble of reward models to align a language model using our methodology and observe that our empirical findings match our theoretical predictions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reward Difference Optimization For Sample Reweighting In Offline RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09385v2)** | 2024-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), aligning LLMs with human preferences become increasingly important. Although Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) proves effective, it is complicated and highly resource-intensive. As such, offline RLHF has been introduced as an alternative solution, which directly optimizes LLMs with ranking losses on a fixed preference dataset. Current offline RLHF only captures the "ordinal relationship" between responses, overlooking the crucial aspect of how much one is preferred over the others. To address this issue, we propose a simple yet effective solution called Reward Difference Optimization, shorted as RDO. Specifically, we introduce reward difference coefficients to reweigh sample pairs in offline RLHF. We then develop a difference model which captures rich interactions between a pair of responses for predicting these difference coefficients. Experiments with 7B LLMs on the HH and TL;DR datasets substantiate the effectiveness of our method in both automatic metrics and human evaluation, thereby highlighting its potential for aligning LLMs with human intent and values</p></details> | EMNLP 2024 findings |
| **[Measuring memorization in RLHF for code completion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11715v2)** | 2024-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) has become the dominant method to align large models to user preferences. Unlike fine-tuning, for which there are many studies regarding training data memorization, it is not clear how memorization is affected by or introduced in the RLHF alignment process. Understanding this relationship is important as real user data may be collected and used to align large models; if user data is memorized during RLHF and later regurgitated, this could raise privacy concerns. In addition to RLHF, other methods such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and $\Psi$PO have gained popularity for learning directly from human preferences, removing the need for optimizing intermediary reward models with reinforcement learning. In this work, we analyze how training data memorization can surface and propagate through each phase of RLHF and direct preference learning. We focus our study on code completion models, as code completion is one of the most popular use cases for large language models. We find that RLHF significantly decreases the chance that data used for reward modeling and reinforcement learning is memorized in comparison to directly fine-tuning on this data, but that examples already memorized during the fine-tuning stage of RLHF, will, in the majority of cases, remain memorized after RLHF. In contrast, we find that aligning by learning directly from human preference data via a special case of $\Psi$PO, Identity Preference Optimization (IPO), increases the likelihood that training data is regurgitated compared to RLHF. Our work suggests that RLHF, as opposed to direct preference learning, is a safer way to mitigate the risk of regurgitating sensitive preference data when aligning large language models. We find our conclusions are robust across multiple code completion datasets, tasks, and model scales.</p></details> |  |

Among reasoning tasks, multi-step reasoning poses a particular challenge. Grounded in the theory of formal logic, we have developed an automated method, Multi-step Deduction (MuseD), for deductive reasoning data. MuseD has allowed us to create training and testing datasets for multi-step reasoning. Our generation method enables control over the complexity of the generated instructions, facilitating training and evaluation of models across different difficulty levels. Through RLHF training, our training data has demonstrated significant improvements in logical capabilities for both in-domain of out-of-domain reasoning tasks. Additionally, we have conducted tests to assess the multi-step reasoning abilities of various models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimal Design for Reward Modeling in RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17055v2)** | 2024-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has become a popular approach to align language models (LMs) with human preferences. This method involves collecting a large dataset of human pairwise preferences across various text generations and using it to infer (implicitly or explicitly) a reward model. Numerous methods have been proposed to learn the reward model and align a LM with it. However, the costly process of collecting human preferences has received little attention and could benefit from theoretical insights. This paper addresses this issue and aims to formalize the reward training model in RLHF. We frame the selection of an effective dataset as a simple regret minimization task, using a linear contextual dueling bandit method. Given the potentially large number of arms, this approach is more coherent than the best-arm identification setting. We then propose an offline framework for solving this problem. Under appropriate assumptions - linearity of the reward model in the embedding space, and boundedness of the reward parameter - we derive bounds on the simple regret. Finally, we provide a lower bound that matches our upper bound up to constant and logarithmic terms. To our knowledge, this is the first theoretical contribution in this area to provide an offline approach as well as worst-case guarantees.</p></details> |  |
| **[How to Evaluate Reward Models for RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14872v2)** | 2024-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a new benchmark for reward models that quantifies their ability to produce strong language models through RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback). The gold-standard approach is to run a full RLHF training pipeline and directly probe downstream LLM performance. However, this process is prohibitively expensive. To address this, we build a predictive model of downstream LLM performance by evaluating the reward model on proxy tasks. These proxy tasks consist of a large-scale human preference and a verifiable correctness preference dataset, in which we measure 12 metrics across 12 domains. To investigate which reward model metrics are most correlated to gold-standard RLHF outcomes, we launch an end-to-end RLHF experiment on a large-scale crowdsourced human preference platform to view real reward model downstream performance as ground truth. Ultimately, we compile our data and findings into Preference Proxy Evaluations (PPE), the first reward model benchmark explicitly linked to post-RLHF real-world human preference performance, which we open-source for public use and further development. Our code and evaluations can be found at https://github.com/lmarena/PPE .</p></details> |  |

| **[On The Global Convergence Of Online RLHF With Neural Parametrization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15610v1)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The importance of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values cannot be overstated. RLHF is a three-stage process that includes supervised fine-tuning (SFT), reward learning, and policy learning. Although there are several offline and online approaches to aligning LLMs, they often suffer from distribution shift issues. These issues arise from the inability to accurately capture the distributional interdependence between the reward learning and policy learning stages. Consequently, this has led to various approximated approaches, but the theoretical insights and motivations remain largely limited to tabular settings, which do not hold in practice. This gap between theoretical insights and practical implementations is critical. It is challenging to address this gap as it requires analyzing the performance of AI alignment algorithms in neural network-parameterized settings. Although bi-level formulations have shown promise in addressing distribution shift issues, they suffer from the hyper-gradient problem, and current approaches lack efficient algorithms to solve this. In this work, we tackle these challenges employing the bi-level formulation laid out in Kwon et al. (2024) along with the assumption \emph{Weak Gradient Domination} to demonstrate convergence in an RLHF setup, obtaining a sample complexity of $\epsilon^{-\frac{7}{2}}$ . Our key contributions are twofold: (i) We propose a bi-level formulation for AI alignment in parameterized settings and introduce a first-order approach to solve this problem. (ii) We analyze the theoretical convergence rates of the proposed algorithm and derive state-of-the-art bounds. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to establish convergence rate bounds and global optimality for the RLHF framework in neural network-parameterized settings.</p></details> |  |

Our results show that the RLHF-finetuned model has the best performance across different benchmarks for both objective and MOS-based speech quality assessment metrics on the Voicebank+DEMAND dataset.

| **[Reward-Robust RLHF in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15360v3)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to progress toward more advanced forms of intelligence, Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is increasingly seen as a key pathway toward achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). However, the reliance on reward-model-based (RM-based) alignment methods introduces significant challenges due to the inherent instability and imperfections of Reward Models (RMs), which can lead to critical issues such as reward hacking and misalignment with human intentions. In this paper, we introduce a reward-robust RLHF framework aimed at addressing these fundamental challenges, paving the way for more reliable and resilient learning in LLMs. Our approach introduces a novel optimization objective that carefully balances performance and robustness by incorporating Bayesian Reward Model Ensembles (BRME) to model the uncertainty set of reward functions. This allows the framework to integrate both nominal performance and minimum reward signals, ensuring more stable learning even with imperfect RMs. Empirical results demonstrate that our framework consistently outperforms baselines across diverse benchmarks, showing improved accuracy and long-term stability. We also provide a theoretical analysis, demonstrating that reward-robust RLHF approaches the stability of constant reward settings, which proves to be acceptable even in a stochastic-case analysis. Together, these contributions highlight the framework potential to enhance both the performance and stability of LLM alignment.</p></details> |  |

This challenges the widely held belief that stronger reward models always lead to better language models, and opens up new avenues for future research into the key factors driving model performance and how to choose the most suitable reward models.

| **[An Adaptive Placement and Parallelism Framework for Accelerating RLHF Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11819v3)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, ChatGPT or InstructGPT like large language models (LLM) has made a significant impact in the AI world. Many works have attempted to reproduce the complex InstructGPT's training pipeline, namely Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF). However, the mainstream distributed RLHF training methods typically adopt a fixed model placement strategy, referred to as the Co-located strategy. This strategy treats all four interdependent models involved in RLHF as a single entity, distributing them across all devices and applying parallelism techniques designed for a single model, regardless of the workload heterogeneity inherent to each model. As a result, this strategy exacerbates the generation bottlenecks in the RLHF training and degrades the overall training efficiency. To address these issues, we propose a flexible model placement framework that offers two general and agile model placement strategies. The Interleaving strategy helps reduce memory redundancy and communication costs of RLHF training by placing models without dependencies on exclusive devices with careful orchestration. On the other hand, the Disaggregated strategy improves the throughput of model training by separating the training and inference runtime of the RLHF pipeline with additional shadow models. Furthermore, our framework provides a simple user interface and guidelines to easily and flexibly configure these strategies in various training scenarios. Our experiments have shown that our strategy can achieve notable improvements up to 11x, compared to the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches. The results highlight the effectiveness and adaptability of our methods in accelerating the training of distributed RLHF.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mitigating the Alignment Tax of RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06256v4)** | 2024-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs acquire a wide range of abilities during pre-training, but aligning LLMs under Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) can lead to forgetting pretrained abilities, which is also known as the alignment tax. To investigate alignment tax, we conducted experiments with existing RLHF algorithms using OpenLLaMA-3B, which revealed a pronounced alignment tax in NLP tasks. Whereas, despite various techniques to mitigate forgetting, they are often at odds with the RLHF performance, leading to a trade-off between alignment performance and forgetting mitigation, leading to an alignment-forgetting trade-off. In this paper we show that model averaging, which simply interpolates between pre and post RLHF model weights, surprisingly achieves the most strongest alignment-forgetting Pareto front among a wide range of competing methods. To understand its effectiveness, we offer theoretical insights into model averaging, revealing that it enhances performance Pareto front by increasing feature diversity on the layers where tasks share overlapped feature spaces. Empirical evidence corroborates our analysis by showing the benefits of averaging low-level transformer layers. Building on the analysis and the observation that averaging different layers of the transformer leads to significantly different alignment-forgetting trade-offs, we propose Heterogeneous Model Averaging (HMA) to Heterogeneously find various combination ratios of model layers. HMA seeks to maximize the alignment performance while incurring minimal alignment tax. Moreover, we validate HMA's performance across a range of RLHF algorithms over OpenLLaMA-3B and further extend our findings to Mistral-7B which is evaluated by open-sourced preference model and GPT4.

| **[Regressing the Relative Future: Efficient Policy Optimization for Multi-turn RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04612v1)** | 2024-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success at tasks like summarization that involve a single turn of interaction. However, they can still struggle with multi-turn tasks like dialogue that require long-term planning. Previous works on multi-turn dialogue extend single-turn reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) methods to the multi-turn setting by treating all prior dialogue turns as a long context. Such approaches suffer from covariate shift: the conversations in the training set have previous turns generated by some reference policy, which means that low training error may not necessarily correspond to good performance when the learner is actually in the conversation loop. In response, we introduce REgressing the RELative FUture (REFUEL), an efficient policy optimization approach designed to address multi-turn RLHF in LLMs. REFUEL employs a single model to estimate $Q$-values and trains on self-generated data, addressing the covariate shift issue. REFUEL frames the multi-turn RLHF problem as a sequence of regression tasks on iteratively collected datasets, enabling ease of implementation. Theoretically, we prove that REFUEL can match the performance of any policy covered by the training set. Empirically, we evaluate our algorithm by using Llama-3.1-70B-it to simulate a user in conversation with our model. REFUEL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods such as DPO and REBEL across various settings. Furthermore, despite having only 8 billion parameters, Llama-3-8B-it fine-tuned with REFUEL outperforms Llama-3.1-70B-it on long multi-turn dialogues. Implementation of REFUEL can be found at https://github.com/ZhaolinGao/REFUEL/, and models trained by REFUEL can be found at https://huggingface.co/Cornell-AGI.</p></details> |  |
| **[WPO: Enhancing RLHF with Weighted Preference Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11827v2)** | 2024-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is a promising solution to align large language models (LLMs) more closely with human values. Off-policy preference optimization, where the preference data is obtained from other models, is widely adopted due to its cost efficiency and scalability. However, off-policy preference optimization often suffers from a distributional gap between the policy used for data collection and the target policy, leading to suboptimal optimization. In this paper, we propose a novel strategy to mitigate this problem by simulating on-policy learning with off-policy preference data. Our Weighted Preference Optimization (WPO) method adapts off-policy data to resemble on-policy data more closely by reweighting preference pairs according to their probability under the current policy. This method not only addresses the distributional gap problem but also enhances the optimization process without incurring additional costs. We validate our method on instruction following benchmarks including Alpaca Eval 2 and MT-bench. WPO not only outperforms Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) by up to 5.6% on Alpaca Eval 2 but also establishes a remarkable length-controlled winning rate against GPT-4-turbo of 76.7% based on Gemma-2-9b-it. We release the code and models at https://github.com/wzhouad/WPO.</p></details> | EMNLP 2024 |
| **[HybridFlow: A Flexible and Efficient RLHF Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19256v2)** | 2024-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is widely used in Large Language Model (LLM) alignment. Traditional RL can be modeled as a dataflow, where each node represents computation of a neural network (NN) and each edge denotes data dependencies between the NNs. RLHF complicates the dataflow by expanding each node into a distributed LLM training or generation program, and each edge into a many-to-many multicast. Traditional RL frameworks execute the dataflow using a single controller to instruct both intra-node computation and inter-node communication, which can be inefficient in RLHF due to large control dispatch overhead for distributed intra-node computation. Existing RLHF systems adopt a multi-controller paradigm, which can be inflexible due to nesting distributed computation and data communication. We propose HybridFlow, which combines single-controller and multi-controller paradigms in a hybrid manner to enable flexible representation and efficient execution of the RLHF dataflow. We carefully design a set of hierarchical APIs that decouple and encapsulate computation and data dependencies in the complex RLHF dataflow, allowing efficient operation orchestration to implement RLHF algorithms and flexible mapping of the computation onto various devices. We further design a 3D-HybridEngine for efficient actor model resharding between training and generation phases, with zero memory redundancy and significantly reduced communication overhead. Our experimental results demonstrate 1.53$\times$~20.57$\times$ throughput improvement when running various RLHF algorithms using HybridFlow, as compared with state-of-the-art baselines. HybridFlow source code will be available at https://github.com/volcengine/verl.</p></details> |  |
| **[UNA: Unifying Alignments of RLHF/PPO, DPO and KTO by a Generalized Implicit Reward Function](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15339v2)** | 2024-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An LLM is pretrained on trillions of tokens, but the pretrained LLM may still generate undesired responses. To solve this problem, alignment techniques such as RLHF, DPO and KTO are proposed. However, these alignment techniques have limitations. For example, RLHF requires training the reward model and policy separately, which is complex, time-consuming, memory intensive and unstable during training processes. DPO proposes a mapping between an optimal policy and a reward, greatly simplifying the training process of RLHF. However, it can not take full advantages of a reward model and it is limited to pairwise preference data. In this paper, we propose \textbf{UN}ified \textbf{A}lignment (UNA) which unifies RLHF/PPO, DPO and KTO. Firstly, we mathematically prove that given the classical RLHF objective, the optimal policy is induced by a generalize implicit reward function. With this novel mapping between a reward model and an optimal policy, UNA can 1. unify RLHF/PPO, DPO and KTO into a supervised learning of minimizing the difference between an implicit reward and an explicit reward; 2. outperform RLHF/PPO while simplify, stabilize, speed up and reduce memory burden of RL fine-tuning process; 3. accommodate different feedback types including pairwise, binary and scalar feedback. Downstream experiments show UNA outperforms DPO, KTO and RLHF.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Perfect Blend: Redefining RLHF with Mixture of Judges](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20370v1)** | 2024-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has become the leading approach for fine-tuning large language models (LLM). However, RLHF has limitations in multi-task learning (MTL) due to challenges of reward hacking and extreme multi-objective optimization (i.e., trade-off of multiple and/or sometimes conflicting objectives). Applying RLHF for MTL currently requires careful tuning of the weights for reward model and data combinations. This is often done via human intuition and does not generalize. In this work, we introduce a novel post-training paradigm which we called Constrained Generative Policy Optimization (CGPO). The core of CGPO is Mixture of Judges (MoJ) with cost-efficient constrained policy optimization with stratification, which can identify the perfect blend in RLHF in a principled manner. It shows strong empirical results with theoretical guarantees, does not require extensive hyper-parameter tuning, and is plug-and-play in common post-training pipelines. Together, this can detect and mitigate reward hacking behaviors while reaching a pareto-optimal point across an extremely large number of objectives. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that CGPO significantly outperforms standard RLHF algorithms like PPO and DPO across various tasks including general chat, STEM questions, instruction following, and coding. Specifically, CGPO shows improvements of 7.4% in AlpacaEval-2 (general chat), 12.5% in Arena-Hard (STEM & reasoning), and consistent gains in other domains like math and coding. Notably, PPO, while commonly used, is prone to severe reward hacking in popular coding benchmarks, which CGPO successfully addresses. This breakthrough in RLHF not only tackles reward hacking and extreme multi-objective optimization challenges but also advances the state-of-the-art in aligning general-purpose LLMs for diverse applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to conference</p></details> |
| **[RLHFuse: Efficient RLHF Training for Large Language Models with Inter- and Intra-Stage Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13221v2)** | 2024-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) enhances the alignment between LLMs and human preference. The workflow of RLHF typically involves several models and tasks in a series of distinct stages. Existing RLHF training systems view each task as the smallest execution unit thus overlooking the opportunities for subtask-level optimizations. Due to the intrinsic nature of RLHF training, i.e., the data skewness in the generation stage, and the pipeline bubbles in the training stage, existing RLHF systems suffer from low GPU utilization in production deployments. RLHFuse breaks the traditional view of RLHF workflow as a composition of individual tasks, splitting each task into finer-grained subtasks, and performing stage fusion to improve GPU utilization. RLHFuse contains two key ideas. First, for generation and inference tasks, RLHFuse splits them into sample-level subtasks, enabling efficient inter-stage fusion to mitigate the original generation bottleneck dominated by long-tailed samples. Second, for training tasks, RLHFuse breaks them into subtasks of micro-batches. By leveraging the intuition that pipeline execution can be essentially complemented by another pipeline, RLHFuse performs intra-stage fusion to concurrently execute these subtasks in the training stage with a fused pipeline schedule, resulting in fewer pipeline bubbles. In addition, RLHFuse incorporates a series of system optimizations tailored for each stage of RLHF, making it efficient and scalable for our internal product usage. We evaluate RLHFuse on various popular LLMs and the results show that RLHFuse increases the training throughput by up to 3.7x, compared to existing state-of-the-art systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantile Regression for Distributional Reward Models in RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10164v1)** | 2024-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has become a key method for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences through the use of reward models. However, traditional reward models typically generate point estimates, which oversimplify the diversity and complexity of human values and preferences. In this paper, we introduce Quantile Reward Models (QRMs), a novel approach to reward modeling that learns a distribution over rewards instead of a single scalar value. Our method uses quantile regression to estimate a full, potentially multimodal distribution over preferences, providing a more powerful and nuanced representation of preferences. This distributional approach can better capture the diversity of human values, addresses label noise, and accommodates conflicting preferences by modeling them as distinct modes in the distribution. Our experimental results show that QRM outperforms comparable traditional point-estimate models on RewardBench. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the additional information provided by the distributional estimates can be utilized in downstream applications, such as risk-aware reinforcement learning, resulting in LLM policies that generate fewer extremely negative responses. Our code and model are released at https://github.com/Nicolinho/QRM.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Data-Centric RLHF: Simple Metrics for Preference Dataset Comparison](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09603v1)** | 2024-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The goal of aligning language models to human preferences requires data that reveal these preferences. Ideally, time and money can be spent carefully collecting and tailoring bespoke preference data to each downstream application. However, in practice, a select few publicly available preference datasets are often used to train reward models for reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). While new preference datasets are being introduced with increasing frequency, there are currently no existing efforts to measure and compare these datasets. In this paper, we systematically study preference datasets through three perspectives: scale, label noise, and information content. We propose specific metrics for each of these perspectives and uncover different axes of comparison for a better understanding of preference datasets. Our work is a first step towards a data-centric approach to alignment by providing perspectives that aid in training efficiency and iterative data collection for RLHF.</p></details> | Working Paper |
| **[Reward Generalization in RLHF: A Topological Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10184v6)** | 2024-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing alignment methods share a common topology of information flow, where reward information is collected from humans, modeled with preference learning, and used to tune language models. However, this shared topology has not been systematically characterized, nor have its alternatives been thoroughly explored, leaving the problems of low data efficiency and unreliable generalization unaddressed. As a solution, we introduce a theoretical framework for investigating reward generalization in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), focusing on the topology of information flow at both macro and micro levels. At the macro level, we portray the RLHF information flow as an autoencoding process over behavior distributions, formalizing the RLHF objective of distributional consistency between human preference and model behavior. At the micro level, we present induced Bayesian networks as a theory of reward generalization in RLHF, introducing fine-grained dataset topologies into generalization bounds. Combining analysis on both levels, we propose reward modeling from tree-structured preference information. It is shown to reduce reward uncertainty by up to $\Theta(\log n/\log\log n)$ times compared to baselines, where $n$ is the dataset size. Validation on three NLP tasks shows that our tree-based reward model achieves an average win rate of 65% against baseline methods, thus improving reward generalization for free via topology design.</p></details> |  |

RL from AI Feedback (RLAIF), introduced in Bai et al., offers a promising alternative that trains the reward model (RM) on preferences generated by an off-the-shelf LLM. Across the tasks of summarization, helpful dialogue generation, and harmless dialogue generation, we show that RLAIF achieves comparable performance to RLHF. Furthermore, we take a step towards "self-improvement" by demonstrating that RLAIF can outperform a supervised fine-tuned baseline even when the AI labeler is the same size as the policy, or even the exact same checkpoint as the initial policy. Finally, we introduce direct-RLAIF (d-RLAIF) - a technique that circumvents RM training by obtaining rewards directly from an off-the-shelf LLM during RL, which achieves superior performance to canonical RLAIF. Our results suggest that RLAIF can achieve performance on-par with using human feedback, offering a potential solution to the scalability limitations of RLHF.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at ICML 2024</p></details> |
| **[Sequence to Sequence Reward Modeling: Improving RLHF by Language Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00162v1)** | 2024-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aligning the behavior of Large language models (LLMs) with human intentions and values remains a critical challenge. Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) aligns LLMs by training a reward model (RM) on human preferences and fine-tuning the LLMs to maximize RM feedback. Despite its effectiveness and popularity, RLHF is prone to biased local optimization. It means RM fails to provide feedback that accurately aligns with human preference, causing LLMs to explore unexpected generalizations, and failing to achieve alignment objectives. To mitigate this issue, we propose a novel \textit{sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) reward modeling} method. Its key insight is that learning from language feedback rather than scalar feedback improves RLHF without additional annotations. We replaced the reward modeling target from binary maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) with sequence MLE. This method enables richer and fine-grained language feedback without additional annotations, models, or training stages. Our experiments demonstrated its effectiveness, specifically, reducing the refusal-to-response paradigm in single-turn safety dialogues and the long-response bias in text summarization tasks. We provide further analysis that seq2seq RM improves RLHF performance across 2B and 7B LLMs on 3 NLP tasks, achieving an average win rate of 76.9\%. We further show that seq2seq RM can still improve the performance of RLHF under out-of-distribution prompts.</p></details> | 7 pages |

RLHF requires a large number of preference pairs as training data, which are often used in both the Supervised Fine-Tuning and Reward Model training and therefore publicly available datasets are commonly used. In this work, we study to what extent a malicious actor can manipulate the LMs generations by poisoning the preferences, i.e., injecting poisonous preference pairs into these datasets and the RLHF training process. We propose strategies to build poisonous preference pairs and test their performance by poisoning two widely used preference datasets. Our results show that preference poisoning is highly effective: injecting a small amount of poisonous data (1-5\% of the original dataset), we can effectively manipulate the LM to generate a target entity in a target sentiment (positive or negative). The findings from our experiments also shed light on strategies to defend against the preference poisoning attack.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploration-Driven Policy Optimization in RLHF: Theoretical Insights on Efficient Data Utilization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10342v2)** | 2024-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has achieved impressive empirical successes while relying on a small amount of human feedback. However, there is limited theoretical justification for this phenomenon. Additionally, most recent studies focus on value-based algorithms despite the recent empirical successes of policy-based algorithms. In this work, we consider an RLHF algorithm based on policy optimization (PO-RLHF). The algorithm is based on the popular Policy Cover-Policy Gradient (PC-PG) algorithm, which assumes knowledge of the reward function. In PO-RLHF, knowledge of the reward function is not assumed, and the algorithm uses trajectory-based comparison feedback to infer the reward function. We provide performance bounds for PO-RLHF with low query complexity, which provides insight into why a small amount of human feedback may be sufficient to achieve good performance with RLHF. A key novelty is a trajectory-level elliptical potential analysis, which bounds the reward estimation error when comparison feedback (rather than numerical reward observation) is given. We provide and analyze algorithms PG-RLHF and NN-PG-RLHF for two settings: linear and neural function approximation, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Long Way to Go: Investigating Length Correlations in RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03716v2)** | 2024-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Great success has been reported using Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) to align large language models, with open preference datasets enabling wider experimentation, particularly for "helpfulness" in tasks like dialogue and web question answering. Alongside these improvements, however, RLHF also often drives models to produce longer outputs. This paper demonstrates, on three diverse settings, that optimizing for response length is, much more than previously thought, a significant factor behind RLHF. Studying the strategies RL optimization uses to maximize reward, we find improvements in reward to largely be driven by increasing response length, instead of other features. Indeed, we find that even a purely length-based reward reproduces most downstream RLHF improvements over supervised fine-tuned models. Testing a comprehensive set of length-countering interventions, we identify the dominant source of these biases to be reward models, which, by studying training dynamics, we find are non-robust and easily influenced by length biases in preference data.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 13 figures, Accepted to COLM 2024</p></details> |

Notably, collecting human feedback for RLHF can be resource-intensive and lead to scalability issues for LLMs and complex tasks. Our proposed framework Proto-RM leverages prototypical networks to enhance reward models under limited human feedback. By enabling stable and reliable structural learning from fewer samples, Proto-RM significantly enhances LLMs' adaptability and accuracy in interpreting human preferences. Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate that Proto-RM significantly improves the performance of reward models and LLMs in human feedback tasks, achieving comparable and usually better results than traditional methods, while requiring significantly less data. in data-limited scenarios. This research offers a promising direction for enhancing the efficiency of reward models and optimizing the fine-tuning of language models under restricted feedback conditions.</p></details> | Accepted by ACL 2024 |

Since RLHF involves diverse computational workloads and intricate dependencies among multiple LLMs, directly adopting parallelization techniques from supervised training can result in sub-optimal performance. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel approach named parameter ReaLlocation, which dynamically redistributes LLM parameters in the cluster and adapts parallelization strategies during training. Building upon this idea, we introduce ReaLHF, a pioneering system capable of automatically discovering and running efficient execution plans for RLHF training given the desired algorithmic and hardware configurations. ReaLHF formulates the execution plan for RLHF as an augmented dataflow graph. Based on this formulation, ReaLHF employs a tailored search algorithm with a lightweight cost estimator to discover an efficient execution plan. Subsequently, the runtime engine deploys the selected plan by effectively parallelizing computations and redistributing parameters. We evaluate ReaLHF on the LLaMA-2 models with up to $4\times70$ billion parameters and 128 GPUs. The experiment results showcase ReaLHF's substantial speedups of $2.0-10.6\times$ compared to baselines. Furthermore, the execution plans generated by ReaLHF exhibit an average of $26\%$ performance improvement over heuristic approaches based on Megatron-LM. The source code of ReaLHF is publicly available at https://github.com/openpsi-project/ReaLHF .</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages (15 pages with references), 13 figures</p></details> |

Instead of focusing solely on PMs and RMs independently, we propose to examine their interactions during fine-tuning, introducing the concept of seamlessness. Our study starts with observing the saturation phenomenon, where continual improvements in RM and PM do not translate into RLHF progress. Our analysis shows that RMs fail to assign proper scores to PM responses, resulting in a 35% mismatch rate with human preferences, highlighting a significant discrepancy between PM and RM. To measure seamlessness between PM and RM without human effort, we propose an automatic metric, SEAM. SEAM quantifies the discrepancies between PM and RM judgments induced by data samples. We validate the effectiveness of SEAM in data selection and model augmentation. Our experiments demonstrate that (1) using SEAM-filtered data for RL training improves RLHF performance by 4.5%, and (2) SEAM-guided model augmentation results in a 4% performance improvement over standard augmentation methods.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents a novel two-step Coarse-to-Fine Actor model to address the inherent limitations in conversational and analytical capabilities of small-sized LLMs. Our approach begins with the Policy-based Coarse Actor, employing a technique we term "Continuous Maximization". The Coarse Actor establishes an enhanced, knowledge-rich pool adept at aligning with human preference styles in analysis and reasoning. Through the RLHF process, it employs Continuous Maximization, a strategy that dynamically and adaptively extends the output length limit, enabling the generation of more detailed and analytical content. Subsequently, the Fine Actor refines this analytical content, addressing the generation of excessively redundant information from the Coarse Actor. We introduce a "Knowledge Residue Merger" approach, refining the content from the Coarse Actor and merging it with an existing Instruction model to improve quality, correctness, and reduce redundancies. We applied our methodology to the popular Mistral model, creating Mistral-C2F, which has demonstrated exceptional performance across 11 general language tasks and the MT-Bench Dialogue task, outperforming similar-scale models and even larger models with 13B and 30B parameters. Our model has significantly improved conversational and analytical reasoning abilities.</p></details> |  |

Current autonomous driving methods typically utilize either human feedback in machine learning, including RL, or LLMs. Most feedback guides the car agent's learning process (e.g., controlling the car). RLHF is usually applied in the fine-tuning step, requiring direct human "preferences," which are not commonly used in optimizing autonomous driving models. In this research, we innovatively combine RLHF and LLMs to enhance autonomous driving safety. Training a model with human guidance from scratch is inefficient. Our framework starts with a pre-trained autonomous car agent model and implements multiple human-controlled agents, such as cars and pedestrians, to simulate real-life road environments. The autonomous car model is not directly controlled by humans. We integrate both physical and physiological feedback to fine-tune the model, optimizing this process using LLMs. This multi-agent interactive environment ensures safe, realistic interactions before real-world application. Finally, we will validate our model using data gathered from real-life testbeds located in New Jersey and New York City.</p></details> |  |
| **[Active Preference Optimization for Sample Efficient RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10500v2)** | 2024-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is pivotal in aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences. Although aligned generative models have shown remarkable abilities in various tasks, their reliance on high-quality human preference data creates a costly bottleneck in the practical application of RLHF. One primary reason is that current methods rely on uniformly picking prompt-generation pairs from a dataset of prompt-generations, to collect human feedback, resulting in sub-optimal alignment under a constrained budget, which highlights the criticality of adaptive strategies in efficient alignment. Recent works [Mehta et al., 2023, Muldrew et al., 2024] have tried to address this problem by designing various heuristics based on generation uncertainty. However, either the assumptions in [Mehta et al., 2023] are restrictive, or [Muldrew et al., 2024] do not provide any rigorous theoretical guarantee. To address these, we reformulate RLHF within contextual preference bandit framework, treating prompts as contexts, and develop an active-learning algorithm, $\textit{Active Preference Optimization}$ ($\texttt{APO}$), which enhances model alignment by querying preference data from the most important samples, achieving superior performance for small sample budget. We analyze the theoretical performance guarantees of $\texttt{APO}$ under the BTL preference model showing that the suboptimality gap of the policy learned via $\texttt{APO}$ scales as $O(1/\sqrt{T})$ for a budget of $T$. We also show that collecting preference data by choosing prompts randomly leads to a policy that suffers a constant sub-optimality. We perform detailed experimental evaluations on practical preference datasets to validate $\texttt{APO}$'s efficacy over the existing methods, establishing it as a sample-efficient and practical solution of alignment in a cost-effective and scalable manner.</p></details> | <details><summary>New e...</summary><p>New experimental results added.

However, their applications have been restricted to the supervised learning setting, where static objective functions with benign structures are considered. But bilevel problems such as incentive design, inverse reinforcement learning (RL), and RL from human feedback (RLHF) are often modeled as dynamic objective functions that go beyond the simple static objective structures, which pose significant challenges of using existing bilevel solutions. To tackle this new class of bilevel problems, we introduce the first principled algorithmic framework for solving bilevel RL problems through the lens of penalty formulation. We provide theoretical studies of the problem landscape and its penalty-based (policy) gradient algorithms. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms via simulations in the Stackelberg Markov game, RL from human feedback and incentive design.</p></details> | <details><summary>Short...</summary><p>Shorter version accepted to ICML 2024</p></details> |

We consider online exploration in RLHF, which exploits interactive access to human or AI feedback by deliberately encouraging the model to produce diverse, maximally informative responses. By allowing RLHF to confidently stray from the pre-trained model, online exploration offers the possibility of novel, potentially super-human capabilities, but its full potential as a paradigm for language model training has yet to be realized, owing to computational and statistical bottlenecks in directly adapting existing reinforcement learning techniques. We propose a new algorithm for online exploration in RLHF, Exploratory Preference Optimization (XPO), which is simple and practical -- a one-line change to (online) Direct Preference Optimization (DPO; Rafailov et al., 2023) -- yet enjoys the strongest known provable guarantees and promising empirical performance. XPO augments the DPO objective with a novel and principled exploration bonus, empowering the algorithm to explore outside the support of the initial model and human feedback data. In theory, we show that XPO is provably sample-efficient and converges to a near-optimal language model policy under natural exploration conditions, irrespective of whether the initial model has good coverage. Our analysis, which builds on the observation that DPO implicitly performs a form of $Q^{\star}$-approximation (or, Bellman error minimization), combines previously disparate techniques from language modeling and theoretical reinforcement learning in a serendipitous fashion through the perspective of KL-regularized Markov decision processes. Empirically, we find that XPO is more sample-efficient than non-exploratory DPO variants in a preliminary evaluation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Group Robust Preference Optimization in Reward-free RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20304v1)** | 2024-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adapting large language models (LLMs) for specific tasks usually involves fine-tuning through reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) on preference data. While these data often come from diverse labelers' groups (e.g., different demographics, ethnicities, company teams, etc.), traditional RLHF approaches adopt a "one-size-fits-all" approach, i.e., they indiscriminately assume and optimize a single preference model, thus not being robust to unique characteristics and needs of the various groups. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Group Robust Preference Optimization (GRPO) method to align LLMs to individual groups' preferences robustly. Our approach builds upon reward-free direct preference optimization methods, but unlike previous approaches, it seeks a robust policy which maximizes the worst-case group performance. To achieve this, GRPO adaptively and sequentially weights the importance of different groups, prioritizing groups with worse cumulative loss. We theoretically study the feasibility of GRPO and analyze its convergence for the log-linear policy class. By fine-tuning LLMs with GRPO using diverse group-based global opinion data, we significantly improved performance for the worst-performing groups, reduced loss imbalances across groups, and improved probability accuracies compared to non-robust baselines.</p></details> | Preprint |

Most existing RLHF paradigms make the underlying assumption that human preferences are relatively homogeneous, and can be encoded by a single reward model. In this paper, we focus on addressing the issues due to the inherent heterogeneity in human preferences, as well as their potential strategic behavior in providing feedback. Specifically, we propose two frameworks to address heterogeneous human feedback in principled ways: personalization-based one and aggregation-based one. For the former, we propose two approaches based on representation learning and clustering, respectively, for learning multiple reward models that trades off the bias (due to preference heterogeneity) and variance (due to the use of fewer data for learning each model by personalization). We then establish sample complexity guarantees for both approaches. For the latter, we aim to adhere to the single-model framework, as already deployed in the current RLHF paradigm, by carefully aggregating diverse and truthful preferences from humans. We propose two approaches based on reward and preference aggregation, respectively: the former utilizes both utilitarianism and Leximin approaches to aggregate individual reward models, with sample complexity guarantees; the latter directly aggregates the human feedback in the form of probabilistic opinions. Under the probabilistic-opinion-feedback model, we also develop an approach to handle strategic human labelers who may bias and manipulate the aggregated preferences with untruthful feedback. Based on the ideas in mechanism design, our approach ensures truthful preference reporting, with the induced aggregation rule maximizing social welfare functions.</p></details> | Added experiments |
| **[On the Algorithmic Bias of Aligning Large Language Models with RLHF: Preference Collapse and Matching Regularization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16455v1)** | 2024-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences is crucial for informing fair, economically sound, and statistically efficient decision-making processes. However, we argue that reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) -- the predominant approach for aligning LLMs with human preferences through a reward model -- suffers from an inherent algorithmic bias due to its Kullback--Leibler-based regularization in optimization. In extreme cases, this bias could lead to a phenomenon we term preference collapse, where minority preferences are virtually disregarded. To mitigate this algorithmic bias, we introduce preference matching (PM) RLHF, a novel approach that provably aligns LLMs with the preference distribution of the reward model under the Bradley--Terry--Luce/Plackett--Luce model. Central to our approach is a PM regularizer that takes the form of the negative logarithm of the LLM's policy probability distribution over responses, which helps the LLM balance response diversification and reward maximization. Notably, we obtain this regularizer by solving an ordinary differential equation that is necessary for the PM property. For practical implementation, we introduce a conditional variant of PM RLHF that is tailored to natural language generation. Finally, we empirically validate the effectiveness of conditional PM RLHF through experiments on the OPT-1.3B and Llama-2-7B models, demonstrating a 29% to 41% improvement in alignment with human preferences, as measured by a certain metric, compared to standard RLHF.</p></details> |  |
| **[Iterative Preference Learning from Human Feedback: Bridging Theory and Practice for RLHF under KL-Constraint](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11456v4)** | 2024-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper studies the alignment process of generative models with Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). We first identify the primary challenges of existing popular methods like offline PPO and offline DPO as lacking in strategical exploration of the environment. Then, to understand the mathematical principle of RLHF, we consider a standard mathematical formulation, the reverse-KL regularized contextual bandit for RLHF. Despite its widespread practical application, a rigorous theoretical analysis of this formulation remains open. We investigate its behavior in three distinct settings -- offline, online, and hybrid -- and propose efficient algorithms with finite-sample theoretical guarantees. Moving towards practical applications, our framework, with a robust approximation of the information-theoretical policy improvement oracle, naturally gives rise to several novel RLHF algorithms. This includes an iterative version of the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) algorithm for online settings, and a multi-step rejection sampling strategy for offline scenarios. Our empirical evaluations on real-world alignment experiment of large language model demonstrate that these proposed methods significantly surpass existing strong baselines, such as DPO and Rejection Sampling Optimization (RSO), showcasing the connections between solid theoretical foundations and their potent practical implementations.</p></details> | <details><summary>53 pa...</summary><p>53 pages; theoretical study and algorithmic design of iterative RLHF and DPO</p></details> |

Social choice theory's analysis of settings such as voting mechanisms provides technical infrastructure that can inform how to aggregate human preferences amid disagreement. We analyze the problem settings of social choice and RLHF, identify key differences between them, and discuss how these differences may affect the RLHF interpretation of well-known technical results in social choice.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging Domain Knowledge for Efficient Reward Modelling in RLHF: A Case-Study in E-Commerce Opinion Summarization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15473v2)** | 2024-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has become a dominating strategy in aligning Language Models (LMs) with human values/goals. The key to the strategy is learning a reward model ($\varphi$), which can reflect the latent reward model of humans. While this strategy has proven effective, the training methodology requires a lot of human preference annotation (usually in the order of tens of thousands) to train $\varphi$. Such a large-scale annotation is justifiable when it's a one-time effort, and the reward model is universally applicable. However, human goals are subjective and depend on the task, requiring task-specific preference annotations, which can be impractical to fulfill. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach to infuse domain knowledge into $\varphi$, which reduces the amount of preference annotation required ($21\times$), omits Alignment Tax, and provides some interpretability. We validate our approach in E-Commerce Opinion Summarization, with a significant reduction in dataset size (to just $940$ samples) while advancing the SOTA ($\sim4$ point ROUGE-L improvement, $68\%$ of times preferred by humans over SOTA). Our contributions include a novel Reward Modeling technique and two new datasets: PromptOpinSumm (supervised data for Opinion Summarization) and OpinPref (a gold-standard human preference dataset). The proposed methodology opens up avenues for efficient RLHF, making it more adaptable to applications with varying human values. We release the artifacts (Code: github.com/efficient-rlhf. PromptOpinSumm: hf.co/prompt-opin-summ. OpinPref: hf.co/opin-pref) for usage under MIT License.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 6 figures, 21 tables</p></details> |
| **[Distributional Preference Learning: Understanding and Accounting for Hidden Context in RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08358v2)** | 2024-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In practice, preference learning from human feedback depends on incomplete data with hidden context. Hidden context refers to data that affects the feedback received, but which is not represented in the data used to train a preference model. This captures common issues of data collection, such as having human annotators with varied preferences, cognitive processes that result in seemingly irrational behavior, and combining data labeled according to different criteria. We prove that standard applications of preference learning, including reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), implicitly aggregate over hidden contexts according to a well-known voting rule called Borda count. We show this can produce counter-intuitive results that are very different from other methods which implicitly aggregate via expected utility. Furthermore, our analysis formalizes the way that preference learning from users with diverse values tacitly implements a social choice function. A key implication of this result is that annotators have an incentive to misreport their preferences in order to influence the learned model, leading to vulnerabilities in the deployment of RLHF. As a step towards mitigating these problems, we introduce a class of methods called distributional preference learning (DPL). DPL methods estimate a distribution of possible score values for each alternative in order to better account for hidden context. Experimental results indicate that applying DPL to RLHF for LLM chatbots identifies hidden context in the data and significantly reduces subsequent jailbreak vulnerability.

| **[Dataset Reset Policy Optimization for RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08495v3)** | 2024-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) from Human Preference-based feedback is a popular paradigm for fine-tuning generative models, which has produced impressive models such as GPT-4 and Claude3 Opus. This framework often consists of two steps: learning a reward model from an offline preference dataset followed by running online RL to optimize the learned reward model. In this work, leveraging the idea of reset, we propose a new RLHF algorithm with provable guarantees. Motivated by the fact that offline preference dataset provides informative states (i.e., data that is preferred by the labelers), our new algorithm, Dataset Reset Policy Optimization (DR-PO), integrates the existing offline preference dataset into the online policy training procedure via dataset reset: it directly resets the policy optimizer to the states in the offline dataset, instead of always starting from the initial state distribution. In theory, we show that DR-PO learns to perform at least as good as any policy that is covered by the offline dataset under general function approximation with finite sample complexity. In experiments, we demonstrate that on both the TL;DR summarization and the Anthropic Helpful Harmful (HH) dataset, the generation from DR-PO is better than that from Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Direction Preference Optimization (DPO), under the metric of GPT4 win-rate. Code for this work can be found at https://github.com/Cornell-RL/drpo.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 6 tables, 3 Figures, 3 Algorithms</p></details> |
| **[RLHF Deciphered: A Critical Analysis of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback for LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08555v2)** | 2024-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) have become indispensable tools for various tasks. However, training LLMs to serve as effective assistants for humans requires careful consideration. A promising approach is reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), which leverages human feedback to update the model in accordance with human preferences and mitigate issues like toxicity and hallucinations. Yet, an understanding of RLHF for LLMs is largely entangled with initial design choices that popularized the method and current research focuses on augmenting those choices rather than fundamentally improving the framework. In this paper, we analyze RLHF through the lens of reinforcement learning principles to develop an understanding of its fundamentals, dedicating substantial focus to the core component of RLHF -- the reward model. Our study investigates modeling choices, caveats of function approximation, and their implications on RLHF training algorithms, highlighting the underlying assumptions made about the expressivity of reward. Our analysis improves the understanding of the role of reward models and methods for their training, concurrently revealing limitations of the current methodology. We characterize these limitations, including incorrect generalization, model misspecification, and the sparsity of feedback, along with their impact on the performance of a language model. The discussion and analysis are substantiated by a categorical review of current literature, serving as a reference for researchers and practitioners to understand the challenges of RLHF and build upon existing efforts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Removing RLHF Protections in GPT-4 via Fine-Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05553v3)** | 2024-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) have increased in their capabilities, so does their potential for dual use. To reduce harmful outputs, produces and vendors of LLMs have used reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF). In tandem, LLM vendors have been increasingly enabling fine-tuning of their most powerful models. However, concurrent work has shown that fine-tuning can remove RLHF protections. We may expect that the most powerful models currently available (GPT-4) are less susceptible to fine-tuning attacks. In this work, we show the contrary: fine-tuning allows attackers to remove RLHF protections with as few as 340 examples and a 95% success rate. These training examples can be automatically generated with weaker models. We further show that removing RLHF protections does not decrease usefulness on non-censored outputs, providing evidence that our fine-tuning strategy does not decrease usefulness despite using weaker models to generate training data. Our results show the need for further research on protections on LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NAACL 2024. (7 pages)</p></details> |

| **[Balancing Enhancement, Harmlessness, and General Capabilities: Enhancing Conversational LLMs with Direct RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02513v1)** | 2024-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent advancements in Conversational Large Language Models (LLMs), a concerning trend has emerged, showing that many new base LLMs experience a knowledge reduction in their foundational capabilities following Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). This process often leads to issues such as forgetting or a decrease in the base model's abilities. Moreover, fine-tuned models struggle to align with user preferences, inadvertently increasing the generation of toxic outputs when specifically prompted. To overcome these challenges, we adopted an innovative approach by completely bypassing SFT and directly implementing Harmless Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). Our method not only preserves the base model's general capabilities but also significantly enhances its conversational abilities, while notably reducing the generation of toxic outputs. Our approach holds significant implications for fields that demand a nuanced understanding and generation of responses, such as customer service. We applied this methodology to Mistral, the most popular base model, thereby creating Mistral-Plus. Our validation across 11 general tasks demonstrates that Mistral-Plus outperforms similarly sized open-source base models and their corresponding instruct versions. Importantly, the conversational abilities of Mistral-Plus were significantly improved, indicating a substantial advancement over traditional SFT models in both safety and user preference alignment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Understanding the Effects of RLHF on LLM Generalisation and Diversity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06452v3)** | 2024-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) fine-tuned with reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) have been used in some of the most widely deployed AI models to date, such as OpenAI's ChatGPT or Anthropic's Claude. While there has been significant work developing these methods, our understanding of the benefits and downsides of each stage in RLHF is still limited. To fill this gap, we present an extensive analysis of how each stage of the process (i.e. supervised fine-tuning (SFT), reward modelling, and RLHF) affects two key properties: out-of-distribution (OOD) generalisation and output diversity. OOD generalisation is crucial given the wide range of real-world scenarios in which these models are being used, while output diversity refers to the model's ability to generate varied outputs and is important for a variety of use cases. We perform our analysis across two base models on both summarisation and instruction following tasks, the latter being highly relevant for current LLM use cases. We find that RLHF generalises better than SFT to new inputs, particularly as the distribution shift between train and test becomes larger. However, RLHF significantly reduces output diversity compared to SFT across a variety of measures, implying a tradeoff in current LLM fine-tuning methods between generalisation and diversity. Our results provide guidance on which fine-tuning method should be used depending on the application, and show that more research is needed to improve the tradeoff between generalisation and diversity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available here: https://github.com/facebookresearch/rlfh-gen-div</p></details> |
| **[ODIN: Disentangled Reward Mitigates Hacking in RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07319v1)** | 2024-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we study the issue of reward hacking on the response length, a challenge emerging in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) on LLMs. A well-formatted, verbose but less helpful response from the LLMs can often deceive LLMs or even human evaluators to achieve high scores. The same issue also holds for some reward models in RL. To address the challenges in both training and evaluation, we establish a more reliable evaluation protocol for comparing different training configurations, which inspects the trade-off between LLM evaluation score and response length obtained by varying training hyperparameters. Based on this evaluation, we conduct large-scale studies, where the results shed insights into the efficacy of hyperparameters and tricks used in RL on mitigating length bias. We further propose to improve the reward model by jointly training two linear heads on shared feature representations to predict the rewards, one trained to correlate with length, and the other trained to decorrelate with length and therefore focus more on the actual content. We then discard the length head in RL to prevent reward hacking on length. Experiments demonstrate that our approach almost eliminates the reward correlation with length, and improves the obtained policy by a significant margin.</p></details> |  |

| **[Iterative Data Smoothing: Mitigating Reward Overfitting and Overoptimization in RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16335v1)** | 2024-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is a pivotal technique that aligns language models closely with human-centric values. The initial phase of RLHF involves learning human values using a reward model from ranking data. It is observed that the performance of the reward model degrades after one epoch of training, and optimizing too much against the learned reward model eventually hinders the true objective. This paper delves into these issues, leveraging the theoretical insights to design improved reward learning algorithm termed 'Iterative Data Smoothing' (IDS). The core idea is that during each training epoch, we not only update the model with the data, but also update the date using the model, replacing hard labels with soft labels. Our empirical findings highlight the superior performance of this approach over the traditional methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Secrets of RLHF in Large Language Models Part II: Reward Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06080v2)** | 2024-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has become a crucial technology for aligning language models with human values and intentions, enabling models to produce more helpful and harmless responses. Reward models are trained as proxies for human preferences to drive reinforcement learning optimization. While reward models are often considered central to achieving high performance, they face the following challenges in practical applications: (1) Incorrect and ambiguous preference pairs in the dataset may hinder the reward model from accurately capturing human intent. (2) Reward models trained on data from a specific distribution often struggle to generalize to examples outside that distribution and are not suitable for iterative RLHF training. In this report, we attempt to address these two issues. (1) From a data perspective, we propose a method to measure the strength of preferences within the data, based on a voting mechanism of multiple reward models. Experimental results confirm that data with varying preference strengths have different impacts on reward model performance. We introduce a series of novel methods to mitigate the influence of incorrect and ambiguous preferences in the dataset and fully leverage high-quality preference data. (2) From an algorithmic standpoint, we introduce contrastive learning to enhance the ability of reward models to distinguish between chosen and rejected responses, thereby improving model generalization. Furthermore, we employ meta-learning to enable the reward model to maintain the ability to differentiate subtle differences in out-of-distribution samples, and this approach can be utilized for iterative RLHF optimization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Is RLHF More Difficult than Standard RL?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14111v2)** | 2023-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) learns from preference signals, while standard Reinforcement Learning (RL) directly learns from reward signals. Preferences arguably contain less information than rewards, which makes preference-based RL seemingly more difficult. This paper theoretically proves that, for a wide range of preference models, we can solve preference-based RL directly using existing algorithms and techniques for reward-based RL, with small or no extra costs. Specifically, (1) for preferences that are drawn from reward-based probabilistic models, we reduce the problem to robust reward-based RL that can tolerate small errors in rewards; (2) for general arbitrary preferences where the objective is to find the von Neumann winner, we reduce the problem to multiagent reward-based RL which finds Nash equilibria for factored Markov games with a restricted set of policies. The latter case can be further reduced to adversarial MDP when preferences only depend on the final state. We instantiate all reward-based RL subroutines by concrete provable algorithms, and apply our theory to a large class of models including tabular MDPs and MDPs with generic function approximation. We further provide guarantees when K-wise comparisons are available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation at NeurIPS 2023; 29 pages</p></details> |
| **[Safe RLHF: Safe Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12773v1)** | 2023-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the development of large language models (LLMs), striking a balance between the performance and safety of AI systems has never been more critical. However, the inherent tension between the objectives of helpfulness and harmlessness presents a significant challenge during LLM training. To address this issue, we propose Safe Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (Safe RLHF), a novel algorithm for human value alignment. Safe RLHF explicitly decouples human preferences regarding helpfulness and harmlessness, effectively avoiding the crowdworkers' confusion about the tension and allowing us to train separate reward and cost models. We formalize the safety concern of LLMs as an optimization task of maximizing the reward function while satisfying specified cost constraints. Leveraging the Lagrangian method to solve this constrained problem, Safe RLHF dynamically adjusts the balance between the two objectives during fine-tuning. Through a three-round fine-tuning using Safe RLHF, we demonstrate a superior ability to mitigate harmful responses while enhancing model performance compared to existing value-aligned algorithms. Experimentally, we fine-tuned the Alpaca-7B using Safe RLHF and aligned it with collected human preferences, significantly improving its helpfulness and harmlessness according to human evaluations.</p></details> |  |

An RL Perspective on RLHF, Prompting, and Beyond](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06147v1)** | 2023-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have garnered wide attention and led to successful products such as ChatGPT and GPT-4. Their proficiency in adhering to instructions and delivering harmless, helpful, and honest (3H) responses can largely be attributed to the technique of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). In this paper, we aim to link the research in conventional RL to RL techniques used in LLM research. Demystify this technique by discussing why, when, and how RL excels. Furthermore, we explore potential future avenues that could either benefit from or contribute to RLHF research. Highlighted Takeaways: 1. RLHF is Online Inverse RL with Offline Demonstration Data. 2. RLHF $>$ SFT because Imitation Learning (and Inverse RL) $>$ Behavior Cloning (BC) by alleviating the problem of compounding error. 3. The RM step in RLHF generates a proxy of the expensive human feedback, such an insight can be generalized to other LLM tasks such as prompting evaluation and optimization where feedback is also expensive. 4. The policy learning in RLHF is more challenging than conventional problems studied in IRL due to their high action dimensionality and feedback sparsity. 5. The main superiority of PPO over off-policy value-based methods is its stability gained from (almost) on-policy data and conservative policy updates.</p></details> |  |

It typically consists of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) stages. However, RLHF faces inherent limitations stemming from a complex training setup and its tendency to align the model with implicit values that end users cannot control at run-time. Moreover, reward models in RLHF stage commonly rely on single-dimensional feedback as opposed to explicit, multifaceted signals that indicate attributes such as helpfulness, humor, and toxicity. To address these limitations, we propose SteerLM, a supervised fine-tuning method that empowers end-users to control responses during inference. SteerLM conditions responses to conform to an explicitly defined multi-dimensional set of attributes, thereby empowering a steerable AI capable of generating helpful and high-quality responses while maintaining customizability. Experiments show that SteerLM trained on open source datasets generates responses that are preferred by human and automatic evaluators to many state-of-the-art baselines trained with RLHF while being much easier to train.

A notable subject that is understudied is the (in-)consistency of RMs -- whether they can recognize the semantic changes to different prompts and appropriately adapt their reward assignments -- and their impact on the downstream RLHF model. In this paper, we visit a series of research questions relevant to RM inconsistency: (1) How can we measure the consistency of reward models? (2) How consistent are the existing RMs and how can we improve them? (3) In what ways does reward inconsistency influence the chatbots resulting from the RLHF model training? We propose Contrast Instructions -- a benchmarking strategy for the consistency of RM. Each example in Contrast Instructions features a pair of lexically similar instructions with different ground truth responses. A consistent RM is expected to rank the corresponding instruction and response higher than other combinations. We observe that current RMs trained with the standard ranking objective fail miserably on Contrast Instructions compared to average humans. To show that RM consistency can be improved efficiently without using extra training budget, we propose two techniques ConvexDA and RewardFusion, which enhance reward consistency through extrapolation during the RM training and inference stage, respectively. We show that RLHF models trained with a more consistent RM yield more useful responses, suggesting that reward inconsistency exhibits a trickle-down effect on the downstream RLHF process.</p></details> |  |

To address the multimodal misalignment issue, we adapt the Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) from the text domain to the task of vision-language alignment, where human annotators are asked to compare two responses and pinpoint the more hallucinated one, and the vision-language model is trained to maximize the simulated human rewards. We propose a new alignment algorithm called Factually Augmented RLHF that augments the reward model with additional factual information such as image captions and ground-truth multi-choice options, which alleviates the reward hacking phenomenon in RLHF and further improves the performance. We also enhance the GPT-4-generated training data (for vision instruction tuning) with previously available human-written image-text pairs to improve the general capabilities of our model. To evaluate the proposed approach in real-world scenarios, we develop a new evaluation benchmark MMHAL-BENCH with a special focus on penalizing hallucinations. As the first LMM trained with RLHF, our approach achieves remarkable improvement on the LLaVA-Bench dataset with the 94% performance level of the text-only GPT-4 (while previous best methods can only achieve the 87% level), and an improvement by 60% on MMHAL-BENCH over other baselines.

In this technical report, we empirically investigate an efficient implementation of RLHF using low-rank adaptation (LoRA), which allows us to align the LLaMA 7B checkpoint on the Alpaca dataset using only two A100 GPUs instead of the eight required for full model fine-tuning. Despite tuning only 0.2% of LLaMA 7B's parameters, our implementation achieves better performance than the publicly-released AlpacaFarm checkpoint with full model fine-tuning. Next, we analyze several configurations of our LoRA-based PPO implementation, varying the form of the KL regularization term in the training objective. We find that (1) removing this penalty term does not harm performance on the AlpacaFarm evaluation set under our LoRA setup; (2) other regularizers, such as Jensen-Shannon divergence, lead to improved performance; and (3) while PPO training negatively impacts the factuality of model-generated responses, training with LoRA largely mitigates this effect. We release our code and pretrained checkpoints to facilitate future research on more efficient RLHF.</p></details> |  |

| **[Aligning Multimodal LLM with Human Preference: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14504v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) can handle a wide variety of general tasks with simple prompts, without the need for task-specific training. Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), built upon LLMs, have demonstrated impressive potential in tackling complex tasks involving visual, auditory, and textual data. However, critical issues related to truthfulness, safety, o1-like reasoning, and alignment with human preference remain insufficiently addressed. This gap has spurred the emergence of various alignment algorithms, each targeting different application scenarios and optimization goals. Recent studies have shown that alignment algorithms are a powerful approach to resolving the aforementioned challenges. In this paper, we aim to provide a comprehensive and systematic review of alignment algorithms for MLLMs. Specifically, we explore four key aspects: (1) the application scenarios covered by alignment algorithms, including general image understanding, multi-image, video, and audio, and extended multimodal applications; (2) the core factors in constructing alignment datasets, including data sources, model responses, and preference annotations; (3) the benchmarks used to evaluate alignment algorithms; and (4) a discussion of potential future directions for the development of alignment algorithms. This work seeks to help researchers organize current advancements in the field and inspire better alignment methods.

| **[LLMs as Models for Analogical Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13803v2)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Analogical reasoning-the capacity to identify and map structural relationships between different domains-is fundamental to human cognition and learning. Recent studies have shown that large language models (LLMs) can sometimes match humans in analogical reasoning tasks, opening the possibility that analogical reasoning might emerge from domain general processes. However, it is still debated whether these emergent capacities are largely superficial and limited to simple relations seen during training or whether they rather encompass the flexible representational and mapping capabilities which are the focus of leading cognitive models of analogy. In this study, we introduce novel analogical reasoning tasks that require participants to map between semantically contentful words and sequences of letters and other abstract characters. This task necessitates the ability to flexibly re-represent rich semantic information-an ability which is known to be central to human analogy but which is thus far not well-captured by existing cognitive theories and models. We assess the performance of both human participants and LLMs on tasks focusing on reasoning from semantic structure and semantic content, introducing variations that test the robustness of their analogical inferences. Advanced LLMs match human performance across several conditions, though humans and LLMs respond differently to certain task variations and semantic distractors. Our results thus provide new evidence that LLMs might offer a how-possibly explanation of human analogical reasoning in contexts that are not yet well modeled by existing theories, but that even today's best models are unlikely to yield how-actually explanations.</p></details> | <details><summary>The t...</summary><p>The title has been changed from Semantic Structure-Mapping in LLM and Human Analogical Reasoning to LLMs as Models for Analogical Reasoning to improve clarity and accuracy</p></details> |
| **[DAPO: An Open-Source LLM Reinforcement Learning System at Scale](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14476v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inference scaling empowers LLMs with unprecedented reasoning ability, with reinforcement learning as the core technique to elicit complex reasoning. However, key technical details of state-of-the-art reasoning LLMs are concealed (such as in OpenAI o1 blog and DeepSeek R1 technical report), thus the community still struggles to reproduce their RL training results. We propose the $\textbf{D}$ecoupled Clip and $\textbf{D}$ynamic s$\textbf{A}$mpling $\textbf{P}$olicy $\textbf{O}$ptimization ($\textbf{DAPO}$) algorithm, and fully open-source a state-of-the-art large-scale RL system that achieves 50 points on AIME 2024 using Qwen2.5-32B base model. Unlike previous works that withhold training details, we introduce four key techniques of our algorithm that make large-scale LLM RL a success. In addition, we open-source our training code, which is built on the verl framework, along with a carefully curated and processed dataset. These components of our open-source system enhance reproducibility and support future research in large-scale LLM RL.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://dapo-sia.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[A RAG-based Question Answering System Proposal for Understanding Islam: MufassirQAS LLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15378v5)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Challenges exist in learning and understanding religions, such as the complexity and depth of religious doctrines and teachings. Chatbots as question-answering systems can help in solving these challenges. LLM chatbots use NLP techniques to establish connections between topics and accurately respond to complex questions. These capabilities make it perfect for enlightenment on religion as a question-answering chatbot. However, LLMs also tend to generate false information, known as hallucination. Also, the chatbots' responses can include content that insults personal religious beliefs, interfaith conflicts, and controversial or sensitive topics. It must avoid such cases without promoting hate speech or offending certain groups of people or their beliefs. This study uses a vector database-based Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approach to enhance the accuracy and transparency of LLMs. Our question-answering system is called "MufassirQAS". We created a database consisting of several open-access books that include Turkish context. These books contain Turkish translations and interpretations of Islam. This database is utilized to answer religion-related questions and ensure our answers are trustworthy. The relevant part of the dataset, which LLM also uses, is presented along with the answer. We have put careful effort into creating system prompts that give instructions to prevent harmful, offensive, or disrespectful responses to respect people's values and provide reliable results. The system answers and shares additional information, such as the page number from the respective book and the articles referenced for obtaining the information. MufassirQAS and ChatGPT are also tested with sensitive questions. We got better performance with our system. Study and enhancements are still in progress. Results and future works are given.</p></details> |  |

Traditional automated feature engineering methods are limited by their reliance on pre-defined transformations within fixed, manually designed search spaces, often neglecting domain knowledge. Recent advances using Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled the integration of domain knowledge into the feature engineering process. However, existing LLM-based approaches use direct prompting or rely solely on validation scores for feature selection, failing to leverage insights from prior feature discovery experiments or establish meaningful reasoning between feature generation and data-driven performance. To address these challenges, we propose LLM-FE, a novel framework that combines evolutionary search with the domain knowledge and reasoning capabilities of LLMs to automatically discover effective features for tabular learning tasks. LLM-FE formulates feature engineering as a program search problem, where LLMs propose new feature transformation programs iteratively, and data-driven feedback guides the search process. Our results demonstrate that LLM-FE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, significantly enhancing the performance of tabular prediction models across diverse classification and regression benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[PLAY2PROMPT: Zero-shot Tool Instruction Optimization for LLM Agents via Tool Play](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14432v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated with specialized external tools, yet many tasks demand zero-shot tool usage with minimal or noisy documentation. Existing solutions rely on manual rewriting or labeled data for validation, making them inapplicable in true zero-shot settings. To address these challenges, we propose PLAY2PROMPT, an automated framework that systematically "plays" with each tool to explore its input-output behaviors. Through this iterative trial-and-error process, PLAY2PROMPT refines tool documentation and generates usage examples without any labeled data. These examples not only guide LLM inference but also serve as validation to further enhance tool utilization. Extensive experiments on real-world tasks demonstrate that PLAY2PROMPT significantly improves zero-shot tool performance across both open and closed models, offering a scalable and effective solution for domain-specific tool integration.</p></details> |  |
| **[Navigating LLM Ethics: Advancements, Challenges, and Future Directions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18841v4)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study addresses ethical issues surrounding Large Language Models (LLMs) within the field of artificial intelligence. It explores the common ethical challenges posed by both LLMs and other AI systems, such as privacy and fairness, as well as ethical challenges uniquely arising from LLMs. It highlights challenges such as hallucination, verifiable accountability, and decoding censorship complexity, which are unique to LLMs and distinct from those encountered in traditional AI systems. The study underscores the need to tackle these complexities to ensure accountability, reduce biases, and enhance transparency in the influential role that LLMs play in shaping information dissemination. It proposes mitigation strategies and future directions for LLM ethics, advocating for interdisciplinary collaboration. It recommends ethical frameworks tailored to specific domains and dynamic auditing systems adapted to diverse contexts. This roadmap aims to guide responsible development and integration of LLMs, envisioning a future where ethical considerations govern AI advancements in society.</p></details> |  |
| **[How much do LLMs learn from negative examples?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14391v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) undergo a three-phase training process: unsupervised pre-training, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and learning from human feedback (RLHF/DPO). Notably, it is during the final phase that these models are exposed to negative examples -- incorrect, rejected, or suboptimal responses to queries. This paper delves into the role of negative examples in the training of LLMs, using a likelihood-ratio (Likra) model on multiple-choice question answering benchmarks to precisely manage the influence and the volume of negative examples. Our findings reveal three key insights: (1) During a critical phase in training, Likra with negative examples demonstrates a significantly larger improvement per training example compared to SFT using only positive examples. This leads to a sharp jump in the learning curve for Likra unlike the smooth and gradual improvement of SFT; (2) negative examples that are plausible but incorrect (near-misses) exert a greater influence; and (3) while training with positive examples fails to significantly decrease the likelihood of plausible but incorrect answers, training with negative examples more accurately identifies them. These results indicate a potentially significant role for negative examples in improving accuracy and reducing hallucinations for LLMs.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Good/Evil Reputation Judgment of Celebrities by LLMs via Retrieval Augmented Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14382v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The purpose of this paper is to examine whether large language models (LLMs) can understand what is good and evil with respect to judging good/evil reputation of celebrities. Specifically, we first apply a large language model (namely, ChatGPT) to the task of collecting sentences that mention the target celebrity from articles about celebrities on Web pages. Next, the collected sentences are categorized based on their contents by ChatGPT, where ChatGPT assigns a category name to each of those categories. Those assigned category names are referred to as "aspects" of each celebrity. Then, by applying the framework of retrieval augmented generation (RAG), we show that the large language model is quite effective in the task of judging good/evil reputation of aspects and descriptions of each celebrity. Finally, also in terms of proving the advantages of the proposed method over existing services incorporating RAG functions, we show that the proposed method of judging good/evil of aspects/descriptions of each celebrity significantly outperform an existing service incorporating RAG functions.</p></details> |  |

This task focuses on developing robust classification models to accurately categorize cryptocurrency-related social media posts into predefined classes, including but not limited to objective, positive, negative, etc. Additionally, the task requires participants to identify the most relevant answers from a set of posts in response to specific questions. By leveraging advanced LLMs, this research aims to enhance the understanding and filtering of cryptocurrency discourse, thereby facilitating more informed decision-making in this volatile sector. We have used a prompt-based technique to solve the classification task for reddit posts and twitter posts. Also, we have used 64-shot technique along with prompts on GPT-4-Turbo model to determine whether a answer is relevant to a question or not.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Updated and Final Version</p></details> |
| **[MANTRA: Enhancing Automated Method-Level Refactoring with Contextual RAG and Multi-Agent LLM Collaboration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14340v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Maintaining and scaling software systems relies heavily on effective code refactoring, yet this process remains labor-intensive, requiring developers to carefully analyze existing codebases and prevent the introduction of new defects. Although recent advancements have leveraged Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate refactoring tasks, current solutions are constrained in scope and lack mechanisms to guarantee code compilability and successful test execution. In this work, we introduce MANTRA, a comprehensive LLM agent-based framework that automates method-level refactoring. MANTRA integrates Context-Aware Retrieval-Augmented Generation, coordinated Multi-Agent Collaboration, and Verbal Reinforcement Learning to emulate human decision-making during refactoring while preserving code correctness and readability. Our empirical study, conducted on 703 instances of "pure refactorings" (i.e., code changes exclusively involving structural improvements), drawn from 10 representative Java projects, covers the six most prevalent refactoring operations. Experimental results demonstrate that MANTRA substantially surpasses a baseline LLM model (RawGPT ), achieving an 82.8% success rate (582/703) in producing code that compiles and passes all tests, compared to just 8.7% (61/703) with RawGPT. Moreover, in comparison to IntelliJ's LLM-powered refactoring tool (EM-Assist), MANTRA exhibits a 50% improvement in generating Extract Method transformations. A usability study involving 37 professional developers further shows that refactorings performed by MANTRA are perceived to be as readable and reusable as human-written code, and in certain cases, even more favorable. These results highlight the practical advantages of MANTRA and emphasize the growing potential of LLM-based systems in advancing the automation of software refactoring tasks.</p></details> | 10 pages |

Our approach reduces reliance on large-scale data and incorporates a robot-agnostic pipeline that embodies an LLM. Our framework, InteLiPlan, ensures that the LLM's decision-making capabilities are effectively aligned with robotic functions, enhancing operational robustness and adaptability, while our human-in-the-loop mechanism allows for real-time human intervention when user instruction is required. We evaluate our method in both simulation and on the real Toyota Human Support Robot (HSR). Our method achieves a 93% success rate in the 'fetch me' task completion with failure recovery, highlighting its capability in both failure reasoning and task planning. InteLiPlan achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art large-scale LLM-based robotics planners, while using only real-time onboard computing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging LLMS for Top-Down Sector Allocation In Automated Trading](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09647v2)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a methodology leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for sector-level portfolio allocation through systematic analysis of macroeconomic conditions and market sentiment. Our framework emphasizes top-down sector allocation by processing multiple data streams simultaneously, including policy documents, economic indicators, and sentiment patterns. Empirical results demonstrate superior risk-adjusted returns compared to traditional cross momentum strategies, achieving a Sharpe ratio of 2.51 and portfolio return of 8.79% versus -0.61 and -1.39% respectively. These results suggest that LLM-based systematic macro analysis presents a viable approach for enhancing automated portfolio allocation decisions at the sector level.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modeling Future Conversation Turns to Teach LLMs to Ask Clarifying Questions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13788v2)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) must often respond to highly ambiguous user requests. In such cases, the LLM's best response may be to ask a clarifying question to elicit more information. Existing LLMs often respond by presupposing a single interpretation of such ambiguous requests, frustrating users who intended a different interpretation. We speculate this is caused by current preference data labeling practice, where LLM responses are evaluated only on their prior contexts. To address this, we assign preference labels by simulating their expected outcomes in future turns. This allows LLMs to learn to ask clarifying questions when it can generate responses that are tailored to each user interpretation in future turns. On open-domain QA datasets with multiple annotations, we evaluate systems based on their ability to ask clarifying questions to recover each user's interpretation and expected answer. We compare systems trained using our proposed preference labeling methods against standard methods, which assign preferences based on only prior context. Our method achieves a 5% improvement in F1 measured against the answer set from different interpretations of each query, showing the value of modeling future conversation turns. We further demonstrate that our method can be used to train models to judiciously determine when to ask clarifying questions, directly answering the question when clarification is unnecessary. In our experiments, we find that our method achieves a 3% improvement in accuracy of such judgments over existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at ICLR 2025</p></details> |

Designed with GIS-like interaction and layered visualization, they often challenge non-expert users with complex functionalities and overlapping layers that obscure spatial relationships. We propose a GeoQA Portal using a multi-agent Large Language Model framework for seamless natural language interaction with geospatial data. Complex queries are broken into subtasks handled by specialized agents, retrieving relevant geographic data efficiently. Task plans are shown to users, boosting transparency. The portal supports default and custom data inputs for flexibility. Semantic search via word vector similarity aids data retrieval despite imperfect terms. Case studies, evaluations, and user tests confirm its effectiveness for non-experts, bridging GIS complexity and public access, and offering an intuitive solution for future geoportals.</p></details> |  |
| **[Decision Tree Induction Through LLMs via Semantically-Aware Evolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14217v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decision trees are a crucial class of models offering robust predictive performance and inherent interpretability across various domains, including healthcare, finance, and logistics. However, current tree induction methods often face limitations such as suboptimal solutions from greedy methods or prohibitive computational costs and limited applicability of exact optimization approaches. To address these challenges, we propose an evolutionary optimization method for decision tree induction based on genetic programming (GP). Our key innovation is the integration of semantic priors and domain-specific knowledge about the search space into the optimization algorithm. To this end, we introduce $\texttt{LLEGO}$, a framework that incorporates semantic priors into genetic search operators through the use of Large Language Models (LLMs), thereby enhancing search efficiency and targeting regions of the search space that yield decision trees with superior generalization performance. This is operationalized through novel genetic operators that work with structured natural language prompts, effectively utilizing LLMs as conditional generative models and sources of semantic knowledge. Specifically, we introduce $\textit{fitness-guided}$ crossover to exploit high-performing regions, and $\textit{diversity-guided}$ mutation for efficient global exploration of the search space. These operators are controlled by corresponding hyperparameters that enable a more nuanced balance between exploration and exploitation across the search space. Empirically, we demonstrate across various benchmarks that $\texttt{LLEGO}$ evolves superior-performing trees compared to existing tree induction methods, and exhibits significantly more efficient search performance compared to conventional GP approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>*Liu ...</summary><p>*Liu and Huynh contributed equally.

| **[Can LLMs Enable Verification in Mainstream Programming?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14183v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although formal methods are capable of producing reliable software, they have seen minimal adoption in everyday programming. Automatic code generation using large language models is becoming increasingly widespread, but it rarely considers producing strong correctness guarantees. In this study, we explore the ability of LLMs to produce verified code in three verification languages (Dafny, Nagini, and Verus). To do so, we use manually curated datasets derived from the state-ofthe-art Python benchmark, HumanEval. We also assess what types of information are sufficient to achieve good-quality results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tuning LLM Judge Design Decisions for 1/1000 of the Cost](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17178v3)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) often requires costly human annotations. To address this, LLM-based judges have been proposed, which compare the outputs of two LLMs enabling the ranking of models without human intervention. While several approaches have been proposed, many confounding factors are present between different papers. For instance the model, the prompt and other hyperparameters are typically changed at the same time making apple-to-apple comparisons challenging. In this paper, we propose to systematically analyze and tune hyperparameter of LLM judges. To alleviate the high cost of evaluating a judge, we propose to leverage multi-objective multi-fidelity which allows to find judges that trades accuracy for cost and also reduce significantly the cost of the search. Our method identifies judges that not only outperform existing benchmarks in accuracy and cost-efficiency but also utilize open-weight models, ensuring greater accessibility and reproducibility.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning on LLM Output Signatures for gray-box LLM Behavior Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14043v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved widespread adoption, yet our understanding of their behavior remains limited, particularly in detecting data contamination and hallucinations. While recently proposed probing techniques provide insights through activation analysis, they require "white-box" access to model internals, often unavailable. Current "gray-box" approaches typically analyze only the probability of the actual tokens in the sequence with simple task-specific heuristics. Importantly, these methods overlook the rich information contained in the full token distribution at each processing step. To address these limitations, we propose that gray-box analysis should leverage the complete observable output of LLMs, consisting of both the previously used token probabilities as well as the complete token distribution sequences - a unified data type we term LOS (LLM Output Signature). To this end, we develop a transformer-based approach to process LOS that theoretically guarantees approximation of existing techniques while enabling more nuanced analysis. Our approach achieves superior performance on hallucination and data contamination detection in gray-box settings, significantly outperforming existing baselines. Furthermore, it demonstrates strong transfer capabilities across datasets and LLMs, suggesting that LOS captures fundamental patterns in LLM behavior. Our code is available at: https://github.com/BarSGuy/LLM-Output-Signatures-Network.</p></details> |  |

While they achieve remarkable performance on challenging tasks such as mathematics and coding, they often rely on their internal knowledge to solve problems, which can be inadequate for time-sensitive or knowledge-intensive questions, leading to inaccuracies and hallucinations. To address this, we propose \textbf{R1-Searcher}, a novel two-stage outcome-based RL approach designed to enhance the search capabilities of LLMs. This method allows LLMs to autonomously invoke external search systems to access additional knowledge during the reasoning process. Our framework relies exclusively on RL, without requiring process rewards or distillation for a cold start. % effectively generalizing to out-of-domain datasets and supporting both Base and Instruct models. Our experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms previous strong RAG methods, even when compared to the closed-source GPT-4o-mini.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-based Unit Test Generation for Dynamically-Typed Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14000v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated unit test generation has been widely studied, but generating effective tests for dynamically typed programs remains a significant challenge. Existing approaches, including search-based software testing (SBST) and recent LLM-based methods, often suffer from type errors, leading to invalid inputs and assertion failures, ultimately reducing testing effectiveness. To address this, we propose TypeTest, a novel framework that enhances type correctness in test generation through a vector-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system. TypeTest employs call instance retrieval and feature-based retrieval to infer parameter types accurately and construct valid test inputs. Furthermore, it utilizes the call graph to extract richer contextual information, enabling more accurate assertion generation. In addition, TypeTest incorporates a repair mechanism and iterative test generation, progressively refining test cases to improve coverage. In an evaluation on 125 real-world Python modules, TypeTest achieved an average statement coverage of 86.6% and branch coverage of 76.8%, outperforming state-of-theart tools by 5.4% and 9.3%, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Query Rewriting via LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12918v2)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When complex SQL queries suffer slow executions despite query optimization, DBAs typically invoke automated query rewriting tools to recommend ``lean'' equivalents that are conducive to faster execution. The rewritings are usually achieved via transformation rules, but these rules are limited in scope and difficult to update in a production system. Recently, LLM-based techniques have also been suggested, but they are prone to semantic and syntactic errors. We investigate here how the remarkable cognitive capabilities of LLMs can be leveraged for performant query rewriting while incorporating safeguards and optimizations to ensure correctness and efficiency. Our study shows that these goals can be progressively achieved through incorporation of (a) an ensemble suite of basic prompts, (b) database-sensitive prompts via redundancy removal and selectivity-based rewriting rules, and (c) LLM token probability-guided rewrite paths. Further, a suite of logic-based and statistical tools can be used to check for semantic violations in the rewrites prior to DBA consideration. We have implemented the above LLM-infused techniques in the LITHE system, and evaluated complex analytic queries from standard benchmarks on contemporary database platforms. The results show significant performance improvements for slow queries, with regard to both abstract costing and actual execution, over both SOTA techniques and the native query optimizer. For instance, with TPC-DS on PostgreSQL, the geometric mean of the runtime speedups for slow queries was as high as 18.4 over the native optimizer, whereas SOTA delivered 6 in comparison. Overall, LITHE is a promising step toward viable LLM-based advisory tools for ameliorating enterprise query performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Empowering LLMs in Decision Games through Algorithmic Data Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13980v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited impressive capabilities across numerous domains, yet they often struggle with complex reasoning and decision-making tasks. Decision-making games, which inherently require multifaceted reasoning logic, serve as ideal sandboxes for evaluating and enhancing the reasoning abilities of LLMs. In this work, we first explore whether LLMs can master complex decision-making games through targeted post-training. To this end, we design data synthesis strategies and curate extensive offline datasets from two classic games, Doudizhu and Go. We further develop a suite of techniques to effectively incorporate this data into LLM training, resulting in two novel agents: Mastermind-Dou and Mastermind-Go. Our experimental results demonstrate that these Mastermind LLMs achieve competitive performance in their respective games. Additionally, we explore whether integrating decision-making data can enhance the general reasoning abilities of LLMs. Our findings suggest that such post-training improves certain aspects of reasoning, providing valuable insights for optimizing LLM data collection and synthesis strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Navigating Rifts in Human-LLM Grounding: Study and Benchmark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13975v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language models excel at following instructions but often struggle with the collaborative aspects of conversation that humans naturally employ. This limitation in grounding -- the process by which conversation participants establish mutual understanding -- can lead to outcomes ranging from frustrated users to serious consequences in high-stakes scenarios. To systematically study grounding challenges in human-LLM interactions, we analyze logs from three human-assistant datasets: WildChat, MultiWOZ, and Bing Chat. We develop a taxonomy of grounding acts and build models to annotate and forecast grounding behavior. Our findings reveal significant differences in human-human and human-LLM grounding: LLMs were three times less likely to initiate clarification and sixteen times less likely to provide follow-up requests than humans. Additionally, early grounding failures predicted later interaction breakdowns. Building on these insights, we introduce RIFTS: a benchmark derived from publicly available LLM interaction data containing situations where LLMs fail to initiate grounding. We note that current frontier models perform poorly on RIFTS, highlighting the need to reconsider how we train and prompt LLMs for human interaction. To this end, we develop a preliminary intervention that mitigates grounding failures.</p></details> | 16 pages, 5 figures |

However, in video understanding with multimodal large language models (LLMs), existing methods primarily rely on static features extracted from images sampled at a fixed low frame rate of frame-per-second (FPS) $\leqslant$2, leading to critical visual information loss. In this paper, we introduce F-16, the first multimodal LLM designed for high-frame-rate video understanding. By increasing the frame rate to 16 FPS and compressing visual tokens within each 1-second clip, F-16 efficiently captures dynamic visual features while preserving key semantic information. Experimental results demonstrate that higher frame rates considerably enhance video understanding across multiple benchmarks, providing a new approach to improving video LLMs beyond scaling model size or training data. F-16 achieves state-of-the-art performance among 7-billion-parameter video LLMs on both general and fine-grained video understanding benchmarks, such as Video-MME and TemporalBench. Furthermore, F-16 excels in complex spatiotemporal tasks, including high-speed sports analysis (\textit{e.g.}, basketball, football, gymnastics, and diving), outperforming SOTA proprietary visual models like GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5-pro. Additionally, we introduce a novel decoding method for F-16 that enables highly efficient low-frame-rate inference without requiring model retraining. Upon acceptance, we will release the source code, model checkpoints, and data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Benchmarking LLMs and LLM-based Agents in Practical Vulnerability Detection for Code Repositories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03586v2)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in software vulnerability detection, particularly on function-level benchmarks like Devign and BigVul. However, real-world detection requires interprocedural analysis, as vulnerabilities often emerge through multi-hop function calls rather than isolated functions. While repository-level benchmarks like ReposVul and VulEval introduce interprocedural context, they remain computationally expensive, lack pairwise evaluation of vulnerability fixes, and explore limited context retrieval, limiting their practicality. We introduce JitVul, a JIT vulnerability detection benchmark linking each function to its vulnerability-introducing and fixing commits. Built from 879 CVEs spanning 91 vulnerability types, JitVul enables comprehensive evaluation of detection capabilities. Our results show that ReAct Agents, leveraging thought-action-observation and interprocedural context, perform better than LLMs in distinguishing vulnerable from benign code. While prompting strategies like Chain-of-Thought help LLMs, ReAct Agents require further refinement. Both methods show inconsistencies, either misidentifying vulnerabilities or over-analyzing security guards, indicating significant room for improvement.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents SagaLLM, a structured multi-agent framework that addresses four fundamental limitations in current LLM approaches: inadequate self-validation, context narrowing, lacking transaction properties, and insufficient inter-agent coordination. By implementing specialized context management agents and validation protocols, SagaLLM preserves critical constraints and state information throughout complex planning processes, enabling robust and consistent decision-making even during disruptions. We evaluate our approach using selected problems from the REALM benchmark, focusing on sequential and reactive planning scenarios that challenge both context retention and adaptive reasoning. Our experiments with state-of-the-art LLMs, Claude 3.7, DeepSeek R1, GPT-4o, and GPT-o1, demonstrate that while these models exhibit impressive reasoning capabilities, they struggle with maintaining global constraint awareness during complex planning tasks, particularly when adapting to unexpected changes. In contrast, the distributed cognitive architecture of SagaLLM shows significant improvements in planning consistency, constraint enforcement, and adaptation to disruptions in various scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 8 tables, 5 figures</p></details> |

However, manual translation is cumbersome, error-prone, and produces unidiomatic code. Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated promise in producing idiomatic translations, but offer no correctness guarantees as they lack the ability to capture all the semantics differences between the source and target languages. To resolve this issue, we propose SACTOR, an LLM-driven C-to-Rust zero-shot translation tool using a two-step translation methodology: an "unidiomatic" step to translate C into Rust while preserving semantics, and an "idiomatic" step to refine the code to follow Rust's semantic standards. SACTOR utilizes information provided by static analysis of the source C program to address challenges such as pointer semantics and dependency resolution. To validate the correctness of the translated result from each step, we use end-to-end testing via the foreign function interface to embed our translated code segment into the original code. We evaluate the translation of 200 programs from two datasets and two case studies, comparing the performance of GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini 2.0 Flash, Llama 3.3 70B and DeepSeek-R1 in SACTOR. Our results demonstrate that SACTOR achieves high correctness and improved idiomaticity, with the best-performing model (DeepSeek-R1) reaching 93% and (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5, DeepSeek-R1) reaching 84% correctness (on each dataset, respectively), while producing more natural and Rust-compliant translations compared to existing methods.</p></details> | 22 pages, 13 figures |

While large language models (LLMs) show promise in automating manuscript critiques, their ability to synthesize high-stakes meta-reviews, which require conflict-aware reasoning and consensus derivation, remains underdeveloped. Existing methods fail to effectively handle conflicting viewpoints within differing opinions, and often introduce additional cognitive biases, such as anchoring effects and conformity bias.To overcome these limitations, we propose the Cognitive Alignment Framework (CAF), a dual-process architecture that transforms LLMs into adaptive scientific arbitrators. By operationalizing Kahneman's dual-process theory, CAF introduces a three-step cognitive pipeline: review initialization, incremental integration, and cognitive alignment.Empirical validation shows that CAF outperforms existing LLM-based methods, with sentiment consistency gains reaching up to 19.47\% and content consistency improving by as much as 12.95\%.</p></details> | 23 pages |

LLMs are trained on multilingual data, but their reasoning abilities are mainly evaluated using English datasets. Hence, robust evaluation frameworks are needed using high-quality non-English datasets, especially low-resource languages (LRLs). This study evaluates eight state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs on Latvian and Giriama using a Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) subset curated with native speakers for linguistic and cultural relevance. Giriama is benchmarked for the first time. Our evaluation shows that OpenAI's o1 model outperforms others across all languages, scoring 92.8% in English, 88.8% in Latvian, and 70.8% in Giriama on 0-shot tasks. Mistral-large (35.6%) and Llama-70B IT (41%) have weak performance, on both Latvian and Giriama. Our results underscore the need for localized benchmarks and human evaluations in advancing cultural AI contextualization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NoDaLiDa/Baltic-HLT 2025. https://hdl.handle.net/10062/107190</p></details> |

However, challenges remain in Multi-Disciplinary Team (MDT) medical consultations. Current research enhances reasoning through role assignment, task decomposition, and accumulation of medical experience. Multi-role collaboration in MDT consultations often results in excessively long dialogue histories. This increases the model's cognitive burden and degrades both efficiency and accuracy. Some methods only store treatment histories. They do not extract effective experience or reflect on errors. This limits knowledge generalization and system evolution. We propose a multi-agent MDT medical consultation framework based on LLMs to address these issues. Our framework uses consensus aggregation and a residual discussion structure for multi-round consultations. It also employs a Correct Answer Knowledge Base (CorrectKB) and a Chain-of-Thought Knowledge Base (ChainKB) to accumulate consultation experience. These mechanisms enable the framework to evolve and continually improve diagnosis rationality and accuracy. Experimental results on the MedQA and PubMedQA datasets demonstrate that our framework achieves accuracies of 90.1% and 83.9%, respectively, and that the constructed knowledge bases generalize effectively across test sets from both datasets.</p></details> | 24 pages |

Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable generalization capabilities across diverse domains, including natural language processing (NLP), computer vision (CV), and beyond. In this article, we propose an LLM-empowered IoT architecture for 6G networks to achieve intelligent autonomy while supporting advanced IoT applications. LLMs are pushed to the edge of the 6G network to support the synergy of LLMs and IoT. LLM solutions are tailored to both IoT application requirements and IoT management needs, i.e., LLM for IoT. On the other hand, edge inference and edge fine-tuning are discussed to support the deployment of LLMs, i.e., LLM on IoT. Furthermore, we propose a memory-efficient split federated learning (SFL) framework for LLM fine-tuning on heterogeneous IoT devices that alleviates memory pressures on both IoT devices and the edge server while achieving comparable performance and convergence time. Finally, a case study is presented, followed by a discussion about open issues of LLM-empowered IoT for 6G networks.</p></details> |  |

Local pruning performs efficient layer-by-layer compression but ignores global topology. Global pruning has the potential to find the optimal solution although resource-intensive. However, existing methods tend to rank structural saliency uniformly, ignoring inter-structure dependencies and failing to achieve end-to-end optimization. To address these limitations, we propose T\'yr-the-Pruner, an efficient end-to-end search-based global structural pruning framework. This framework constructs a supernet by repeatedly applying local pruning across a range of sparsity ratios to each layer in an LLM, with the core goal of determining the optimal sparsity distribution under a target overall sparsity ratio. Concretely, we introduce an effective local pruning and an expectation error accumulation approach to improve supernet construction. Furthermore, we employ an iterative prune-and-search strategy with coarse-to-fine sparsity granularity to ensure efficient search convergence. Experimental results show that T\'yr-the-Pruner achieves state-of-the-art structural pruning, retaining 97% of the dense model's performance while removing a challenging 50% of Llama-3.1-70B's parameters.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we explore the use of large language model (LLM) personas to introduce missing perspectives in policy deliberations. We develop and evaluate a tool that transcribes conversations in real-time and simulates input from relevant but absent stakeholders. We deploy this tool in a 19-person student citizens' assembly on campus sustainability. Participants and facilitators found that the tool sparked new discussions and surfaced valuable perspectives they had not previously considered. However, they also noted that AI-generated responses were sometimes overly general. They raised concerns about overreliance on AI for perspective-taking. Our findings highlight both the promise and potential risks of using LLMs to raise missing points of view in group deliberation settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[SPIN-Bench: How Well Do LLMs Plan Strategically and Reason Socially?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12349v2)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning and strategic behavior in social interactions is a hallmark of intelligence. This form of reasoning is significantly more sophisticated than isolated planning or reasoning tasks in static settings (e.g., math problem solving). In this paper, we present Strategic Planning, Interaction, and Negotiation (SPIN-Bench), a new multi-domain evaluation designed to measure the intelligence of strategic planning and social reasoning. While many existing benchmarks focus on narrow planning or single-agent reasoning, SPIN-Bench combines classical PDDL tasks, competitive board games, cooperative card games, and multi-agent negotiation scenarios in one unified framework. The framework includes both a benchmark as well as an arena to simulate and evaluate the variety of social settings to test reasoning and strategic behavior of AI agents. We formulate the benchmark SPIN-Bench by systematically varying action spaces, state complexity, and the number of interacting agents to simulate a variety of social settings where success depends on not only methodical and step-wise decision making, but also conceptual inference of other (adversarial or cooperative) participants. Our experiments reveal that while contemporary LLMs handle basic fact retrieval and short-range planning reasonably well, they encounter significant performance bottlenecks in tasks requiring deep multi-hop reasoning over large state spaces and socially adept coordination under uncertainty. We envision SPIN-Bench as a catalyst for future research on robust multi-agent planning, social reasoning, and human--AI teaming.

However, this may lead to biased synthetic data and overfitting to specific configurations. It can sidestep biases of manually curated data generation by directly leveraging hidden states of Large Language Models (LLMs), which is surprisingly rarely explored. This paper presents a systematic method to enhance visual grounding by utilizing decoder layers of the LLM of a MLLM. We introduce a zero-initialized cross-attention adapter to enable efficient knowledge transfer from LLMs to object detectors, an new approach called LED (LLM Enhanced Open-Vocabulary Object Detection). We demonstrate that intermediate hidden states from early LLM layers retain strong spatial-semantic correlations that are beneficial to grounding tasks. Experiments show that our adaptation strategy significantly enhances the performance on complex free-form text queries while remaining the same on plain categories. With our adaptation, Qwen2-0.5B with Swin-T as the vision encoder improves GroundingDINO by 2.33% on Omnilabel, at the overhead of 8.7% more GFLOPs. Qwen2-0.5B with a larger vision encoder can further boost the performance by 6.22%. We further validate our design by ablating on varied adapter architectures, sizes of LLMs, and which layers to add adaptation.</p></details> |  |

As these models become more integral to critical processes, ensuring their reliability and trustworthiness becomes essential. Consequently, the concept of trust in these systems is becoming increasingly critical. Well-calibrated trust is important, as excessive trust can lead to security vulnerabilities, and risks, while insufficient trust can hinder innovation. However, the landscape of trust-related concepts in LLMs in SE is relatively unclear, with concepts such as trust, distrust, and trustworthiness lacking clear conceptualizations in the SE community. To bring clarity to the current research status and identify opportunities for future work, we conducted a comprehensive review of $88$ papers: a systematic literature review of $18$ papers focused on LLMs in SE, complemented by an analysis of 70 papers from broader trust literature. Additionally, we conducted a survey study with 25 domain experts to gain insights into practitioners' understanding of trust and identify gaps between existing literature and developers' perceptions. The result of our analysis serves as a roadmap that covers trust-related concepts in LLMs in SE and highlights areas for future exploration.</p></details> |  |
| **["Well, Keep Thinking": Enhancing LLM Reasoning with Adaptive Injection Decoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10167v2)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) exhibit strong reasoning abilities, often attributed to few-shot or zero-shot chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting. While effective, these methods require labor-intensive prompt engineering, raising the question of whether reasoning can be induced without reliance on explicit prompts. In this work, we unlock the reasoning capabilities of LLMs without explicit prompting. Inspired by zero-shot CoT and CoT-decoding, we propose a novel decoding strategy that systematically nudges LLMs to continue reasoning, thereby preventing immature reasoning processes. Specifically, we monitor the model's generation and inject a designated phrase whenever it is likely to conclude its response prematurely, before completing the reasoning process. Our experimental evaluations on diverse reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed strategy substantially improves LLM reasoning capabilities, highlighting the potential of decoding-based interventions as an alternative to traditional prompting techniques.</p></details> |  |

However, satisfying both TTFT and TBT service-level objectives (SLOs) is challenging. To address this, we propose a system, named CacheOPT for mitigating KV Cache competition, based on key insights from our measurements, incorporating novel components. First, it estimates a request's output length, bounding the deviation with a high specified probability, adjusted based on the request arrival rate. Second, it allocates the estimated KVC demand to a request, and reuses other requests' allocated KVC to avoid preemptions while reducing waiting time. Third, it proactively allocates KVC before instead of at the time a request exhausts its allocation and reserves KVC globally to prevent preemptions. Fourth, it chooses a request that has long TBT SLO, long job remaining time and short preemption time to preempt. Fifth, it selects the shortest-latency strategy between swapping and recomputation for preemptions. Experiments show that CacheOPT achieves up to 3.29$\times$ and 2.83$\times$ lower tail TBT and tail TTFT, 47\% and 53\% higher TTFT and TBT SLO attainments, and supports up to 1.58$\times$ higher request arrival rate than the state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

To improve throughput when handling long prompts, previous research introduces a chunking method, but has not addressed heterogeneous SLOs. To address the limitation, we propose AccelGen, a high-throughput LLM inference serving system with heterogeneous SLO guarantees for diverse applications. AccelGen introduces four core components: (1) SLO-guaranteed dynamic chunking, which dynamically adjusts chunk sizes to maximize GPU compute utilization while meeting iteration-level SLOs; (2) Iteration-level SLO-based task prioritization, which prioritizes tight-SLO requests and batches requests with similar SLOs; (3) Multi-resource-aware batching, which selects queued requests to maximize the utilizations of both GPU compute resource and key-value cache (KVC). Trace-driven real experiments demonstrate that AccelGen achieves 1.42-11.21X higher throughput, 1.43-13.71X higher goodput, 37-90% higher SLO attainment, and 1.61-12.22X lower response latency compared to the state-of-the-art approaches. It achieves performance near the Oracle, which optimally maximizes goodput.</p></details> |  |

AutoEval is the first benchmarking paradigm that offers several key advantages necessary for scaling objective evaluation of LLMs without human labeling: (a) ability to evaluate LLMs of increasing sophistication by auto-generating tasks at different levels of difficulty; (b) auto-generation of ground truth that eliminates dependence on expensive and time-consuming human annotation; (c) the use of automatically generated, randomized datasets that mitigate the ability of successive LLMs to overfit to static datasets used in many contemporary benchmarks. Empirical analysis shows that an LLM's performance on AutoEval is highly indicative of its performance on a diverse array of other benchmarks focusing on translation and reasoning tasks, making it a valuable autonomous evaluation paradigm in settings where hand-curated datasets can be hard to obtain and/or update.</p></details> |  |

However, achieving strong performance in specialized domains like mathematical reasoning and non-English languages often requires extensive training on massive datasets. This paper investigates a contrasting approach: strategic fine-tuning on a small, high-quality, bilingual (English-French) dataset to enhance both the reasoning capabilities and French language proficiency of a large language model. Rather than relying on scale, we explore the hypothesis that targeted data curation and optimized training can achieve competitive, or even superior, performance. We demonstrate, through targeted supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on only 2,000 carefully selected samples, significant improvements in mathematical reasoning. Specifically, Pensez 7B exhibits an increase in accuracy of the base model up to 20% on the AIME25 and a 12% increase on a French MATH level 5 benchmark. These results challenge the prevailing assumption that massive datasets are aprerequisite for strong reasoning performance in LLMs, highlighting the potential of strategic data curation and optimized fine-tuning for enhancing both specialized skills and multilingual capabilities. Our findings have implications for the efficient development of high-performing, multilingual LLMs, especially in resource-constrained scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Why Do Multi-Agent LLM Systems Fail?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13657v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite growing enthusiasm for Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), where multiple LLM agents collaborate to accomplish tasks, their performance gains across popular benchmarks remain minimal compared to single-agent frameworks. This gap highlights the need to analyze the challenges hindering MAS effectiveness. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study of MAS challenges. We analyze five popular MAS frameworks across over 150 tasks, involving six expert human annotators. We identify 14 unique failure modes and propose a comprehensive taxonomy applicable to various MAS frameworks. This taxonomy emerges iteratively from agreements among three expert annotators per study, achieving a Cohen's Kappa score of 0.88. These fine-grained failure modes are organized into 3 categories, (i) specification and system design failures, (ii) inter-agent misalignment, and (iii) task verification and termination. To support scalable evaluation, we integrate MASFT with LLM-as-a-Judge. We also explore if identified failures could be easily prevented by proposing two interventions: improved specification of agent roles and enhanced orchestration strategies. Our findings reveal that identified failures require more complex solutions, highlighting a clear roadmap for future research. We open-source our dataset and LLM annotator.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we conduct a comprehensive counterfactual faithfulness analysis across 62 models from 8 families, encompassing both pretrained and instruction-tuned variants and significantly extending prior studies of counterfactual tests. We introduce phi-CCT, a simplified variant of the Correlational Counterfactual Test, which avoids the need for token probabilities while explaining most of the variance of the original test. Our findings reveal clear scaling trends: larger models are consistently more faithful on our metrics. However, when comparing instruction-tuned and human-imitated explanations, we find that observed differences in faithfulness can often be attributed to explanation verbosity, leading to shifts along the true-positive/false-positive Pareto frontier. While instruction-tuning and prompting can influence this trade-off, we find limited evidence that they fundamentally expand the frontier of explanatory faithfulness beyond what is achievable with pretrained models of comparable size. Our analysis highlights the nuanced relationship between instruction-tuning, verbosity, and the faithful representation of model decision processes.</p></details> | 38 pages, 9 figures |

Therefore, inference speed is one of the most critical properties of LLM architectures, and there is a growing need for LLMs that are efficient and fast at inference. Recently, LLMs built on the xLSTM architecture have emerged as a powerful alternative to Transformers, offering linear compute scaling with sequence length and constant memory usage, both highly desirable properties for efficient inference. However, such xLSTM-based LLMs have yet to be scaled to larger models and assessed and compared with respect to inference speed and efficiency. In this work, we introduce xLSTM 7B, a 7-billion-parameter LLM that combines xLSTM's architectural benefits with targeted optimizations for fast and efficient inference. Our experiments demonstrate that xLSTM 7B achieves performance on downstream tasks comparable to other similar-sized LLMs, while providing significantly faster inference speeds and greater efficiency compared to Llama- and Mamba-based LLMs. These results establish xLSTM 7B as the fastest and most efficient 7B LLM, offering a solution for tasks that require large amounts of test-time computation. Our work highlights xLSTM's potential as a foundational architecture for methods building on heavy use of LLM inference.

This paper introduces an innovative approach\footnote{A lightweight, mock version of the code is available on GitHub at that combines a multi-agent framework with the Network Simulator 3 (ns-3) to automate and optimize the generation, debugging, execution, and analysis of complex 5G network scenarios. Our framework orchestrates a suite of specialized agents -- namely, the Simulation Generation Agent, Test Designer Agent, Test Executor Agent, and Result Interpretation Agent -- using advanced LangChain coordination. The Simulation Generation Agent employs a structured chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning process, leveraging LLMs and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to translate natural language simulation specifications into precise ns-3 scripts. Concurrently, the Test Designer Agent generates comprehensive automated test suites by integrating knowledge retrieval techniques with dynamic test case synthesis. The Test Executor Agent dynamically deploys and runs simulations, managing dependencies and parsing detailed performance metrics. At the same time, the Result Interpretation Agent utilizes LLM-driven analysis to extract actionable insights from the simulation outputs. By integrating external resources such as library documentation and ns-3 testing frameworks, our experimental approach can enhance simulation accuracy and adaptability, reducing reliance on extensive programming expertise. A detailed case study using the ns-3 5G-LENA module validates the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The code generation process converges in an average of 1.8 iterations, has a syntax error rate of 17.0%, a mean response time of 7.3 seconds, and receives a human evaluation score of 7.5.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

While Large Language Models (LLMs) have made strides in code generation, they struggle to achieve high branch coverage due to their limited ability to reason about intricate control flow structures. To address this limitation, we introduce Panta, a technique that emulates the iterative process human developers follow when analyzing code and constructing test cases. Panta integrates static control flow analysis and dynamic code coverage analysis to systematically guide LLMs in identifying uncovered execution paths and generating better test cases. By incorporating an iterative feedback-driven mechanism, our technique continuously refines test generation based on static and dynamic path coverage insights, ensuring more comprehensive and effective testing. Our empirical evaluation, conducted on classes with high cyclomatic complexity from open-source projects, demonstrates that Panta achieves 26% higher line coverage and 23% higher branch coverage compared to the state-of-the-art.</p></details> |  |

However, existing works focus mainly on the chest region. Few works have been investigated on abdominal radiology reports due to more complex anatomy and a wider range of pathologies in the abdomen. We propose LEAVS (Large language model Extractor for Abdominal Vision Supervision). This labeler can annotate the certainty of presence and the urgency of seven types of abnormalities for nine abdominal organs on CT radiology reports. To ensure broad coverage, we chose abnormalities that encompass most of the finding types from CT reports. Our approach employs a specialized chain-of-thought prompting strategy for a locally-run LLM using sentence extraction and multiple-choice questions in a tree-based decision system. We demonstrate that the LLM can extract several abnormality types across abdominal organs with an average F1 score of 0.89, significantly outperforming competing labelers and humans. Additionally, we show that extraction of urgency labels achieved performance comparable to human annotations. Finally, we demonstrate that the abnormality labels contain valuable information for training a single vision model that classifies several organs as normal or abnormal. We release our code and structured annotations for a public CT dataset containing over 1,000 CT volumes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Computation Mechanism Behind LLM Position Generalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13305v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most written natural languages are composed of sequences of words and sentences. Similar to humans, large language models (LLMs) exhibit flexibility in handling textual positions - a phenomenon we term position generalization. They can understand texts with position perturbations and generalize to longer texts than those encountered during training with the latest techniques. These phenomena suggest that LLMs handle positions tolerantly, but how LLMs computationally process positional relevance remains largely unexplored. This work connects the linguistic phenomenon with LLMs' computational mechanisms. We show how LLMs enforce certain computational mechanisms for the aforementioned tolerance in position perturbations. Despite the complex design of the self-attention mechanism, this work reveals that LLMs learn a counterintuitive disentanglement of attention logits. Their values show a 0.959 linear correlation with an approximation of the arithmetic sum of positional relevance and semantic importance. Furthermore, we identify a prevalent pattern in intermediate features, which we prove theoretically enables this effect. The pattern, which is different from how randomly initialized parameters would behave, suggests that it is a learned behavior rather than a natural result of the model architecture. Based on these findings, we provide computational explanations and criteria for LLMs' position flexibilities. This work takes a pioneering step in linking position generalization with modern LLMs' internal mechanisms.</p></details> | 8 pages |

However, the manual, knowledge-intensive design process and the lack of high-quality circuit netlists have significantly constrained design space exploration and optimization to behavioral system-level tools. In this work, we introduce LIMCA, a novel fine-tune-free Large Language Model (LLM)-driven framework for automating the design and evaluation of IMC crossbar architectures. Unlike traditional approaches, LIMCA employs a No-Human-In-Loop (NHIL) automated pipeline to generate and validate circuit netlists for SPICE simulations, eliminating manual intervention. LIMCA systematically explores the IMC design space by leveraging a structured dataset and LLM-based performance evaluation. Our experimental results on MNIST classification demonstrate that LIMCA successfully generates crossbar designs achieving $\geq$96% accuracy while maintaining a power consumption $\leq$3W, making this the first work in LLM-assisted IMC design space exploration. Compared to existing frameworks, LIMCA provides an automated, scalable, and hardware-aware solution, reducing design exploration time while ensuring user-constrained performance trade-offs.</p></details> | 4 Figures, 5 Tables |

Current LLM selection methods often struggle to generalize across new LLMs and different tasks because of their limited ability to leverage contextual interactions among tasks, queries, and LLMs, as well as their dependence on a transductive learning framework. To address these shortcomings, we introduce a novel inductive graph framework, named as GraphRouter, which fully utilizes the contextual information among tasks, queries, and LLMs to enhance the LLM selection process. GraphRouter constructs a heterogeneous graph comprising task, query, and LLM nodes, with interactions represented as edges, which efficiently captures the contextual information between the query's requirements and the LLM's capabilities. Through an innovative edge prediction mechanism, GraphRouter is able to predict attributes (the effect and cost of LLM response) of potential edges, allowing for optimized recommendations that adapt to both existing and newly introduced LLMs without requiring retraining. Comprehensive experiments across three distinct effect-cost weight scenarios have shown that GraphRouter substantially surpasses existing routers, delivering a minimum performance improvement of 12.3%. In addition, it achieves enhanced generalization across new LLMs settings and supports diverse tasks with at least a 9.5% boost in effect and a significant reduction in computational demands. This work endeavors to apply a graph-based approach for the contextual and adaptive selection of LLMs, offering insights for real-world applications. Our codes for GraphRouter is released at https://github.com/ulab-uiuc/GraphRouter.</p></details> |  |

However, current gaze-based assistive systems mainly help users with basic grasping actions, offering limited support. Moreover, the restricted intent recognition capability constrains the assistive system's ability to provide diverse assistance functions. In this paper, we propose an open implicit intention recognition framework powered by Large Language Model (LLM) and Vision Foundation Model (VFM), which can process gaze input and recognize user intents that are not confined to predefined or specific scenarios. Furthermore, we implement a gaze-driven LLM-enhanced assistive robot system (MindEye-OmniAssist) that recognizes user's intentions through gaze and assists in completing task. To achieve this, the system utilizes open vocabulary object detector, intention recognition network and LLM to infer their full intentions. By integrating eye movement feedback and LLM, it generates action sequences to assist the user in completing tasks. Real-world experiments have been conducted for assistive tasks, and the system achieved an overall success rate of 41/55 across various undefined tasks. Preliminary results show that the proposed method holds the potential to provide a more user-friendly human-computer interaction interface and significantly enhance the versatility and effectiveness of assistive systems by supporting more complex and diverse task.</p></details> |  |

Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance in natural language understanding and generation tasks. However, they often suffer from limitations such as difficulty in incorporating new knowledge, generating hallucinations, and explaining their reasoning process. To address these challenges, integrating knowledge graphs with Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Graph RAG) has emerged as an effective solution. Traditional Graph RAG methods often rely on simple graph traversal or semantic similarity, which do not capture causal relationships or align well with the model's internal reasoning steps. This paper proposes a novel pipeline that filters large knowledge graphs to emphasize cause-effect edges, aligns the retrieval process with the model's chain-of-thought (CoT), and enhances reasoning through multi-stage path improvements. Experiments on medical question-answering tasks show consistent gains, with up to a 10\% absolute improvement across multiple large language models (LLMs). This approach demonstrates the value of combining causal reasoning with stepwise retrieval, leading to more interpretable and logically grounded solutions for complex queries.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Assessing the Robustness of LLM-based NLP Software via Automated Testing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21016v2)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Benefiting from the advancements in LLMs, NLP software has undergone rapid development. Such software is widely employed in various safety-critical tasks, such as financial sentiment analysis, toxic content moderation, and log generation. Unlike traditional software, LLM-based NLP software relies on prompts and examples as inputs. Given the complexity of LLMs and the unpredictability of real-world inputs, quantitatively assessing the robustness of such software is crucial. However, to the best of our knowledge, no automated robustness testing methods have been specifically designed to evaluate the overall inputs of LLM-based NLP software. To this end, this paper introduces the first AutOmated Robustness Testing frAmework, AORTA, which reconceptualizes the testing process into a combinatorial optimization problem. Existing testing methods designed for DNN-based software can be applied to LLM-based software by AORTA, but their effectiveness is limited. To address this, we propose a novel testing method for LLM-based software within AORTA called Adaptive Beam Search. ABS is tailored for the expansive feature space of LLMs and improves testing effectiveness through an adaptive beam width and the capability for backtracking. We successfully embed 18 test methods in the designed framework AORTA and compared the test validity of ABS with three datasets and five threat models. ABS facilitates a more comprehensive and accurate robustness assessment before software deployment, with an average test success rate of 86.138%. Compared to the currently best-performing baseline PWWS, ABS significantly reduces the computational overhead by up to 3441.895 seconds per successful test case and decreases the number of queries by 218.762 times on average. Furthermore, test cases generated by ABS exhibit greater naturalness and transferability.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-based speaker diarization correction: A generalizable approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04927v3)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Speaker diarization is necessary for interpreting conversations transcribed using automated speech recognition (ASR) tools. Despite significant developments in diarization methods, diarization accuracy remains an issue. Here, we investigate the use of large language models (LLMs) for diarization correction as a post-processing step. LLMs were fine-tuned using the Fisher corpus, a large dataset of transcribed conversations. The ability of the models to improve diarization accuracy in a holdout dataset from the Fisher corpus as well as an independent dataset was measured. We report that fine-tuned LLMs can markedly improve diarization accuracy. However, model performance is constrained to transcripts produced using the same ASR tool as the transcripts used for fine-tuning, limiting generalizability. To address this constraint, an ensemble model was developed by combining weights from three separate models, each fine-tuned using transcripts from a different ASR tool. The ensemble model demonstrated better overall performance than each of the ASR-specific models, suggesting that a generalizable and ASR-agnostic approach may be achievable. We have made the weights of these models publicly available on HuggingFace at https://huggingface.co/bklynhlth.</p></details> |  |
| **[Are LLMs (Really) Ideological? An IRT-based Analysis and Alignment Tool for Perceived Socio-Economic Bias in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13149v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce an Item Response Theory (IRT)-based framework to detect and quantify socioeconomic bias in large language models (LLMs) without relying on subjective human judgments. Unlike traditional methods, IRT accounts for item difficulty, improving ideological bias estimation. We fine-tune two LLM families (Meta-LLaMa 3.2-1B-Instruct and Chat- GPT 3.5) to represent distinct ideological positions and introduce a two-stage approach: (1) modeling response avoidance and (2) estimating perceived bias in answered responses. Our results show that off-the-shelf LLMs often avoid ideological engagement rather than exhibit bias, challenging prior claims of partisanship. This empirically validated framework enhances AI alignment research and promotes fairer AI governance.</p></details> |  |
| **[VeriLeaky: Navigating IP Protection vs Utility in Fine-Tuning for LLM-Driven Verilog Coding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13116v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) offer significant potential for coding, yet fine-tuning (FT) with curated data is essential for niche languages like Verilog. Using proprietary intellectual property (IP) for FT presents a serious risk, as FT data can be leaked through LLM inference. This leads to a critical dilemma for design houses: seeking to build externally accessible LLMs offering competitive Verilog coding, how can they leverage in-house IP to enhance FT utility while ensuring IP protection? For the first time in the literature, we study this dilemma. Using LLaMA 3.1-8B, we conduct in-house FT on a baseline Verilog dataset (RTLCoder) supplemented with our own in-house IP, which is validated through multiple tape-outs. To rigorously assess IP leakage, we quantify structural similarity (AST/Dolos) and functional equivalence (Synopsys Formality) between generated codes and our in-house IP. We show that our IP can indeed be leaked, confirming the threat. As defense, we evaluate logic locking of Verilog codes (ASSURE). This offers some level of protection, yet reduces the IP's utility for FT and degrades the LLM's performance. Our study shows the need for novel strategies that are both effective and minimally disruptive to FT, an essential effort for enabling design houses to fully utilize their proprietary IP toward LLM-driven Verilog coding.</p></details> |  |

However, concerns about data contamination - where benchmark data inadvertently leaks into pre-training or fine-tuning datasets - raise questions about the validity of these evaluations. While this issue is known, limiting the industrial adoption of LLM-driven software engineering, hardware coding has received little to no attention regarding these risks. For the first time, we analyze state-of-the-art (SOTA) evaluation frameworks for Verilog code generation (VerilogEval and RTLLM), using established methods for contamination detection (CCD and Min-K% Prob). We cover SOTA commercial and open-source LLMs (CodeGen2.5, Minitron 4b, Mistral 7b, phi-4 mini, LLaMA-{1,2,3.1}, GPT-{2,3.5,4o}, Deepseek-Coder, and CodeQwen 1.5), in baseline and fine-tuned models (RTLCoder and Verigen). Our study confirms that data contamination is a critical concern. We explore mitigations and the resulting trade-offs for code quality vs fairness (i.e., reducing contamination toward unbiased benchmarking).</p></details> |  |
| **[A Framework to Assess Multilingual Vulnerabilities of LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13081v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are acquiring a wider range of capabilities, including understanding and responding in multiple languages. While they undergo safety training to prevent them from answering illegal questions, imbalances in training data and human evaluation resources can make these models more susceptible to attacks in low-resource languages (LRL). This paper proposes a framework to automatically assess the multilingual vulnerabilities of commonly used LLMs. Using our framework, we evaluated six LLMs across eight languages representing varying levels of resource availability. We validated the assessments generated by our automated framework through human evaluation in two languages, demonstrating that the framework's results align with human judgments in most cases. Our findings reveal vulnerabilities in LRL; however, these may pose minimal risk as they often stem from the model's poor performance, resulting in incoherent responses.</p></details> |  |

However, leveraging the ICL capabilities within LLMs to directly predict robot actions remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce RoboPrompt, a framework that enables off-the-shelf text-only LLMs to directly predict robot actions through ICL without training. Our approach first heuristically identifies keyframes that capture important moments from an episode. Next, we extract end-effector actions from these keyframes as well as the estimated initial object poses, and both are converted into textual descriptions. Finally, we construct a structured template to form ICL demonstrations from these textual descriptions and a task instruction. This enables an LLM to directly predict robot actions at test time. Through extensive experiments and analysis, RoboPrompt shows stronger performance over zero-shot and ICL baselines in simulated and real-world settings.

As large language models (LLMs) grow popular in both academia and industry, how to effectively evaluate the capacity of LLMs becomes an increasingly critical but still challenging issue. Existing methods can be divided into two types: manual evaluation, which is expensive, and automatic evaluation, which faces many limitations including task format (the majority belong to multiple-choice questions) and evaluation criteria (occupied by reference-based metrics). To advance the innovation of automatic evaluation, we propose the AEOLLM task which focuses on generative tasks and encourages reference-free methods. Besides, we set up diverse subtasks such as dialogue generation, text expansion, summary generation and non-factoid question answering to comprehensively test different methods. This year, we received 48 runs from 4 teams in total. This paper will describe the background of the task, the data set, the evaluation measures and the evaluation results, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[TuBA: Cross-Lingual Transferability of Backdoor Attacks in LLMs with Instruction Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19597v3)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The implications of backdoor attacks on English-centric large language models (LLMs) have been widely examined - such attacks can be achieved by embedding malicious behaviors during training and activated under specific conditions that trigger malicious outputs. Despite the increasing support for multilingual capabilities in open-source and proprietary LLMs, the impact of backdoor attacks on these systems remains largely under-explored. Our research focuses on cross-lingual backdoor attacks against multilingual LLMs, particularly investigating how poisoning the instruction-tuning data for one or two languages can affect the outputs for languages whose instruction-tuning data were not poisoned. Despite its simplicity, our empirical analysis reveals that our method exhibits remarkable efficacy in models like mT5 and GPT-4o, with high attack success rates, surpassing 90% in more than 7 out of 12 languages across various scenarios. Our findings also indicate that more powerful models show increased susceptibility to transferable cross-lingual backdoor attacks, which also applies to LLMs predominantly pre-trained on English data, such as Llama2, Llama3, and Gemma. Moreover, our experiments demonstrate 1) High Transferability: the backdoor mechanism operates successfully in cross-lingual response scenarios across 26 languages, achieving an average attack success rate of 99%, and 2) Robustness: the proposed attack remains effective even after defenses are applied. These findings expose critical security vulnerabilities in multilingual LLMs and highlight the urgent need for more robust, targeted defense strategies to address the unique challenges posed by cross-lingual backdoor transfer.</p></details> | work in progress |

QLoRA has emerged as the standard approach for on-device LLMs, leveraging quantized models to reduce memory and computational costs while utilizing LoRA for task-specific adaptability. In this work, we propose ROMA, a QLoRA accelerator with a hybrid storage architecture that uses ROM for quantized base models and SRAM for LoRA weights and KV cache. Our insight is that the quantized base model is stable and converged, making it well-suited for ROM storage. Meanwhile, LoRA modules offer the flexibility to adapt to new data without requiring updates to the base model. To further reduce the area cost of ROM, we introduce a novel B-ROM design and integrate it with the compute unit to form a fused cell for efficient use of chip resources. ROMA can effectively store both a 4-bit 3B and a 2-bit 8B LLaMA model entirely on-chip, achieving a notable generation speed exceeding 20,000 tokens/s without requiring external memory.</p></details> |  |
| **[Aligning Vision to Language: Text-Free Multimodal Knowledge Graph Construction for Enhanced LLMs Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12972v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) struggles with incomplete knowledge and hallucination artifacts, challenges that textual Knowledge Graphs (KGs) only partially mitigate due to their modality isolation. While Multimodal Knowledge Graphs (MMKGs) promise enhanced cross-modal understanding, their practical construction is impeded by semantic narrowness of manual text annotations and inherent noise in visual-semantic entity linkages. In this paper, we propose Vision-align-to-Language integrated Knowledge Graph (VaLiK), a novel approach for constructing MMKGs that enhances LLMs reasoning through cross-modal information supplementation. Specifically, we cascade pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to align image features with text, transforming them into descriptions that encapsulate image-specific information. Furthermore, we developed a cross-modal similarity verification mechanism to quantify semantic consistency, effectively filtering out noise introduced during feature alignment. Even without manually annotated image captions, the refined descriptions alone suffice to construct the MMKG. Compared to conventional MMKGs construction paradigms, our approach achieves substantial storage efficiency gains while maintaining direct entity-to-image linkage capability. Experimental results on multimodal reasoning tasks demonstrate that LLMs augmented with VaLiK outperform previous state-of-the-art models.

The success of these models can largely be attributed to the dominant scaling law, which states that larger parameter sizes and data volumes contribute to better performance. Notably, data scaling has mainly been powered by automatic data pipelines, which center around the self-instruction of LLMs. The paradigm has been taken for granted for quite some time, but the study of the effectiveness of scaling with these data has been neglected for a long time. In this context, this work revisits scaling with synthetic data and focuses on developing video-LLMs from a data-centric perspective. Our main study approach is fine-tuning pre-trained image-LLMs with video data and investigating learning efficiency through data scaling. Results from our preliminary experiments reveal a low learning efficiency phenomenon when simply scaling up video data samples, which, through our probing, can be ascribed to a lack of instruction diversity. Aiming at this issue, we propose a data augmentation method called Sparrow, which synthesizes video-like samples from pure text instruction data. Mixing these synthetic samples with the video data enables a more efficient training scheme. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed method achieves performance comparable to or even superior to baselines trained with many more samples. Meanwhile, we find that incorporating these synthetic samples can boost the performance of long video understanding without training with long video data.

However, existing research lacks a systematic understanding of the mechanisms underlying how thinking patterns affect performance across model sizes. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the impact of various thinking types on model performance and introduce ThinkPatterns-21k, a curated dataset comprising 21k instruction-response pairs (QA) collected from existing instruction-following datasets with five thinking types. For each pair, we augment it with five distinct internal thinking patterns: one unstructured thinking (monologue) and four structured variants (decomposition, self-ask, self-debate and self-critic), while maintaining the same instruction and response. Through extensive evaluation across different model sizes (3B-32B parameters), we have two key findings: (1) smaller models (<30B parameters) can benefit from most of structured thinking patterns, while larger models (32B) with structured thinking like decomposition would degrade performance and (2) unstructured monologue demonstrates broad effectiveness across different model sizes. Finally, we released all of our datasets, checkpoints, training logs of diverse thinking patterns to reproducibility, aiming to facilitate further research in this direction.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Semantic-based Optimization Approach for Repairing LLMs: Case Study on Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12899v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language Models (LMs) are widely used in software engineering for code generation, but they may produce code with errors. Rather than repairing the generated code, an alternative way is to address the underlying failures of models. LM repair offers a lightweight solution to this challenge: it requires minimal data, reduces computational costs, and reduces the side effects. Unlike retraining, LM repair focuses on applying tailored updates to targeted neurons, making it ideal for scenarios with limited resources, high-performance demands, or strict safety requirements. In this paper, we propose \ul{S}emantic \ul{T}argeting for \ul{A}nalytical \ul{R}epair (\textsc{STAR}), a pioneering and novel semantic-based optimization approach for repairing LLMs. \textsc{STAR} realizes main operations in LM repair methods in an optimization process, including locating ``buggy neurons'', solving ``neuron patches'', and patching ``buggy neurons''. Correspondingly, it computes the deltas of weight matrix as the prior information to guide optimization; and attributes the targeted layers and neurons leveraging statistical insights. The neuron patches are computed with a solid semantic-based analytical formula, which directly bridges the changes to logits with the deltas of neurons, by steering latent representations. Compared to the prior work of LM repair (\textsc{MINT}) and optimization methods (\textsc{SGD}), \textsc{STAR} integrates their strengths while mitigating their limitations. \textsc{STAR} supports solving multiple failures together, significantly improving the usefulness. Evaluated on three code generation tasks using popular code LMs, \textsc{STAR} demonstrates superior effectiveness. Additionally, \textsc{STAR} exhibits better efficiency. In terms of side effects, namely the balance between generalization and specificity, \textsc{STAR} outperforms prior work by a significant margin.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 6 figure, 6 tables, under peer-review</p></details> |

Jogging the Memory of Unlearned LLMs via Benign Relearning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13356v4)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine unlearning is a promising approach to mitigate undesirable memorization of training data in ML models. However, in this work we show that existing approaches for unlearning in LLMs are surprisingly susceptible to a simple set of $\textit{benign relearning attacks}$. With access to only a small and potentially loosely related set of data, we find that we can ''jog'' the memory of unlearned models to reverse the effects of unlearning. For example, we show that relearning on public medical articles can lead an unlearned LLM to output harmful knowledge about bioweapons, and relearning general wiki information about the book series Harry Potter can force the model to output verbatim memorized text. We formalize this unlearning-relearning pipeline, explore the attack across three popular unlearning benchmarks, and discuss future directions and guidelines that result from our study. Our work indicates that current approximate unlearning methods simply suppress the model outputs and fail to robustly forget target knowledge in the LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025, 32 pages, 8 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |

A representative line of study is locate-then-edit methods, which typically employ causal tracing to identify the modules responsible for recalling factual knowledge about entities. However, we find these methods are often sensitive only to changes in the subject entity, leaving them less effective at adapting to changes in relations. This limitation results in poor editing locality, which can lead to the persistence of irrelevant or inaccurate facts, ultimately compromising the reliability of LLMs. We believe this issue arises from the insufficient precision of knowledge localization. To address this, we propose a Fine-grained Neuron-level Knowledge Editing (FiNE) method that enhances editing locality without affecting overall success rates. By precisely identifying and modifying specific neurons within feed-forward networks, FiNE significantly improves knowledge localization and editing. Quantitative experiments demonstrate that FiNE efficiently achieves better overall performance compared to existing techniques, providing new insights into the localization and modification of knowledge within LLMs.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

However, the substantial computational costs associated with RL-based approaches have led to growing interest in alternative paradigms, such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of DPO in facilitating self-improvement for LLMs through iterative preference-based learning. We demonstrate that a single round of DPO with coarse filtering significantly enhances mathematical reasoning performance, particularly for strong base model. Furthermore, we design an iterative enhancement framework for both the generator and the reward model (RM), enabling their mutual improvement through online interaction across multiple rounds of DPO. Finally, with simple verifiable rewards, our model DPO-VP achieves RL-level performance with significantly lower computational overhead. These findings highlight DPO as a scalable and cost-effective alternative to RL, offering a practical solution for enhancing LLM reasoning in resource-constrained situations.</p></details> |  |
| **[ToolFlow: Boosting LLM Tool-Calling Through Natural and Coherent Dialogue Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18447v2)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is a common method to enhance the tool calling capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), with the training data often being synthesized. The current data synthesis process generally involves sampling a set of tools, formulating a requirement based on these tools, and generating the call statements. However, tools sampled randomly lack relevance, making them difficult to combine and thus reducing the diversity of the data. Additionally, current work overlooks the coherence between turns of dialogues, leading to a gap between the synthesized data and real-world scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a Graph-based Sampling strategy to sample more relevant tool combinations, and a Planned-generation strategy to create plans that guide the synthesis of coherent dialogues. We integrate these two strategies and enable multiple agents to synthesize the dialogue data interactively, resulting in our tool-calling data synthesis pipeline ToolFlow. Data quality assessments demonstrate improvements in the naturalness and coherence of our synthesized dialogues. Finally, we apply SFT on LLaMA-3.1-8B using 8,000 synthetic dialogues generated with ToolFlow. Results show that the model achieves tool-calling performance comparable to or even surpassing GPT-4, while maintaining strong general capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NAACL 2025</p></details> |
| **[Policy Prototyping for LLMs: Pluralistic Alignment via Interactive and Collaborative Policymaking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08622v2)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Emerging efforts in AI alignment seek to broaden participation in shaping model behavior by eliciting and integrating collective input into a policy for model finetuning. While pluralistic, these processes are often linear and do not allow participating stakeholders to confirm whether potential outcomes of their contributions are indeed consistent with their intentions. Design prototyping has long advocated for rapid iteration using tight feedback loops of ideation, experimentation, and evaluation to mitigate these issues. We thus propose policy prototyping for LLMs, a new process that draws inspiration from prototyping practices to enable stakeholders to collaboratively and interactively draft LLM policies. Through learnings from a real-world LLM policymaking initiative at an industrial AI lab, we motivate our approach and characterize policy prototyping with four guiding principles. Because policy prototyping emphasizes a contrasting set of priorities compared to previous approaches, we envision our approach to be a valuable addition to the methodological repertoire for collaborative, pluralistic alignment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Bidir...</summary><p>Bidirectional Human-AI Alignment (Bi-Align) Workshop @ ICLR 2025</p></details> |

Drawing on conflict resolution theory, we introduce a user-centered workflow for multi-user personalization comprising three stages: Reflection, Analysis, and Feedback. We then present MAP -- a \textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{A}gent system for multi-user \textbf{P}ersonalization -- to operationalize this workflow. By delegating subtasks to specialized agents, MAP (1) retrieves and reflects on relevant user information, while enhancing reliability through agent-to-agent interactions, (2) provides detailed analysis for improved transparency and usability, and (3) integrates user feedback to iteratively refine results. Our user study findings (n=12) highlight MAP's effectiveness and usability for conflict resolution while emphasizing the importance of user involvement in resolution verification and failure management. This work highlights the potential of multi-agent systems to implement user-centered, multi-user personalization workflows and concludes by offering insights for personalization in multi-user contexts.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Ex...</summary><p>In Extended Abstracts of the CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI EA '25), April 26-May 1, 2025, Yokohama, Japan</p></details> |

To that end, we systematically investigate whether LLMs can reason about programs using a program analysis framework called abstract interpretation. We prompt LLMs to follow two different strategies, denoted as Compositional and Fixed Point Equation, to formally reason in the style of abstract interpretation, which has never been done before to the best of our knowledge. We validate our approach using state-of-the-art LLMs on 22 challenging benchmark programs from the Software Verification Competition (SV-COMP) 2019 dataset, widely used in program analysis. Our results show that our strategies are able to elicit abstract interpretation-based reasoning in the tested models, but LLMs are susceptible to logical errors, especially while interpreting complex program structures, as well as general hallucinations. This highlights key areas for improvement in the formal reasoning capabilities of LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[When "Competency" in Reasoning Opens the Door to Vulnerability: Jailbreaking LLMs via Novel Complex Ciphers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10601v3)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Large Language Model (LLM) safety have primarily focused on mitigating attacks crafted in natural language or common ciphers (e.g. Base64), which are likely integrated into newer models' safety training. However, we reveal a paradoxical vulnerability: as LLMs advance in reasoning, they inadvertently become more susceptible to novel jailbreaking attacks. Enhanced reasoning enables LLMs to interpret complex instructions and decode complex user-defined ciphers, creating an exploitable security gap. To study this vulnerability, we introduce Attacks using Custom Encryptions (ACE), a jailbreaking technique that encodes malicious queries with novel ciphers. Extending ACE, we introduce Layered Attacks using Custom Encryptions (LACE), which applies multi-layer ciphers to amplify attack complexity. Furthermore, we develop CipherBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' accuracy in decoding encrypted benign text. Our experiments reveal a critical trade-off: LLMs that are more capable of decoding ciphers are more vulnerable to these jailbreaking attacks, with success rates on GPT-4o escalating from 40% under ACE to 78% with LACE. These findings highlight a critical insight: as LLMs become more adept at deciphering complex user ciphers--many of which cannot be preemptively included in safety training--they become increasingly exploitable.</p></details> |  |
| **[VeriLA: A Human-Centered Evaluation Framework for Interpretable Verification of LLM Agent Failures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12651v1)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI practitioners increasingly use large language model (LLM) agents in compound AI systems to solve complex reasoning tasks, these agent executions often fail to meet human standards, leading to errors that compromise the system's overall performance. Addressing these failures through human intervention is challenging due to the agents' opaque reasoning processes, misalignment with human expectations, the complexity of agent dependencies, and the high cost of manual inspection. This paper thus introduces a human-centered evaluation framework for Verifying LLM Agent failures (VeriLA), which systematically assesses agent failures to reduce human effort and make these agent failures interpretable to humans. The framework first defines clear expectations of each agent by curating human-designed agent criteria. Then, it develops a human-aligned agent verifier module, trained with human gold standards, to assess each agent's execution output. This approach enables granular evaluation of each agent's performance by revealing failures from a human standard, offering clear guidelines for revision, and reducing human cognitive load. Our case study results show that VeriLA is both interpretable and efficient in helping practitioners interact more effectively with the system. By upholding accountability in human-agent collaboration, VeriLA paves the way for more trustworthy and human-aligned compound AI systems.</p></details> |  |

The article extends the US presidential election analysis made in previous works, where multiple LLMs were asked to vote between Joe Biden and Donald Trump in a virtual election, and the results showed a clear lean of LLMs toward Joe Biden. This article considers natural follow-up questions that could arise from that experiment, such as: what is the extent of this phenomenon? Is it generalizable to multiple virtual elections in other countries? The article considers virtual elections in ten european countries: Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Poland, Romania, Netherlands, Belgium, Czech Republic, and Sweden, and with four different LLMs: gpt4o, claude 3.5 sonnet, mistral-large, and gemini-2.0-flash.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-Mediated Guidance of MARL Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13553v1)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In complex multi-agent environments, achieving efficient learning and desirable behaviours is a significant challenge for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) systems. This work explores the potential of combining MARL with Large Language Model (LLM)-mediated interventions to guide agents toward more desirable behaviours. Specifically, we investigate how LLMs can be used to interpret and facilitate interventions that shape the learning trajectories of multiple agents. We experimented with two types of interventions, referred to as controllers: a Natural Language (NL) Controller and a Rule-Based (RB) Controller. The NL Controller, which uses an LLM to simulate human-like interventions, showed a stronger impact than the RB Controller. Our findings indicate that agents particularly benefit from early interventions, leading to more efficient training and higher performance. Both intervention types outperform the baseline without interventions, highlighting the potential of LLM-mediated guidance to accelerate training and enhance MARL performance in challenging environments.</p></details> | 31 pages, 50 figures |
| **[GraphEval: A Lightweight Graph-Based LLM Framework for Idea Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12600v1)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The powerful capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to their growing use in evaluating human-generated content, particularly in evaluating research ideas within academic settings. Existing solutions primarily rely on prompt-based LLM methods or fine-tuned lightweight language models for idea evaluation. However, these methods are often unstable and struggle to comprehend the complex semantic information embedded in the ideas, impeding their ability to perform high-quality evaluations. To address the above challenges, we propose GraphEval, a lightweight graph-based LLM framework for idea evaluation. Our insight is that a complex idea can be broken down into comprehensible viewpoint nodes using prompts from small LLMs. These viewpoint nodes can then be linked together through edges created from LLM-based relation extraction and/or BERT similarity scores. The created viewpoint-graph can be used to conveniently propagate scores across view-nodes to improve the robustness of the idea evaluations. In particular, we propose two lightweight graph-based methods for idea evaluation: (1) GraphEval-LP: a training-free label propagation algorithm that propagates evaluation scores from known view-nodes to unknown nodes; (2) GraphEval-GNN: a Graph Neural Networks (GNN) that is trained to predict the evaluation scores given the observed graph with minimal computation resources. Moreover, to overcome LLM's limitation in objectively assessing the novelty of ideas, we further propose a novelty detection model to GraphEval-GNN to enhance its capability in judging idea novelty. Experiments on two datasets show GraphEval improves F1 scores by at least 14% with low computation and API costs. Additionally, GraphEval can effectively detect plagiarized ideas.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces MoECollab, a novel framework leveraging Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture to enable distributed, collaborative LLM development. By decomposing monolithic models into specialized expert modules coordinated by a trainable gating network, our framework allows diverse contributors to participate regardless of computational resources. We provide a complete technical implementation with mathematical foundations for expert dynamics, gating mechanisms, and integration strategies. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves accuracy improvements of 3-7% over baseline models while reducing computational requirements by 34%. Expert specialization yields significant domain-specific gains, with improvements from 51% to 88% F1 score in general classification and from 23% to 44% accuracy in news categorization. We formalize the routing entropy optimization problem and demonstrate how proper regularization techniques lead to 14% higher expert utilization rates. These results validate MoECollab as an effective approach for democratizing LLM development through architecturally-supported collaboration.</p></details> |  |

However, this poses risk of privacy and copyright violations, highlighting the need for efficient machine unlearning methods that remove sensitive data without retraining from scratch. While Gradient Ascent (GA) is commonly used to unlearn by reducing the likelihood of generating unwanted content, it leads to unstable optimization and catastrophic forgetting of retrained knowledge. We find that combining GA with low-rank adaptation results in poor trade-offs between computational cost and generative performance. To address these challenges, we propose two novel techniques for robust and efficient unlearning for LLMs. First, we introduce Inverted Hinge Loss, which suppresses unwanted tokens while maintaining fluency by boosting the probability of the next most likely token. Second, we develop a data-adaptive initialization for LoRA adapters via low-rank approximation weighted with relative Fisher information, thereby focusing updates on parameters critical for removing targeted knowledge. Experiments on the Training Data Extraction Challenge dataset using GPT-Neo models as well as on the TOFU benchmark with Phi-1.5B and Llama2-7B models demonstrate that our approach effectively removes sensitive information while maintaining reasoning and generative capabilities with minimal impact. Our implementation can be found in https://github.com/csm9493/efficient-llm-unlearning.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025 camera-ready version</p></details> |

However, the open-loop nature of previous works makes LLM-based planning error-prone and fragile. On the other hand, failure detection approaches for closed-loop planning are often limited by task-specific heuristics or following an unrealistic assumption that the prediction is trustworthy all the time. As a general-purpose reasoning machine, LLMs or Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are promising for detecting failures. However, However, the appropriateness of the aforementioned assumption diminishes due to the notorious hullucination problem. In this work, we attempt to mitigate these issues by introducing a framework for closed-loop LLM-based planning called KnowLoop, backed by an uncertainty-based MLLMs failure detector, which is agnostic to any used MLLMs or LLMs. Specifically, we evaluate three different ways for quantifying the uncertainty of MLLMs, namely token probability, entropy, and self-explained confidence as primary metrics based on three carefully designed representative prompting strategies. With a self-collected dataset including various manipulation tasks and an LLM-based robot system, our experiments demonstrate that token probability and entropy are more reflective compared to self-explained confidence. By setting an appropriate threshold to filter out uncertain predictions and seek human help actively, the accuracy of failure detection can be significantly enhanced. This improvement boosts the effectiveness of closed-loop planning and the overall success rate of tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICRA 2024 Workshop on Back to the Future: Robot Learning Going Probabilistic.

However, popular sampling methods like top-p (nucleus sampling) often struggle to balance quality and diversity, especially at higher temperatures, leading to incoherent or repetitive outputs. To address this challenge, we propose min-p sampling, a dynamic truncation method that adjusts the sampling threshold based on the model's confidence by scaling according to the top token's probability. We conduct extensive experiments on benchmarks including GPQA, GSM8K, and AlpacaEval Creative Writing, demonstrating that min-p sampling improves both the quality and diversity of generated text, particularly at high temperatures. Moreover, human evaluations reveal a clear preference for min-p sampling in terms of both text quality and diversity. Min-p sampling has been adopted by multiple open-source LLM implementations, highlighting its practical utility and potential impact.</p></details> | <details><summary>Impro...</summary><p>Improvements: 1.

This study introduces the persona knowledge gap, the discrepancy between a model's internal understanding and the knowledge required for coherent, personalized conversations. While prior research has recognized these gaps, computational methods for their identification and resolution remain underexplored. We propose Conversation Preference Elicitation and Recommendation (CPER), a novel framework that dynamically detects and resolves persona knowledge gaps using intrinsic uncertainty quantification and feedback-driven refinement. CPER consists of three key modules: a Contextual Understanding Module for preference extraction, a Dynamic Feedback Module for measuring uncertainty and refining persona alignment, and a Persona-Driven Response Generation module for adapting responses based on accumulated user context. We evaluate CPER on two real-world datasets: CCPE-M for preferential movie recommendations and ESConv for mental health support. Using A/B testing, human evaluators preferred CPER's responses 42% more often than baseline models in CCPE-M and 27% more often in ESConv. A qualitative human evaluation confirms that CPER's responses are preferred for maintaining contextual relevance and coherence, particularly in longer (12+ turn) conversations.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 1 Figure, Oral Presentation at NAACL 2025</p></details> |

Despite their widespread adoption, SRS often grapple with the long-tail user dilemma, resulting in less effective recommendations for individuals with limited interaction records. The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), with their profound capability to discern semantic relationships among items, has opened new avenues for enhancing SRS through data augmentation. Nonetheless, current methodologies encounter obstacles, including the absence of collaborative signals and the prevalence of hallucination phenomena.In this work, we present LLMSeR, an innovative framework that utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate pseudo-prior items, thereby improving the efficacy of Sequential Recommender Systems (SRS). To alleviate the challenge of insufficient collaborative signals, we introduce the Semantic Interaction Augmentor (SIA), a method that integrates both semantic and collaborative information to comprehensively augment user interaction data. Moreover, to weaken the adverse effects of hallucination in SRS, we develop the Adaptive Reliability Validation (ARV), a validation technique designed to assess the reliability of the generated pseudo items. Complementing these advancements, we also devise a Dual-Channel Training strategy, ensuring seamless integration of data augmentation into the SRS training process.Extensive experiments conducted with three widely-used SRS models demonstrate the generalizability and efficacy of LLMSeR.</p></details> |  |

The Cantonese language used in Hong Kong presents unique challenges for natural language processing due to its rich cultural nuances and lack of dedicated evaluation datasets. The HKCanto-Eval benchmark addresses this gap by evaluating the performance of large language models (LLMs) on Cantonese language understanding tasks, extending to English and Written Chinese for cross-lingual evaluation. HKCanto-Eval integrates cultural and linguistic nuances intrinsic to Hong Kong, providing a robust framework for assessing language models in realistic scenarios. Additionally, the benchmark includes questions designed to tap into the underlying linguistic metaknowledge of the models. Our findings indicate that while proprietary models generally outperform open-weight models, significant limitations remain in handling Cantonese-specific linguistic and cultural knowledge, highlighting the need for more targeted training data and evaluation methods.

However, most existing evaluation practices are not designed for LLM-generated topics and result in low inter-annotator agreement scores, hindering the reliable use of LLMs for the task. To address this, we introduce $T^5Score$, an evaluation methodology that decomposes the quality of a topic set into quantifiable aspects, measurable through easy-to-perform annotation tasks. This framing enables a convenient, manual or automatic, evaluation procedure resulting in a strong inter-annotator agreement score. To substantiate our methodology and claims, we perform extensive experimentation on multiple datasets and report the results.</p></details> |  |

However, in the factory automation sector, particularly motion control, manual programming, alongside inefficient and unsafe debugging practices, remains prevalent. This stems from the complex interplay of mechanical and electrical systems and stringent safety requirements. Moreover, most current AI-assisted motion control programming efforts focus on PLCs, with little attention given to high-level languages and function libraries. To address these challenges, we introduce MCCoder, an LLM-powered system tailored for generating motion control code, integrated with a soft-motion controller. MCCoder improves code generation through a structured workflow that combines multitask decomposition, hybrid retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and iterative self-correction, utilizing a well-established motion library. Additionally, it integrates a 3D simulator for intuitive motion validation and logs of full motion trajectories for data verification, significantly enhancing accuracy and safety. In the absence of benchmark datasets and metrics tailored for evaluating motion control code generation, we propose MCEVAL, a dataset spanning motion tasks of varying complexity. Experiments show that MCCoder outperforms baseline models using Advanced RAG, achieving an overall performance gain of 33.09% and a 131.77% improvement on complex tasks in the MCEVAL dataset.</p></details> |  |

Differentially private (DP) finetuning of large language models (LLMs) as data generator is effective, but is impractical when computation resources are limited. Meanwhile, prompt-based methods such as private evolution, depend heavily on the manual prompts, and ineffectively use private information in their iterative data selection process. To overcome these limitations, we propose CTCL (Data Synthesis with ConTrollability and CLustering), a novel framework for generating privacy-preserving synthetic data without extensive prompt engineering or billion-scale LLM finetuning. CTCL pretrains a lightweight 140M conditional generator and a clustering-based topic model on large-scale public data. To further adapt to the private domain, the generator is DP finetuned on private data for fine-grained textual information, while the topic model extracts a DP histogram representing distributional information. The DP generator then samples according to the DP histogram to synthesize a desired number of data examples. Evaluation across five diverse domains demonstrates the effectiveness of our framework, particularly in the strong privacy regime. Systematic ablation validates the design of each framework component and highlights the scalability of our approach.</p></details> |  |

To address these challenges, we propose an LLM-Generated EXplainable PRopErty valuation SyStem with neighbor imputation called EXPRESS, which provides the customizable missing value imputation technique, and addresses the opaqueness of prediction by providing the feature-wise explanation generated by LLM. The dynamic nearest neighbor search finds similar properties depending on different application scenarios by property configuration set by users (e.g., house age as criteria for the house in rural areas, and locations for buildings in urban areas). Motivated by the human appraisal procedure, we generate feature-wise explanations to provide users with a more intuitive understanding of the prediction results.</p></details> | Preprint |

Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is a promising LLM compression technique. However, existing SVD-based compression methods fall short in reducing truncation losses, leading to less competitive performance in compressed models. In this work, we introduce SVD-LLM V2, a SVD-based LLM compression method that optimizes singular value truncation in SVD compression with two techniques. First, SVD-LLM V2 proposes to use theoretical truncation loss of weight matrices to assign a unique compression ratio to each weight matrix at different layers to accommodate weight redundancy heterogeneity. Second, SVD-LLM V2 proposes loss-optimized weight truncation to ensure that the truncated singular values result in a lower and more stable truncation loss in practice. We evaluate SVD-LLM V2 on ten datasets and five LLMs at various scales. Our results show SVD-LLM V2 outperforms state-of-the-art SVD-based LLM compression methods.

In PTSD Therapy Mode, an implanted closed-loop neural device monitors amygdala activity and provides on-demand stimulation upon detecting pathological theta oscillations, while an ensemble of wearables (smart glasses, smartwatches, smartphones) uses multimodal large language model (LLM) analysis of sensory data to detect environmental or physiological PTSD triggers and deliver timely audiovisual interventions. Logged events from both the neural and wearable loops are analyzed to personalize trigger detection and progressively transition patients to non-invasive interventions. In Neuroscience Research Mode, the same platform is adapted for real-world brain activity capture. Wearable-LLM systems recognize naturalistic events (social interactions, emotional situations, compulsive behaviors, decision making) and signal implanted RNS devices (via wireless triggers) to record synchronized intracranial data during these moments. This approach builds on recent advances in mobile intracranial EEG recording and closed-loop neuromodulation in humans (BRAIN Initiative, 2023) (Mobbs et al., 2021). We discuss how our interdisciplinary system could revolutionize PTSD therapy and cognitive neuroscience by enabling 24/7 monitoring, context-aware intervention, and rich data collection outside traditional labs. The vision is a future where AI-enhanced devices continuously collaborate with the human brain, offering therapeutic support and deep insights into neural function, with the resulting real-world context rich neural data, in turn, accelerating the development of more biologically-grounded and human-centric AI.</p></details> |  |

With the rise of LLMs, modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs) generate detailed and comprehensive image descriptions. However, benchmarking the quality of such captions remains unresolved. This paper addresses two key questions: (1) How well do current VLMs actually perform on image captioning, particularly compared to humans? We built CapArena, a platform with over 6000 pairwise caption battles and high-quality human preference votes. Our arena-style evaluation marks a milestone, showing that leading models like GPT-4o achieve or even surpass human performance, while most open-source models lag behind. (2) Can automated metrics reliably assess detailed caption quality? Using human annotations from CapArena, we evaluate traditional and recent captioning metrics, as well as VLM-as-a-Judge. Our analysis reveals that while some metrics (e.g., METEOR) show decent caption-level agreement with humans, their systematic biases lead to inconsistencies in model ranking. In contrast, VLM-as-a-Judge demonstrates robust discernment at both the caption and model levels. Building on these insights, we release CapArena-Auto, an accurate and efficient automated benchmark for detailed captioning, achieving 94.3% correlation with human rankings at just $4 per test. Data and resources will be open-sourced at https://caparena.github.io.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging Vision Capabilities of Multimodal LLMs for Automated Data Extraction from Plots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12326v1)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated data extraction from research texts has been steadily improving, with the emergence of large language models (LLMs) accelerating progress even further. Extracting data from plots in research papers, however, has been such a complex task that it has predominantly been confined to manual data extraction. We show that current multimodal large language models, with proper instructions and engineered workflows, are capable of accurately extracting data from plots. This capability is inherent to the pretrained models and can be achieved with a chain-of-thought sequence of zero-shot engineered prompts we call PlotExtract, without the need to fine-tune. We demonstrate PlotExtract here and assess its performance on synthetic and published plots. We consider only plots with two axes in this analysis. For plots identified as extractable, PlotExtract finds points with over 90% precision (and around 90% recall) and errors in x and y position of around 5% or lower. These results prove that multimodal LLMs are a viable path for high-throughput data extraction for plots and in many circumstances can replace the current manual methods of data extraction.</p></details> | 8 pages, 3 figures |

We attribute this to subjective evaluation criteria combined with Likert scale scoring in existing protocols. To address this issue, we introduce CheckEval, a checklist-based evaluation framework that improves rating reliability via decomposed binary questions. Through experiments with 12 evaluator models across multiple datasets, we first demonstrate that CheckEval strongly correlates with human judgments, improving the average correlation with human judgments by 0.10. More importantly, CheckEval dramatically improves the average agreement across evaluator models by 0.45 and reduces the score variance. CheckEval scores furthermore have the benefit of being more interpretable because it decomposes evaluation criteria into traceable binary decisions, allowing analyses of specific attributes driving quality judgments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended version currently under review (Workshop version: HEAL at CHI 2024)</p></details> |
| **[Mark Your LLM: Detecting the Misuse of Open-Source Large Language Models via Watermarking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04636v2)** | 2025-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As open-source large language models (LLMs) like Llama3 become more capable, it is crucial to develop watermarking techniques to detect their potential misuse. Existing watermarking methods either add watermarks during LLM inference, which is unsuitable for open-source LLMs, or primarily target classification LLMs rather than recent generative LLMs. Adapting these watermarks to open-source LLMs for misuse detection remains an open challenge. This work defines two misuse scenarios for open-source LLMs: intellectual property (IP) violation and LLM Usage Violation. Then, we explore the application of inference-time watermark distillation and backdoor watermarking in these contexts. We propose comprehensive evaluation methods to assess the impact of various real-world further fine-tuning scenarios on watermarks and the effect of these watermarks on LLM performance. Our experiments reveal that backdoor watermarking could effectively detect IP Violation, while inference-time watermark distillation is applicable in both scenarios but less robust to further fine-tuning and has a more significant impact on LLM performance compared to backdoor watermarking. Exploring more advanced watermarking methods for open-source LLMs to detect their misuse should be an important future direction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the ICLR 2025 Workshop on GenAI Watermarking</p></details> |
| **[Taming Sensitive Weights : Noise Perturbation Fine-tuning for Robust LLM Quantization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06858v2)** | 2025-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantization is a critical step to enable efficient LLM serving under limited resource. However, previous research observes that certain weights in the LLM, known as outliers, are significantly sensitive to quantization noises. Existing quantization methods leave these outliers as floating points or higher precisions to retain performance, posting challenges on the efficient hardware deployment of the mixed-precision model. This work investigates an alternative way to tame the sensitive weights' impact on the quantization error, by reducing the loss Hessian trace with respect to outliers through an efficient fine-tuning process. We propose Noise Perturbation Fine-tuning (NPFT), which identifies outlier weights and add random weight perturbations on the outliers as the model going through a PEFT optimization. NPFT tames the sensitivity of outlier weights so that the quantized model performance can be improved without special treatment to the outliers. When applied to OPT and LLaMA models, our NPFT method achieves stable performance improvements for both uniform and non-uniform quantizers, while also offering better inference efficiency. Notably, the simplest RTN can achieve performance on par with GPTQ using our NPFT on LLaMA2-7B-4bits benchmark.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as poster by CPAL2025</p></details> |

Despite its potential in privacy preserving machine learning, secure multi party computation, private blockchain transactions, and secure medical diagnostics, its adoption remains limited due to cryptographic complexity and usability challenges. While various TFHE libraries and compilers exist, practical code generation remains a hurdle. We propose a compiler integrated framework to evaluate LLM inference and agentic optimization for TFHE code generation, focusing on logic gates and ReLU activation. Our methodology assesses error rates, compilability, and structural similarity across open and closedsource LLMs. Results highlight significant limitations in off-the-shelf models, while agentic optimizations such as retrieval augmented generation (RAG) and few-shot prompting reduce errors and enhance code fidelity. This work establishes the first benchmark for TFHE code generation, demonstrating how LLMs, when augmented with domain-specific feedback, can bridge the expertise gap in FHE code generation.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |

| **[Towards Practical Real-Time Neural Video Compression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20762v2)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a practical real-time neural video codec (NVC) designed to deliver high compression ratio, low latency and broad versatility. In practice, the coding speed of NVCs depends on 1) computational costs, and 2) non-computational operational costs, such as memory I/O and the number of function calls. While most efficient NVCs prioritize reducing computational cost, we identify operational cost as the primary bottleneck to achieving higher coding speed. Leveraging this insight, we introduce a set of efficiency-driven design improvements focused on minimizing operational costs. Specifically, we employ implicit temporal modeling to eliminate complex explicit motion modules, and use single low-resolution latent representations rather than progressive downsampling. These innovations significantly accelerate NVC without sacrificing compression quality. Additionally, we implement model integerization for consistent cross-device coding and a module-bank-based rate control scheme to improve practical adaptability. Experiments show our proposed DCVC-RT achieves an impressive average encoding/decoding speed at 125.2/112.8 fps (frames per second) for 1080p video, while saving an average of 21% in bitrate compared to H.266/VTM.

TAPS can effectively obtain surrogate models for high-dimensional parametric problems with equivalent zetta-scale ($10^{21}$) degrees of freedom (DoFs). TAPS achieves this by directly obtaining reduced-order models through solving governing equations with multiple independent variables such as spatial coordinates, parameters, and time. The paper first introduces an AI-enhanced finite element-type interpolation function called convolution hierarchical deep-learning neural network (C-HiDeNN) with tensor decomposition (TD). Subsequently, the generalized space-parameter-time Galerkin weak form and the corresponding matrix form are derived. Through the choice of TAPS hyperparameters, an arbitrary convergence rate can be achieved. To show the capabilities of this framework, TAPS is then used to simulate a large-scale additive manufacturing process as an example and achieves around 1,370x speedup, 14.8x memory savings, and 955x storage gain compared to the finite difference method with $3.46$ billion spatial degrees of freedom (DoFs). As a result, the TAPS framework opens a new avenue for many challenging ultra large-scale engineering problems, such as additive manufacturing and integrated circuit design, among others.</p></details> |  |
| **[Benchmarking LLMs and LLM-based Agents in Practical Vulnerability Detection for Code Repositories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03586v2)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in software vulnerability detection, particularly on function-level benchmarks like Devign and BigVul. However, real-world detection requires interprocedural analysis, as vulnerabilities often emerge through multi-hop function calls rather than isolated functions. While repository-level benchmarks like ReposVul and VulEval introduce interprocedural context, they remain computationally expensive, lack pairwise evaluation of vulnerability fixes, and explore limited context retrieval, limiting their practicality. We introduce JitVul, a JIT vulnerability detection benchmark linking each function to its vulnerability-introducing and fixing commits. Built from 879 CVEs spanning 91 vulnerability types, JitVul enables comprehensive evaluation of detection capabilities. Our results show that ReAct Agents, leveraging thought-action-observation and interprocedural context, perform better than LLMs in distinguishing vulnerable from benign code. While prompting strategies like Chain-of-Thought help LLMs, ReAct Agents require further refinement. Both methods show inconsistencies, either misidentifying vulnerabilities or over-analyzing security guards, indicating significant room for improvement.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cauchy-Schwarz Regularizers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01639v3)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a novel class of regularization functions, called Cauchy-Schwarz (CS) regularizers, which can be designed to induce a wide range of properties in solution vectors of optimization problems. To demonstrate the versatility of CS regularizers, we derive regularization functions that promote discrete-valued vectors, eigenvectors of a given matrix, and orthogonal matrices. The resulting CS regularizers are simple, differentiable, and can be free of spurious stationary points, making them suitable for gradient-based solvers and large-scale optimization problems. In addition, CS regularizers automatically adapt to the appropriate scale, which is, for example, beneficial when discretizing the weights of neural networks. To demonstrate the efficacy of CS regularizers, we provide results for solving underdetermined systems of linear equations and weight quantization in neural networks. Furthermore, we discuss specializations, variations, and generalizations, which lead to an even broader class of new and possibly more powerful regularizers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025</p></details> |

We introduce TxAgent, an AI agent that leverages multi-step reasoning and real-time biomedical knowledge retrieval across a toolbox of 211 tools to analyze drug interactions, contraindications, and patient-specific treatment strategies. TxAgent evaluates how drugs interact at molecular, pharmacokinetic, and clinical levels, identifies contraindications based on patient comorbidities and concurrent medications, and tailors treatment strategies to individual patient characteristics. It retrieves and synthesizes evidence from multiple biomedical sources, assesses interactions between drugs and patient conditions, and refines treatment recommendations through iterative reasoning. It selects tools based on task objectives and executes structured function calls to solve therapeutic tasks that require clinical reasoning and cross-source validation. The ToolUniverse consolidates 211 tools from trusted sources, including all US FDA-approved drugs since 1939 and validated clinical insights from Open Targets. TxAgent outperforms leading LLMs, tool-use models, and reasoning agents across five new benchmarks: DrugPC, BrandPC, GenericPC, TreatmentPC, and DescriptionPC, covering 3,168 drug reasoning tasks and 456 personalized treatment scenarios. It achieves 92.1% accuracy in open-ended drug reasoning tasks, surpassing GPT-4o and outperforming DeepSeek-R1 (671B) in structured multi-step reasoning. TxAgent generalizes across drug name variants and descriptions. By integrating multi-step inference, real-time knowledge grounding, and tool-assisted decision-making, TxAgent ensures that treatment recommendations align with established clinical guidelines and real-world evidence, reducing the risk of adverse events and improving therapeutic decision-making.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://zitniklab.hms.harvard.edu/TxAgent TxAgent code: https://github.com/mims-harvard/TxAgent ToolUniverse code: https://github.com/mims-harvard/ToolUniverse</p></details> |
| **[Graph-Grounded LLMs: Leveraging Graphical Function Calling to Minimize LLM Hallucinations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10941v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) is rapidly expanding across various tasks that involve inherent graphical structures. Graphs are integral to a wide range of applications, including motion planning for autonomous vehicles, social networks, scene understanding, and knowledge graphs. Many problems, even those not initially perceived as graph-based, can be effectively addressed through graph theory. However, when applied to these tasks, LLMs often encounter challenges, such as hallucinations and mathematical inaccuracies. To overcome these limitations, we propose Graph-Grounded LLMs, a system that improves LLM performance on graph-related tasks by integrating a graph library through function calls. By grounding LLMs in this manner, we demonstrate significant reductions in hallucinations and improved mathematical accuracy in solving graph-based problems, as evidenced by the performance on the NLGraph benchmark. Finally, we showcase a disaster rescue application where the Graph-Grounded LLM acts as a decision-support system.</p></details> |  |
| **[LightPlanner: Unleashing the Reasoning Capabilities of Lightweight Large Language Models in Task Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08508v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, lightweight large language models (LLMs) have garnered significant attention in the robotics field due to their low computational resource requirements and suitability for edge deployment. However, in task planning -- particularly for complex tasks that involve dynamic semantic logic reasoning -- lightweight LLMs have underperformed. To address this limitation, we propose a novel task planner, LightPlanner, which enhances the performance of lightweight LLMs in complex task planning by fully leveraging their reasoning capabilities. Unlike conventional planners that use fixed skill templates, LightPlanner controls robot actions via parameterized function calls, dynamically generating parameter values. This approach allows for fine-grained skill control and improves task planning success rates in complex scenarios. Furthermore, we introduce hierarchical deep reasoning. Before generating each action decision step, LightPlanner thoroughly considers three levels: action execution (feedback verification), semantic parsing (goal consistency verification), and parameter generation (parameter validity verification). This ensures the correctness of subsequent action controls. Additionally, we incorporate a memory module to store historical actions, thereby reducing context length and enhancing planning efficiency for long-term tasks. We train the LightPlanner-1.5B model on our LightPlan-40k dataset, which comprises 40,000 action controls across tasks with 2 to 13 action steps. Experiments demonstrate that our model achieves the highest task success rate despite having the smallest number of parameters. In tasks involving spatial semantic reasoning, the success rate exceeds that of ReAct by 14.9 percent. Moreover, we demonstrate LightPlanner's potential to operate on edge devices.</p></details> |  |
| **[RefactorBench: Evaluating Stateful Reasoning in Language Agents Through Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07832v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in language model (LM) agents and function calling have enabled autonomous, feedback-driven systems to solve problems across various digital domains. To better understand the unique limitations of LM agents, we introduce RefactorBench, a benchmark consisting of 100 large handcrafted multi-file refactoring tasks in popular open-source repositories. Solving tasks within RefactorBench requires thorough exploration of dependencies across multiple files and strong adherence to relevant instructions. Every task is defined by 3 natural language instructions of varying specificity and is mutually exclusive, allowing for the creation of longer combined tasks on the same repository. Baselines on RefactorBench reveal that current LM agents struggle with simple compositional tasks, solving only 22% of tasks with base instructions, in contrast to a human developer with short time constraints solving 87%. Through trajectory analysis, we identify various unique failure modes of LM agents, and further explore the failure mode of tracking past actions. By adapting a baseline agent to condition on representations of state, we achieve a 43.9% improvement in solving RefactorBench tasks. We further extend our state-aware approach to encompass entire digital environments and outline potential directions for future research. RefactorBench aims to support the study of LM agents by providing a set of real-world, multi-hop tasks within the realm of code.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025 Camera Ready</p></details> |

However, their performance may be limited in complex, multi-turn interactions involving users and multiple tools. To address this, we propose Magnet, a principled framework for synthesizing high-quality training trajectories to enhance the function calling capability of large language model agents in multi-turn conversations with humans. The framework is based on automatic and iterative translations from a function signature path to a sequence of queries and executable function calls. We model the complicated function interactions in multi-turn cases with graph and design novel node operations to build reliable signature paths. Motivated by context distillation, when guiding the generation of positive and negative trajectories using a teacher model, we provide reference function call sequences as positive hints in context and contrastive, incorrect function calls as negative hints. Experiments show that training with the positive trajectories with supervised fine-tuning and preference optimization against negative trajectories, our 14B model, Magnet-14B-mDPO, obtains 68.01 on BFCL-v3 and 73.30 on ToolQuery, surpassing the performance of the teacher model Gemini-1.5-pro-002 by a large margin in function calling.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 3 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

However, when adapting speculative decoding to domain-specific target models, the acceptance rate of the generic draft model drops significantly due to domain shift. In this work, we systematically investigate knowledge distillation techniques for training domain draft models to improve their speculation accuracy. We compare white-box and black-box distillation approaches and explore their effectiveness in various data accessibility scenarios, including historical user queries, curated domain data, and synthetically generated alignment data. Our experiments across Function Calling, Biology, and Chinese domains show that offline distillation consistently outperforms online distillation by 11% to 25%, white-box distillation surpasses black-box distillation by 2% to 10%, and data scaling trends hold across domains. Additionally, we find that synthetic data can effectively align draft models and achieve 80% to 93% of the performance of training on historical user queries. These findings provide practical guidelines for training domain-specific draft models to improve speculative decoding efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a workshop paper at SCOPE - ICLR 2025</p></details> |

Our framework addresses a critical gap in the web agent ecosystem with a production-ready solution that combines minimal serverless backend configuration, intuitive user and browser interfaces, and extensible research capabilities in agent planning, memory, and tree search. For the core LiteWebAgent agent framework, we implemented a simple yet effective baseline using recursive function calling, providing with decoupled action generation and action grounding. In addition, we integrate advanced research components such as agent planning, agent workflow memory, and tree search in a modular and extensible manner. We then integrate the LiteWebAgent agent framework with frontend and backend as deployed systems in two formats: (1) a production Vercel-based web application, which provides users with an agent-controlled remote browser, (2) a Chrome extension leveraging LiteWebAgent's API to control an existing Chrome browser via CDP (Chrome DevTools Protocol).

| **[CoCoNUT: Structural Code Understanding does not fall out of a tree](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16456v3)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance across a wide array of tasks involving both structured and unstructured textual data. Recent results on various benchmarks for code generation, repair, or completion suggest that certain models have programming abilities comparable to or even surpass humans. In this work, we demonstrate that high performance on such benchmarks does not correlate to humans' innate ability to understand structural control flow in code. To this end, we extract solutions from the HumanEval benchmark, which the relevant models perform strongly on, and trace their execution path using function calls sampled from the respective test set. Using this dataset, we investigate the ability of seven state-of-the-art LLMs to match the execution trace and find that, despite their ability to generate semantically identical code, they possess limited ability to trace execution paths, especially for longer traces and specific control structures. We find that even the top-performing model, Gemini, can fully and correctly generate only 47% of HumanEval task traces. Additionally, we introduce a subset for three key structures not contained in HumanEval: Recursion, Parallel Processing, and Object-Oriented Programming, including concepts like Inheritance and Polymorphism. Besides OOP, we show that none of the investigated models achieve an accuracy over 5% on the relevant traces. Aggregating these specialized parts with HumanEval tasks, we present CoCoNUT: Code Control Flow for Navigation Understanding and Testing, which measures a model's ability to trace execution of code upon relevant calls, including advanced structural components. We conclude that current LLMs need significant improvement to enhance code reasoning abilities. We hope our dataset helps researchers bridge this gap.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 2025 IEEE/ACM International Workshop on Large Language Models for Code (LLM4Code)</p></details> |

Programmers are required by regulations or application stores to provide privacy notices and labels describing these privacy behaviors. Although many tools and research prototypes have been developed to help programmers generate these notices by analyzing the source code, these approaches are often fairly coarse-grained (i.e., at the level of whole methods or files, rather than at the statement level). But this is not necessarily how privacy behaviors exist in code. Privacy behaviors are embedded in specific statements in code. Current literature does not examine what statements programmers see as most important, how consistent these views are, or how to detect them. In this paper, we conduct an empirical study to examine which statements programmers view as most-related to privacy behaviors. We find that expression statements that make function calls are most associated with privacy behaviors, while the type of privacy label has little effect on the attributes of the selected statements. We then propose an approach to automatically detect these privacy-relevant statements by fine-tuning three large language models with the data from the study. We observe that the agreement between our approach and participants is comparable to or higher than an agreement between two participants. Our study and detection approach can help programmers understand which statements in code affect privacy in mobile applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 8 figures, under review</p></details> |

Existing approaches rely on expensive human annotation, making them unsustainable at scale. We propose AgentTrek, a scalable data synthesis pipeline that generates web agent trajectories by leveraging publicly available tutorials. Our three-stage method: (1) automatically harvests and filters tutorial-like texts from the internet using a specialized classification model, (2) transforms these texts into structured task specifications with step-by-step instructions, and (3) employs a visual-language model (VLM) agent to execute these instructions in real environments, while a VLM-based evaluator verifies trajectory correctness. The synthesized trajectories encompass multiple modalities, including text-based HTML observations with function-calling API actions, and vision-based screenshot observations with pixel-level actions. This multimodal data, enriched with chain-of-thought reasoning, enables agents to achieve state-of-the-art performance on both textual web browsing benchmarks (e.g., WebArena) and visual web grounding and browsing benchmarks (e.g., ScreenSpot Web and Multimodal Mind2Web). Furthermore, our fully automated approach significantly reduces data collection costs, achieving a cost of just $0.55 per high-quality trajectory without human annotators. Our work demonstrates that guided replay using web tutorials is a practical and scalable strategy for training advanced GUI agents, paving the way for more capable and autonomous digital assistants.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR2...</summary><p>ICLR2025 Spotlight https://agenttrek.github.io</p></details> |

While current research on function calling by LLMs primarily focuses on single-turn interactions, this paper addresses the overlooked necessity for LLMs to engage in multi-turn function calling--critical for handling compositional, real-world queries that require planning with functions but not only use functions. To facilitate this, we introduce an approach, BUTTON, which generates synthetic compositional instruction tuning data via bottom-up instruction construction and top-down trajectory generation. In the bottom-up phase, we generate simple atomic tasks based on real-world scenarios and build compositional tasks using heuristic strategies based on atomic tasks. Corresponding function definitions are then synthesized for these compositional tasks. The top-down phase features a multi-agent environment where interactions among simulated humans, assistants, and tools are utilized to gather multi-turn function calling trajectories. This approach ensures task compositionality and allows for effective function and trajectory generation by examining atomic tasks within compositional tasks. We produce a dataset BUTTONInstruct comprising 8k data points and demonstrate its effectiveness through extensive experiments across various LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025</p></details> |

At the same time, large copyright lawsuits and legislation such as GDPR have highlighted the need for erasing datapoints from diffusion models. However, retraining from scratch is often too expensive. This motivates the setting of data unlearning, i.e., the study of efficient techniques for unlearning specific datapoints from the training set. Existing concept unlearning techniques require an anchor prompt/class/distribution to guide unlearning, which is not available in the data unlearning setting. General-purpose machine unlearning techniques were found to be either unstable or failed to unlearn data. We therefore propose a family of new loss functions called Subtracted Importance Sampled Scores (SISS) that utilize importance sampling and are the first method to unlearn data with theoretical guarantees. SISS is constructed as a weighted combination between simpler objectives that are responsible for preserving model quality and unlearning the targeted datapoints. When evaluated on CelebA-HQ and MNIST, SISS achieved Pareto optimality along the quality and unlearning strength dimensions. On Stable Diffusion, SISS successfully mitigated memorization on nearly 90% of the prompts we tested.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

However, the lack of standardisation in text preprocessing creates diversity in mapping results. In this paper, we investigate the effect of the text preprocessing pipeline on syntactic OM in 8 Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI) tracks with 49 distinct alignments. We find that Phase 1 text preprocessing (Tokenisation and Normalisation) is currently more effective than Phase 2 text preprocessing (Stop Words Removal and Stemming/Lemmatisation). To repair the less effective Phase 2 text preprocessing caused by unwanted false mappings, we propose a novel context-based pipeline repair approach that employs an ad hoc check to find common words that cause false mappings. These words are stored in a reserved word set and applied in text preprocessing. The experimental results show that our approach improves the matching correctness and the overall matching performance. We also discuss the integration of the classical text preprocessing pipeline with modern large language models (LLMs). We recommend that LLMs inject the text preprocessing pipeline via function calling to avoid the tendency towards unstable true mappings produced by prompt-based LLM approaches, and use LLMs to repair false mappings generated by the text preprocessing pipeline.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 11 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

To mitigate the distribution shift commonly observed in ORL problems, we further employ a robust and non-causal Model Predictive Control (MPC) expert steering a nominal model of the dynamics using in-hindsight information stemming from the model mismatch. Unlike the existing literature, our robust MPC expert enjoys an exact and tractable convex reformulation. In the second part of this study, we show that the IO hypothesis class, trained by the proposed convex loss function, enjoys ample expressiveness and achieves competitive performance comparing with the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in the low-data regime of the MuJoCo benchmark while utilizing three orders of magnitude fewer parameters, thereby requiring significantly fewer computational resources. To facilitate the reproducibility of our results, we provide an open-source package implementing the proposed algorithms and the experiments.</p></details> | preprint |
| **[I Know What I Don't Know: Improving Model Cascades Through Confidence Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19335v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale machine learning models deliver strong performance across a wide range of tasks but come with significant computational and resource constraints. To mitigate these challenges, local smaller models are often deployed alongside larger models, relying on routing and deferral mechanisms to offload complex tasks. However, existing approaches inadequately balance the capabilities of these models, often resulting in unnecessary deferrals or sub-optimal resource usage. In this work we introduce a novel loss function called Gatekeeper for calibrating smaller models in cascade setups. Our approach fine-tunes the smaller model to confidently handle tasks it can perform correctly while deferring complex tasks to the larger model. Moreover, it incorporates a mechanism for managing the trade-off between model performance and deferral accuracy, and is broadly applicable across various tasks and domains without any architectural changes. We evaluate our method on encoder-only, decoder-only, and encoder-decoder architectures. Experiments across image classification, language modeling, and vision-language tasks show that our approach substantially improves deferral performance.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing approaches focus on mainstream languages such as Python and Java, neglecting the Solidity language, the predominant programming language for Ethereum smart contracts. Due to the lack of adequate benchmarks for Solidity, LLMs' ability to generate secure, cost-effective smart contracts remains unexplored. To fill this gap, we construct SolEval, the first repository-level benchmark designed for Solidity smart contract generation, to evaluate the performance of LLMs on Solidity. SolEval consists of 1,125 samples from 9 different repositories, covering 6 popular domains, providing LLMs with a comprehensive evaluation benchmark. Unlike the existing Solidity benchmark, SolEval not only includes complex function calls but also reflects the real-world complexity of the Ethereum ecosystem by incorporating gas fee and vulnerability rate. We evaluate 10 LLMs on SolEval, and our results show that the best-performing LLM achieves only 26.29% Pass@10, highlighting substantial room for improvement in Solidity code generation by LLMs. We release our data and code at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/SolEval-1C06/.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Simple Introduction to the SiMPL Method for Density-Based Topology Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19421v3)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a novel method for solving density-based topology optimization problems: Sigmoidal Mirror descent with a Projected Latent variable (SiMPL). The SiMPL method (pronounced as ``the simple method'') optimizes a design using only first-order derivative information of the objective function. The bound constraints on the density field are enforced with the help of the (negative) Fermi--Dirac entropy, which is also used to define a non-symmetric distance function called a Bregman divergence on the set of admissible designs. This Bregman divergence leads to a simple update rule that is further simplified with the help of a so-called latent variable. Because the SiMPL method involves discretizing the latent variable, it produces a sequence of pointwise-feasible iterates, even when high-order finite elements are used in the discretization. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the method outperforms other popular first-order optimization algorithms. To outline the general applicability of the technique, we include examples with (self-load) compliance minimization and compliant mechanism optimization problems.</p></details> |  |

CoALM: A Unified Conversational Agentic Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08820v3)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) with API-calling capabilities enabled building effective Language Agents (LA), while also revolutionizing the conventional task-oriented dialogue (TOD) paradigm. However, current approaches face a critical dilemma: TOD systems are often trained on a limited set of target APIs, requiring new data to maintain their quality when interfacing with new services, while LAs are not trained to maintain user intent over multi-turn conversations. Because both robust multi-turn management and advanced function calling are crucial for effective conversational agents, we evaluate these skills on three popular benchmarks: MultiWOZ 2.4 (TOD), BFCL V3 (LA), and API-Bank (LA), and our analyses reveal that specialized approaches excel in one domain but underperform in the other. To bridge this chasm, we introduce CoALM (Conversational Agentic Language Model), a unified approach that integrates both conversational and agentic capabilities. We created CoALM-IT, a carefully constructed multi-task dataset that interleave multi-turn ReAct reasoning with complex API usage. Using CoALM-IT, we train three models CoALM 8B, CoALM 70B, and CoALM 405B, which outperform top domain-specific models, including GPT-4o, across all three benchmarks. This demonstrates the feasibility of a single model approach for both TOD and LA, setting a new standard for conversational agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[Malware Detection based on API calls](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12863v1)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Malware attacks pose a significant threat in today's interconnected digital landscape, causing billions of dollars in damages. Detecting and identifying families as early as possible provides an edge in protecting against such malware. We explore a lightweight, order-invariant approach to detecting and mitigating malware threats: analyzing API calls without regard to their sequence. We publish a public dataset of over three hundred thousand samples and their function call parameters for this task, annotated with labels indicating benign or malicious activity. The complete dataset is above 550GB uncompressed in size. We leverage machine learning algorithms, such as random forests, and conduct behavioral analysis by examining patterns and anomalies in API call sequences. By investigating how the function calls occur regardless of their order, we can identify discriminating features that can help us identify malware early on. The models we've developed are not only effective but also efficient. They are lightweight and can run on any machine with minimal performance overhead, while still achieving an impressive F1-Score of over 85\%. We also empirically show that we only need a subset of the function call sequence, specifically calls to the ntdll.dll library, to identify malware. Our research demonstrates the efficacy of this approach through empirical evaluations, underscoring its accuracy and scalability. The code is open source and available at Github along with the dataset on Zenodo.</p></details> |  |

However, their capacity to solve Capture the Flag (CTF) challenges in cybersecurity has not been thoroughly evaluated. To address this, we develop a novel method to assess LLMs in solving CTF challenges by creating a scalable, open-source benchmark database specifically designed for these applications. This database includes metadata for LLM testing and adaptive learning, compiling a diverse range of CTF challenges from popular competitions. Utilizing the advanced function calling capabilities of LLMs, we build a fully automated system with an enhanced workflow and support for external tool calls. Our benchmark dataset and automated framework allow us to evaluate the performance of five LLMs, encompassing both black-box and open-source models. This work lays the foundation for future research into improving the efficiency of LLMs in interactive cybersecurity tasks and automated task planning. By providing a specialized benchmark, our project offers an ideal platform for developing, testing, and refining LLM-based approaches to vulnerability detection and resolution. Evaluating LLMs on these challenges and comparing with human performance yields insights into their potential for AI-driven cybersecurity solutions to perform real-world threat management. We make our benchmark dataset open source to public https://github.com/NYU-LLM-CTF/NYU_CTF_Bench along with our playground automated framework https://github.com/NYU-LLM-CTF/llm_ctf_automation.</p></details> |  |
| **[FlexFL: Flexible and Effective Fault Localization with Open-Source Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10714v2)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the impressive code comprehension ability of Large Language Models (LLMs), a few studies have proposed to leverage LLMs to locate bugs, i.e., LLM-based FL, and demonstrated promising performance. However, first, these methods are limited in flexibility. They rely on bug-triggering test cases to perform FL and cannot make use of other available bug-related information, e.g., bug reports. Second, they are built upon proprietary LLMs, which are, although powerful, confronted with risks in data privacy. To address these limitations, we propose a novel LLM-based FL framework named FlexFL, which can flexibly leverage different types of bug-related information and effectively work with open-source LLMs. FlexFL is composed of two stages. In the first stage, FlexFL reduces the search space of buggy code using state-of-the-art FL techniques of different families and provides a candidate list of bug-related methods. In the second stage, FlexFL leverages LLMs to delve deeper to double-check the code snippets of methods suggested by the first stage and refine fault localization results. In each stage, FlexFL constructs agents based on open-source LLMs, which share the same pipeline that does not postulate any type of bug-related information and can interact with function calls without the out-of-the-box capability. Extensive experimental results on Defects4J demonstrate that FlexFL outperforms the baselines and can work with different open-source LLMs. Specifically, FlexFL with a lightweight open-source LLM Llama3-8B can locate 42 and 63 more bugs than two state-of-the-art LLM-based FL approaches AutoFL and AgentFL that both use GPT-3.5.</p></details> | 17 pages, 4 figures |
| **[ReF Decompile: Relabeling and Function Call Enhanced Decompile](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12221v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The goal of decompilation is to convert compiled low-level code (e.g., assembly code) back into high-level programming languages, enabling analysis in scenarios where source code is unavailable. This task supports various reverse engineering applications, such as vulnerability identification, malware analysis, and legacy software migration. The end-to-end decompile method based on large langauge models (LLMs) reduces reliance on additional tools and minimizes manual intervention due to its inherent properties. However, previous end-to-end methods often lose critical information necessary for reconstructing control flow structures and variables when processing binary files, making it challenging to accurately recover the program's logic. To address these issues, we propose the \textbf{ReF Decompile} method, which incorporates the following innovations: (1) The Relabelling strategy replaces jump target addresses with labels, preserving control flow clarity. (2) The Function Call strategy infers variable types and retrieves missing variable information from binary files. Experimental results on the Humaneval-Decompile Benchmark demonstrate that ReF Decompile surpasses comparable baselines and achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance of $61.43\%$.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce HammerBench, a novel benchmark framework for assessing LLMs' function-calling capabilities in real-world, multi-turn dialogues. HammerBench simulates diverse mobile assistant use cases, incorporating imperfect instructions, dynamic question-answer trajectories, intent and argument shifts, and the indirect use of external information through pronouns. To construct this benchmark, we curate a comprehensive dataset derived from popular mobile app functionalities and anonymized user logs, complemented by a cost-effective data generation pipeline leveraging open-source models. HammerBench is further augmented with fine-grained interaction snapshots and metrics, enabling detailed evaluation of function-calling performance across individual conversational turns. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HammerBench by evaluating several leading LLMs and uncovering key performance trends. Our experiments reveal that different types of parameter name errors are a significant source of failure across different interaction scenarios, highlighting critical areas for further improvement in LLM robustness for mobile assistant applications.</p></details> |  |

Integrating AI agents into CRM systems can automate routine processes and enhance personalized service. However, deploying and evaluating these agents is challenging due to the lack of realistic benchmarks that reflect the complexity of real-world CRM tasks. To address this issue, we introduce CRMArena, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate AI agents on realistic tasks grounded in professional work environments. Following guidance from CRM experts and industry best practices, we designed CRMArena with nine customer service tasks distributed across three personas: service agent, analyst, and manager. The benchmark includes 16 commonly used industrial objects (e.g., account, order, knowledge article, case) with high interconnectivity, along with latent variables (e.g., complaint habits, policy violations) to simulate realistic data distributions. Experimental results reveal that state-of-the-art LLM agents succeed in less than 40% of the tasks with ReAct prompting, and less than 55% even with function-calling abilities. Our findings highlight the need for enhanced agent capabilities in function-calling and rule-following to be deployed in real-world work environments. CRMArena is an open challenge to the community: systems that can reliably complete tasks showcase direct business value in a popular work environment.</p></details> | NAACL 2025 |

In recent years, in order to apply MPL in more practical scenarios, various MPC-friendly models have been proposedto reduce the extraordinary communication overhead of MPL. Within the optimization of MPC-friendly models, a critical element to tackle the challenge is profiling the communication cost of models. However, the current solutions mainly depend on manually establishing the profiles to identify communication bottlenecks of models, often involving burdensome human efforts in a monotonous procedure. In this paper, we propose HawkEye, a static model communication cost profiling framework, which enables model designers to get the accurate communication cost of models in MPL frameworks without dynamically running the secure model training or inference processes on a specific MPL framework. Firstly, to profile the communication cost of models with complex structures, we propose a static communication cost profiling method based on a prefix structure that records the function calling chain during the static analysis. Secondly, HawkEye employs an automatic differentiation library to assist model designers in profiling the communication cost of models in PyTorch. Finally, we compare the static profiling results of HawkEye against the profiling results obtained through dynamically running secure model training and inference processes on five popular MPL frameworks, CryptFlow2, CrypTen, Delphi, Cheetah, and SecretFlow-SEMI2K. The experimental results show that HawkEye can accurately profile the model communication cost without dynamic profiling.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for publication at USENIX Security 2025.

| **[Combining Evidence Across Filtrations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09698v3)** | 2025-02-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In sequential anytime-valid inference, any admissible procedure must be based on e-processes: generalizations of test martingales that quantify the accumulated evidence against a composite null hypothesis at any stopping time. This paper proposes a method for combining e-processes constructed in different filtrations but for the same null. Although e-processes in the same filtration can be combined effortlessly (by averaging), e-processes in different filtrations cannot because their validity in a coarser filtration does not translate to a finer filtration. This issue arises in sequential tests of randomness and independence, as well as in the evaluation of sequential forecasters. We establish that a class of functions called adjusters can lift arbitrary e-processes across filtrations. The result yields a generally applicable "adjust-then-combine" procedure, which we demonstrate on the problem of testing randomness in real-world financial data. Furthermore, we prove a characterization theorem for adjusters that formalizes a sense in which using adjusters is necessary. There are two major implications. First, if we have a powerful e-process in a coarsened filtration, then we readily have a powerful e-process in the original filtration. Second, when we coarsen the filtration to construct an e-process, there is a logarithmic cost to recovering validity in the original filtration.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review.

However, existing environments are often domain-specific and require complex setups, which limits agent development and evaluation in real-world settings. As a result, current evaluations lack in-depth analyses that decompose fundamental agent capabilities. We introduce AgentStudio, a trinity of environments, tools, and benchmarks to address these issues. AgentStudio provides a lightweight, interactive environment with highly generic observation and action spaces, e.g., video observations and GUI/API actions. It integrates tools for creating online benchmark tasks, annotating GUI elements, and labeling actions in videos. Based on our environment and tools, we curate an online task suite that benchmarks both GUI interactions and function calling with efficient auto-evaluation. We also reorganize existing datasets and collect new ones using our tools to establish three datasets: GroundUI, IDMBench, and CriticBench. These datasets evaluate fundamental agent abilities, including GUI grounding, learning from videos, and success detection, pointing to the desiderata for robust, general, and open-ended virtual agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025.

This paper introduces and analyzes overthinking in LRMs. A phenomenon where models favor extended internal reasoning chains over environmental interaction. Through experiments on software engineering tasks using SWE Bench Verified, we observe three recurring patterns: Analysis Paralysis, Rogue Actions, and Premature Disengagement. We propose a framework to study these behaviors, which correlates with human expert assessments, and analyze 4018 trajectories. We observe that higher overthinking scores correlate with decreased performance, with reasoning models exhibiting stronger tendencies toward overthinking compared to non-reasoning models. Our analysis reveals that simple efforts to mitigate overthinking in agentic environments, such as selecting the solution with the lower overthinking score, can improve model performance by almost 30% while reducing computational costs by 43%. These results suggest that mitigating overthinking has strong practical implications. We suggest that by leveraging native function-calling capabilities and selective reinforcement learning overthinking tendencies could be mitigated. We also open-source our evaluation framework and dataset to facilitate research in this direction at https://github.com/AlexCuadron/Overthinking.</p></details> |  |

It allows software engineers to develop cloud applications as a set of functions (called serverless functions). However, accurately measuring the performance (i.e., end-to-end response latency) of serverless functions is challenging due to the highly dynamic nature of the environment in which they run. To tackle this problem, a potential solution is to apply checks of performance testing techniques to determine how many repetitions of a given serverless function across a range of inputs are needed to cater to the performance fluctuation. However, the available literature lacks performance testing approaches designed explicitly for serverless computing. In this paper, we propose SCOPE, the first serverless computing-oriented performance testing approach. SCOPE takes into account the unique performance characteristics of serverless functions, such as their short execution durations and on-demand triggering. As such, SCOPE is designed as a fine-grained analysis approach. SCOPE incorporates the accuracy check and the consistency check to obtain the accurate and reliable performance of serverless functions. The evaluation shows that SCOPE provides testing results with 97.25% accuracy, 33.83 percentage points higher than the best currently available technique. Moreover, the superiority of SCOPE over the state-of-the-art holds on all functions that we study.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology (TOSEM)</p></details> |

However, most traditional methods require predefined module design, making it hard to generalize to different goals. Recent large language model based approaches can allow for more open-ended planning but often require heavy prompt engineering or domain specific pretrained models. To tackle this, we propose a simple framework that achieves interactive task planning with language models by incorporating both high-level planning and low-level skill execution through function calling, leveraging pretrained vision models to ground the scene in language. We verify the robustness of our system on the real world task of making milk tea drinks. Our system is able to generate novel high-level instructions for unseen objectives and successfully accomplishes user tasks. Furthermore, when the user sends a new request, our system is able to replan accordingly with precision based on the new request, task guidelines and previously executed steps. Our approach is easy to adapt to different tasks by simply substituting the task guidelines, without the need for additional complex prompt engineering.

| **[Optimal Neural Network Approximation for High-Dimensional Continuous Functions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02363v3)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, the authors of Shen Yang Zhang (JMLR, 2022) developed a neural network with width $36d(2d + 1)$ and depth $11$, which utilizes a special activation function called the elementary universal activation function, to achieve the super approximation property for functions in $C([a,b]^d)$. That is, the constructed network only requires a fixed number of neurons (and thus parameters) to approximate a $d$-variate continuous function on a $d$-dimensional hypercube with arbitrary accuracy. More specifically, only $\mathcal{O}(d^2)$ neurons or parameters are used. One natural question is whether we can reduce the number of these neurons or parameters in such a network. By leveraging a variant of the Kolmogorov Superposition Theorem, our analysis shows that there is a neural network generated by the elementary universal activation function with at most $10889d+10887$ unique nonzero parameters such that this super approximation property is attained. Furthermore, we present a family of continuous functions that requires at least width $d$, and thus at least $d$ neurons or parameters, to achieve arbitrary accuracy in its approximation. This suggests that the number of unique nonzero parameters is optimal in the sense that it grows linearly with the input dimension $d$, unlike some approximation methods where parameters may grow exponentially with $d$.</p></details> |  |
| **[Following Devils' Footprint: Towards Real-time Detection of Price Manipulation Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03718v1)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Price manipulation attack is one of the notorious threats in decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, which allows attackers to exchange tokens at an extensively deviated price from the market. Existing efforts usually rely on reactive methods to identify such kind of attacks after they have happened, e.g., detecting attack transactions in the post-attack stage, which cannot mitigate or prevent price manipulation attacks timely. From the perspective of attackers, they usually need to deploy attack contracts in the pre-attack stage. Thus, if we can identify these attack contracts in a proactive manner, we can raise alarms and mitigate the threats. With the core idea in mind, in this work, we shift our attention from the victims to the attackers. Specifically, we propose SMARTCAT, a novel approach for identifying price manipulation attacks in the pre-attack stage proactively. For generality, it conducts analysis on bytecode and does not require any source code and transaction data. For accuracy, it depicts the control- and data-flow dependency relationships among function calls into a token flow graph. For scalability, it filters out those suspicious paths, in which it conducts inter-contract analysis as necessary. To this end, SMARTCAT can pinpoint attacks in real time once they have been deployed on a chain. The evaluation results illustrate that SMARTCAT significantly outperforms existing baselines with 91.6% recall and ~100% precision. Moreover, SMARTCAT also uncovers 616 attack contracts in-the-wild, accounting for \$9.25M financial losses, with only 19 cases publicly reported. By applying SMARTCAT as a real-time detector in Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain, it has raised 14 alarms 99 seconds after the corresponding deployment on average. These attacks have already led to $641K financial losses, and seven of them are still waiting for their ripe time.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear on the Usenix Security 2025</p></details> |
| **[Semantic Entanglement-Based Ransomware Detection via Probabilistic Latent Encryption Mapping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02730v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Encryption-based attacks have introduced significant challenges for detection mechanisms that rely on predefined signatures, heuristic indicators, or static rule-based classifications. Probabilistic Latent Encryption Mapping presents an alternative detection framework that models ransomware-induced encryption behaviors through statistical representations of entropy deviations and probabilistic dependencies in execution traces. Unlike conventional approaches that depend on explicit bytecode analysis or predefined cryptographic function call monitoring, probabilistic inference techniques classify encryption anomalies based on their underlying statistical characteristics, ensuring greater adaptability to polymorphic attack strategies. Evaluations demonstrate that entropy-driven classification reduces false positive rates while maintaining high detection accuracy across diverse ransomware families and encryption methodologies. Experimental results further highlight the framework's ability to differentiate between benign encryption workflows and adversarial cryptographic manipulations, ensuring that classification performance remains effective across cloud-based and localized execution environments. Benchmark comparisons illustrate that probabilistic modeling exhibits advantages over heuristic and machine learning-based detection approaches, particularly in handling previously unseen encryption techniques and adversarial obfuscation strategies. Computational efficiency analysis confirms that detection latency remains within operational feasibility constraints, reinforcing the viability of probabilistic encryption classification for real-time security infrastructures. The ability to systematically infer encryption-induced deviations without requiring static attack signatures strengthens detection robustness against adversarial evasion techniques.</p></details> |  |
| **[Approximating Competitive Equilibrium by Nash Welfare](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09994v2)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We explore the relationship between two popular concepts in the allocation of divisible items: competitive equilibrium (CE) and allocations with maximum Nash welfare, i.e., allocations where the weighted geometric mean of the utilities is maximal. When agents have homogeneous concave utility functions, these two concepts coincide: the classical Eisenberg-Gale convex program that maximizes Nash welfare over feasible allocations yields a competitive equilibrium. However, these two concepts diverge for non-homogeneous utilities. From a computational perspective, maximizing Nash welfare amounts to solving a convex program for any concave utility functions, computing CE becomes PPAD-hard already for separable piecewise linear concave (SPLC) utilities. We introduce the concept of Gale-substitute utility functions, which is an analogue of the weak gross substitutes (WGS) property for the so-called Gale demand system. For Gale-substitutes utilities, we show that any allocation maximizing Nash welfare provides an approximate-CE with surprisingly strong guarantees, where every agent gets at least half the maximum utility they can get at any CE, and is approximately envy-free. Gale-substitutes include utility functions where computing CE is PPAD hard, such as all separable concave utilities and the previously studied non-separable class of Leontief-free utilities. We introduce a broad new class of utility functions called generalized network utilities based on the generalized flow model. This class includes SPLC and Leontief-free utilities, and we show that all such utilities are Gale-substitutes. Conversely, although some agents may get much higher utility at a Nash welfare maximizing allocation than at a CE, we show a price of anarchy type result: for general concave utilities, every CE achieves at least $(1/e)^{1/e} > 0.69$ fraction of the maximum Nash welfare, and this factor is tight.</p></details> |  |
| **[Programming by Examples Meets Historical Linguistics: A Large Language Model Based Approach to Sound Law Induction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16524v1)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Historical linguists have long written "programs" that convert reconstructed words in an ancestor language into their attested descendants via ordered string rewrite functions (called sound laws) However, writing these programs is time-consuming, motivating the development of automated Sound Law Induction (SLI) which we formulate as Programming by Examples (PBE) with Large Language Models (LLMs) in this paper. While LLMs have been effective for code generation, recent work has shown that PBE is challenging but improvable by fine-tuning, especially with training data drawn from the same distribution as evaluation data. In this paper, we create a conceptual framework of what constitutes a "similar distribution" for SLI and propose four kinds of synthetic data generation methods with varying amounts of inductive bias to investigate what leads to the best performance. Based on the results we create a SOTA open-source model for SLI as PBE (+6% pass rate with a third of the parameters of the second-best LLM) and also highlight exciting future directions for PBE research.</p></details> |  |

Moving one step toward more sophisticated audio agent from recent advancement in end-to-end (E2E) speech systems, we propose LUCY, a E2E speech model that (1) senses and responds to user's emotion, (2) deliver responses in a succinct and natural style, and (3) use external tool to answer real-time inquiries. Experiment results show that LUCY is better at emotion control than peer models, generating emotional responses based on linguistic emotional instructions and responding to paralinguistic emotional cues. Lucy is also able to generate responses in a more natural style, as judged by external language models, without sacrificing much performance on general question answering. Finally, LUCY can leverage function calls to answer questions that are out of its knowledge scope.</p></details> | <details><summary>Demo ...</summary><p>Demo Link: https://github.com/VITA-MLLM/LUCY</p></details> |

This new activation function enables adaptive feature selection and extends to the complex domain, capturing phase-sensitive and hierarchical relationships within data. Notably, it provides greater interpretability and transparency compared to existing machine learning models, facilitating a deeper understanding of its functionality and decision-making processes. We analyze the mathematical properties of both real-valued and complex-valued Lehmer activation units and demonstrate their applications in modeling nonlinear interactions. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our proposed neural network achieves competitive accuracy on benchmark datasets with significantly improved computational efficiency. A single layer of real-valued or complex-valued Lehmer activation units is shown to deliver state-of-the-art performance, balancing efficiency with interpretability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Querying Databases with Function Calling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00032v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly accelerating largely thanks to their integration with external tools. Querying databases is among the most effective of these integrations, enabling LLMs to access private or continually updating data. While Function Calling is the most common method for interfacing external tools to LLMs, its application to database querying as a tool has been underexplored. We propose a tool definition for database querying that unifies accessing data with search queries, filters, or a combination both, as well as transforming results with aggregation and groupby operators. To evaluate its effectiveness, we conduct a study with 8 LLMs spanning 5 model families. We present a novel pipeline adapting the Gorilla LLM framework to create synthetic database schemas and queries. We primarily evaluate the models with the Exact Match of predicted and ground truth query APIs. Among the models tested, Claude 3.5 Sonnet achieves the highest performance with an Exact Match score of 74.3%, followed by GPT-4o mini at 73.7%, and GPT-4o at 71.8%. We further breakdown these results per API component utilized and across synthetic use cases. We find that LLMs are highly effective at utilizing operators on boolean properties, but struggle with text property filters. Across use cases we find robust results with the higher performing models such as GPT-4o, but significant performance variance across use cases from lower performing models. We additionally conduct ablation studies exploring the impact of parallel tool calling, adding a rationale as an argument of the tool call, using a separate tool per database collection, and tool calling with structured outputs. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of enabling LLMs to query databases with Function Calling. We have open-sourced our experimental code and results at github.com/weaviate/gorilla.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint. 23 pages, 7 figures</p></details> |

At the core of these agents, an LLM must plan, execute, and respond using external tools, APIs, and custom functions. Research on tool calling has gathered momentum, but evaluation benchmarks and datasets representing the complexity of the tasks have lagged behind. In this work, we focus on one such complexity, nested sequencing, with the goal of extending existing benchmarks and evaluation. Specifically, we present NESTFUL, a benchmark to evaluate LLMs on nested sequences of API calls, i.e., sequences where the output of one API call is passed as input to a subsequent call. NESTFUL contains 1800+ nested sequences where all the function calls are executable. Experimental results on multiple models and settings show that the best-performing model on the dataset has a full sequence match accuracy of 25% and win-rate of 34% necessitating a large scope for improvement in the nested sequencing aspect of function calling. Our analysis of these results provides possible future research directions for the community, in addition to a benchmark to track progress. We have released the NESTFUL dataset under the Apache 2.0 license at https://github.com/IBM/NESTFUL.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bypassing Array Canaries via Autonomous Function Call Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13256v1)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We observed the Array Canary, a novel JavaScript anti-analysis technique currently exploited in-the-wild by the Phishing-as-a-Service framework Darcula. The Array Canary appears to be an advanced form of the array shuffling techniques employed by the Emotet JavaScript downloader. In practice, a series of Array Canaries are set within a string array and if modified will cause the program to endlessly loop. In this paper, we demonstrate how an Array Canary works and discuss Autonomous Function Call Resolution (AFCR), which is a method we created to bypass Array Canaries. We also introduce Arphsy, a proof-of-concept for AFCR designed to guide Large Language Models and security researchers in the deobfuscation of "canaried" JavaScript code. We accomplish this by (i) Finding and extracting all Immediately Invoked Function Expressions from a canaried file, (ii) parsing the file's Abstract Syntax Tree for any function that does not implement imported function calls, (iii) identifying the most reassigned variable and its corresponding function body, (iv) calculating the length of the largest string array and uses it to determine the offset values within the canaried file, (v) aggregating all the previously identified functions into a single file, and (vi) appending driver code into the verified file and using it to deobfuscate the canaried file.</p></details> |  |

Mainstream methods, such as CoT/ReAct, rely on step-by-step tool invocation to interact with external environments, but they are limited in perceptual scope and lack adequate task-planning capability. To address these limitations, other studies introduce the first Search-based Decision Tree (DFSDT), which still suffers from the high computational cost. In this paper, we introduce a novel parallel tool invocation paradigm, DTA-Llama (Divide-Then-Aggregate Llama). First, we transform traditional tree-based tool search paths into Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structure, generating a high-quality parallel tool invocation dataset. The DTA-Llama is then trained on the dataset to learn to iteratively divide the current task into several parallel tool invocation sub-tasks and aggregate the invocation results to decide the next actions. Furthermore, we introduce an efficient inference framework inspired by the Process/Threads mechanism when applying the DTA-Llama to practical tasks. Experimental results show that our approach substantially enhances task performance while reducing token consumption and inference time. Llama2-7B, using our method, is comparable to the official parallel function calling method of GPT-3.5. The relevant code, dataset, and model weights are available at https://corn0205.github.io/</p></details> |  |

Current approaches to enable tool usage often rely on model-specific prompting or fine-tuning a model for function-calling instructions. Both approaches have notable limitations, including reduced adaptability to unseen tools and high resource requirements. This paper introduces FREYR, a streamlined framework that modularizes the tool usage process into separate steps. Through this decomposition, we show that FREYR achieves superior performance compared to conventional tool usage methods. We evaluate FREYR on a set of real-world test cases specific for video game design and compare it against traditional tool usage as provided by the Ollama API.</p></details> | 15 pages |

We rank the optimisers with respect to metrics such as final energy achieved and function calls needed to get within a certain tolerance level, and find that the best performing optimisers are variants of gradient descent such as Momentum and ADAM (using finite difference), SPSA, CMAES, and BayesMGD. We also perform gradient analysis and observe that the step size for finite difference has a very significant impact. We also consider using simultaneous perturbation (inspired by SPSA) as a gradient subroutine: here finite difference can lead to a more precise estimate of the ground state but uses more calls, whereas simultaneous perturbation can converge quicker but may be less precise in the later stages. Finally, we also study the quantum natural gradient algorithm: we implement this method for 1-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard systems, and find that whilst it can reach a lower energy with fewer iterations, this improvement is typically lost when taking total function calls into account. Our method involves performing careful hyperparameter sweeping on 4 instances. We present a variety of analysis and figures, detailed optimiser notes, and discuss future directions.</p></details> | <details><summary>43 pa...</summary><p>43 pages, 30 figures.

However, evaluating the function calling abilities of LLMs in real-world scenarios remains under-explored due to the complexity of data collection and evaluation. In this work, we introduce ComplexFuncBench, a benchmark for complex function calling across five real-world scenarios. Compared to existing benchmarks, ComplexFuncBench encompasses multi-step and constrained function calling, which requires long-parameter filing, parameter value reasoning, and 128k long context. Additionally, we propose an automatic framework, ComplexEval, for quantitatively evaluating complex function calling tasks. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate the deficiencies of state-of-the-art LLMs in function calling and suggest future directions for optimizing these capabilities.

| **[A General Framework for Inference-time Scaling and Steering of Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06848v3)** | 2025-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models produce impressive results in modalities ranging from images and video to protein design and text. However, generating samples with user-specified properties remains a challenge. Recent research proposes fine-tuning models to maximize rewards that capture desired properties, but these methods require expensive training and are prone to mode collapse. In this work, we propose Feynman Kac (FK) steering, an inference-time framework for steering diffusion models with reward functions. FK steering works by sampling a system of multiple interacting diffusion processes, called particles, and resampling particles at intermediate steps based on scores computed using functions called potentials. Potentials are defined using rewards for intermediate states and are selected such that a high value indicates that the particle will yield a high-reward sample. We explore various choices of potentials, intermediate rewards, and samplers. We evaluate FK steering on text-to-image and text diffusion models. For steering text-to-image models with a human preference reward, we find that FK steering a 0.8B parameter model outperforms a 2.6B parameter fine-tuned model on prompt fidelity, with faster sampling and no training. For steering text diffusion models with rewards for text quality and specific text attributes, we find that FK steering generates lower perplexity, more linguistically acceptable outputs and enables gradient-free control of attributes like toxicity. Our results demonstrate that inference-time scaling and steering of diffusion models, even with off-the-shelf rewards, can provide significant sample quality gains and controllability benefits.

These models are usually developed by optimization experts but are used by practitioners without optimization expertise in various application domains. As a result, practitioners often struggle to interact with and draw useful conclusions from optimization models independently. To fill this gap, we introduce OptiChat, a natural language dialogue system designed to help practitioners interpret model formulation, diagnose infeasibility, analyze sensitivity, retrieve information, evaluate modifications, and provide counterfactual explanations. By augmenting large language models (LLMs) with functional calls and code generation tailored for optimization models, we enable seamless interaction and minimize the risk of hallucinations in OptiChat. We develop a new dataset to evaluate OptiChat's performance in explaining optimization models. Experiments demonstrate that OptiChat effectively bridges the gap between optimization models and practitioners, delivering autonomous, accurate, and instant responses.</p></details> |  |

The approach is based on an embedding of the system into a higher-dimensional feature space in which the dynamics become quadratic. Just like SINDy (Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics), our method requires trajectory data, time derivatives for the training data points, which can also be estimated using finite difference approximations, and a set of preselected basis functions, called dictionary. We illustrate the efficacy and accuracy of QENDy with the aid of various benchmark problems and compare its performance with SINDy and a deep learning method for identifying quadratic embeddings. Furthermore, we analyze the convergence of QENDy and SINDy in the infinite data limit, highlight their similarities and main differences, and compare the quadratic embedding with linearization techniques based on the Koopman operator.</p></details> |  |

API calling in chatbot systems poses significant challenges, particularly in complex, multi-step tasks requiring accurate API selection and execution. We contribute to this domain in three ways: first, by introducing a novel dataset designed to assess models on API function selection, parameter generation, and nested API calls; second, by benchmarking state-of-the-art language models across varying levels of complexity to evaluate their performance in API function generation and parameter accuracy; and third, by proposing an enhanced API routing method that combines general-purpose large language models for API selection with fine-tuned models for parameter generation and some prompt engineering approach. These approaches lead to substantial improvements in handling complex API tasks, offering practical advancements for real-world API-driven chatbot systems.</p></details> |  |

However, progress has been hindered by a lack of reliable evaluation datasets. To address this, we present ToolHop, a dataset comprising 995 user queries and 3,912 associated tools, specifically designed for rigorous evaluation of multi-hop tool use. ToolHop ensures diverse queries, meaningful interdependencies, locally executable tools, detailed feedback, and verifiable answers through a novel query-driven data construction approach that includes tool creation, document refinement, and code generation. We evaluate 14 LLMs across five model families (i.e., LLaMA3.1, Qwen2.5, Gemini1.5, Claude3.5, and GPT), uncovering significant challenges in handling multi-hop tool-use scenarios. The leading model, GPT-4o, achieves an accuracy of 49.04%, underscoring substantial room for improvement. Further analysis reveals variations in tool-use strategies for various families, offering actionable insights to guide the development of more effective approaches.

| **[Optimizing Small Language Models for In-Vehicle Function-Calling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02342v1)** | 2025-01-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a holistic approach for deploying Small Language Models (SLMs) as function-calling agents within vehicles as edge devices, offering a more flexible and robust alternative to traditional rule-based systems. By leveraging SLMs, we simplify vehicle control mechanisms and enhance the user experience. Given the in-vehicle hardware constraints, we apply state-of-the-art model compression techniques, including structured pruning, healing, and quantization, ensuring that the model fits within the resource limitations while maintaining acceptable performance. Our work focuses on optimizing a representative SLM, Microsoft's Phi-3 mini, and outlines best practices for enabling embedded models, including compression, task-specific fine-tuning, and vehicle integration. We demonstrate that, despite significant reduction in model size which removes up to 2 billion parameters from the original model, our approach preserves the model's ability to handle complex in-vehicle tasks accurately and efficiently. Furthermore, by executing the model in a lightweight runtime environment, we achieve a generation speed of 11 tokens per second, making real-time, on-device inference feasible without hardware acceleration. Our results demonstrate the potential of SLMs to transform vehicle control systems, enabling more intuitive interactions between users and their vehicles for an enhanced driving experience.</p></details> |  |
| **[SR-Reward: Taking The Path More Traveled](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02330v1)** | 2025-01-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose a novel method for learning reward functions directly from offline demonstrations. Unlike traditional inverse reinforcement learning (IRL), our approach decouples the reward function from the learner's policy, eliminating the adversarial interaction typically required between the two. This results in a more stable and efficient training process. Our reward function, called \textit{SR-Reward}, leverages successor representation (SR) to encode a state based on expected future states' visitation under the demonstration policy and transition dynamics. By utilizing the Bellman equation, SR-Reward can be learned concurrently with most reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms without altering the existing training pipeline. We also introduce a negative sampling strategy to mitigate overestimation errors by reducing rewards for out-of-distribution data, thereby enhancing robustness. This strategy inherently introduces a conservative bias into RL algorithms that employ the learned reward. We evaluate our method on the D4RL benchmark, achieving competitive results compared to offline RL algorithms with access to true rewards and imitation learning (IL) techniques like behavioral cloning. Moreover, our ablation studies on data size and quality reveal the advantages and limitations of SR-Reward as a proxy for true rewards.</p></details> |  |

To tackle these challenges, this paper introduces ADC, an innovative approach that enhances LLMs' ability to follow function formats and match complex parameters. ADC utilizes a high-quality code fine-tuning dataset with line-level execution feedback, providing granular process supervision that fosters strong logical reasoning and adherence to function formats. It also employs an adversarial dataset generation process to improve parameter matching. The staged training methodology capitalizes on both enriched code datasets and refined adversarial datasets, leading to marked improvements in function calling capabilities on the Berkeley Function-Calling Leaderboard (BFCL) Benchmark. The innovation of ADC lies in its strategic combination of process supervision, adversarial refinement, and incremental learning, setting a new standard for LLM proficiency in complex function calling.</p></details> |  |

They are programs to determine cryptocurrency transactions, and are irreversible once deployed, making it crucial for cryptocurrency investors to understand the cryptocurrency transaction behaviors of smart contracts comprehensively. However, it is a challenging (if not impossible) task for investors, as they do not necessarily have a programming background to check the complex source code. Even for investors with certain programming skills, inferring all the potential behaviors from the code alone is still difficult, since the actual behaviors can be different when different investors are involved. To address this challenge, we propose PrettiSmart, a novel visualization approach via execution simulation to achieve intuitive and reliable visual interpretation of smart contracts. Specifically, we develop a simulator to comprehensively capture most of the possible real-world smart contract behaviors, involving multiple investors and various smart contract functions. Then, we present PrettiSmart to intuitively visualize the simulation results of a smart contract, which consists of two modules: The Simulation Overview Module is a barcode-based design, providing a visual summary for each simulation, and the Simulation Detail Module is an augmented sequential design to display the cryptocurrency transaction details in each simulation, such as function call sequences, cryptocurrency flows, and state variable changes. It can allow investors to intuitively inspect and understand how a smart contract will work. We evaluate PrettiSmart through two case studies and in-depth user interviews with 12 investors. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and usability of PrettiSmart in facilitating an easy interpretation of smart contracts.</p></details> |  |

While extensive research has been conducted on the safety of LLMs in chat mode, the security implications of their function calling feature have been largely overlooked. This paper uncovers a critical vulnerability in the function calling process of LLMs, introducing a novel "jailbreak function" attack method that exploits alignment discrepancies, user coercion, and the absence of rigorous safety filters. Our empirical study, conducted on six state-of-the-art LLMs including GPT-4o, Claude-3.5-Sonnet, and Gemini-1.5-pro, reveals an alarming average success rate of over 90\% for this attack. We provide a comprehensive analysis of why function calls are susceptible to such attacks and propose defensive strategies, including the use of defensive prompts. Our findings highlight the urgent need for enhanced security measures in the function calling capabilities of LLMs, contributing to the field of AI safety by identifying a previously unexplored risk, designing an effective attack method, and suggesting practical defensive measures.

Further improving the performance and robustness of community detection has attracted significant attention. This paper considers edge noise, which causes edges in the network to be added or removed. Existing methods achieve graph denoising through link prediction or robustness in low eigenvectors. However, they are either limited in application scenarios or not determined for effectiveness. We find that the noisy pixel in the adjacency matrix has a certain proportion in the loss function, which makes the optimization of the community detection model seriously deviate from the correct direction. Thus, we design an flexible framework to silence the contribution of noisy pixels to loss function, called Silencer. We take the nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) and deep NMF methods as examples since they are the prime models for community detection. We first prove the convergence of Silencer in NMF. Compared with existing methods, Silencer show top performance in six real-world networks with random noise, adversarial perturbation, and mixed noise. Moreover, Silencer works on random (ER), scale-free (BA), and small-world (WS) networks, and the improvement of Silencer is gradually insignificant in the order ER, BA, and WS networks.</p></details> |  |

By leveraging these APIs as functional tools, enterprises can design diverse, scenario-specific agent applications, driven by on-premise function-calling models as the core engine. However, generic models often fail to meet enterprise requirements in terms of computational efficiency, output accuracy, and stability, necessitating scenario-specific adaptation. In this paper, we propose a training pipeline for function-calling capabilities tailored to real-world business scenarios. This pipeline includes the synthesis and augmentation of scenario-specific function-calling data, model fine-tuning, and performance evaluation and analysis. Using this pipeline, we generated 1,260 fully AI-generated samples and 1,035 augmented manually-labeled samples in digital HR agent scenario. The Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct model was employed as the base model and fine-tuned using the LoRA method on four GPUs with 24GB VRAM. Our fine-tuned model demonstrated outstanding performance in evaluations and practical applications, surpassing GPT-4 and GPT-4o in accuracy on the test set. These results validate the reliability of the proposed pipeline for training scenario-specific function-calling models.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 6 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

In this case, developers rely on stack traces, i.e., series of function calls that led to the error. Since there can be tens and hundreds of thousands of them describing the same issue from different users, automatic deduplication into categories is necessary to allow for processing. Recent works have proposed powerful deep learning-based approaches for this, but they are evaluated and compared in isolation from real-life workflows, and it is not clear whether they will actually work well at scale. To overcome this gap, this work presents three main contributions: a novel model, an industry-based dataset, and a multi-faceted evaluation. Our model consists of two parts - (1) an embedding model with byte-pair encoding and approximate nearest neighbor search to quickly find the most relevant stack traces to the incoming one, and (2) a reranker that re-ranks the most fitting stack traces, taking into account the repeated frames between them. To complement the existing datasets collected from open-source projects, we share with the community SlowOps - a dataset of stack traces from IntelliJ-based products developed by JetBrains, which has an order of magnitude more stack traces per category. Finally, we carry out an evaluation that strives to be realistic: measuring not only the accuracy of categorization, but also the operation time and the ability to create new categories. The evaluation shows that our model strikes a good balance - it outperforms other models on both open-source datasets and SlowOps, while also being faster on time than most. We release all of our code and data, and hope that our work can pave the way to further practice-oriented research in the area.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at SANER'25. 11 pages, 2 figures</p></details> |
| **[Unlock the Correlation between Supervised Fine-Tuning and Reinforcement Learning in Training Code Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10305v2)** | 2024-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatic code generation has been a longstanding research topic. With the advancement of general-purpose large language models (LLMs), the ability to code stands out as one important measure to the model's reasoning performance. Usually, a two-stage training paradigm is implemented to obtain a Code LLM, namely the pretraining and the fine-tuning. Within the fine-tuning, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and reinforcement learning (RL) are often used to improve the model's zero-shot ability. A large number of work has been conducted to improve the model's performance on code-related benchmarks with either modifications to the algorithm or refinement of the dataset. However, we still lack a deep insight into the correlation between SFT and RL. For instance, what kind of dataset should be used to ensure generalization, or what if we abandon the SFT phase in fine-tuning. In this work, we make an attempt to understand the correlation between SFT and RL. To facilitate our research, we manually craft 100 basis python functions, called atomic functions, and then a synthesizing pipeline is deployed to create a large number of synthetic functions on top of the atomic ones. In this manner, we ensure that the train and test sets remain distinct, preventing data contamination. Through comprehensive ablation study, we find: (1) Both atomic and synthetic functions are indispensable for SFT's generalization, and only a handful of synthetic functions are adequate; (2) Through RL, the SFT's generalization to target domain can be greatly enhanced, even with the same training prompts; (3) Training RL from scratch can alleviate the over-fitting issue introduced in the SFT phase.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tube Loss: A Novel Approach for Prediction Interval Estimation and probabilistic forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06853v2)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a novel loss function, called 'Tube Loss', for simultaneous estimation of bounds of a Prediction Interval (PI) in the regression setup, and also for generating probabilistic forecasts from time series data solving a single optimization problem. The PIs obtained by minimizing the empirical risk based on the Tube Loss are shown to be of better quality than the PIs obtained by the existing methods in the following sense. First, it yields intervals that attain the prespecified confidence level $t \in(0,1)$ asymptotically. A theoretical proof of this fact is given. Secondly, the user is allowed to move the interval up or down by controlling the value of a parameter. This helps the user to choose a PI capturing denser regions of the probability distribution of the response variable inside the interval, and thus, sharpening its width. This is shown to be especially useful when the conditional distribution of the response variable is skewed. Further, the Tube Loss based PI estimation method can trade-off between the coverage and the average width by solving a single optimization problem. It enables further reduction of the average width of PI through re-calibration. Also, unlike a few existing PI estimation methods the gradient descent (GD) method can be used for minimization of empirical risk. Finally, through extensive experimentation, we have shown the efficacy of the Tube Loss based PI estimation in kernel machines, neural networks and deep networks and also for probabilistic forecasting tasks. The codes of the experiments are available at https://github.com/ltpritamanand/Tube_loss</p></details> |  |

However, the process can be protracted and resource-intensive, especially when confronted with extensive codebases. In this work, I present FuzzDistill, an approach that harnesses compile-time data and machine learning to refine fuzzing targets. By analyzing compile-time information, such as function call graphs' features, loop information, and memory operations, FuzzDistill identifies high-priority areas of the codebase that are more probable to contain vulnerabilities. I demonstrate the efficacy of my approach through experiments conducted on real-world software, demonstrating substantial reductions in testing time.</p></details> |  |
| **[Asynchronous LLM Function Calling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07017v1)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) use function calls to interface with external tools and data source. However, the current approach to LLM function calling is inherently synchronous, where each call blocks LLM inference, limiting LLM operation and concurrent function execution. In this work, we propose AsyncLM, a system for asynchronous LLM function calling. AsyncLM improves LLM's operational efficiency by enabling LLMs to generate and execute function calls concurrently. Instead of waiting for each call's completion, AsyncLM introduces an interrupt mechanism to asynchronously notify the LLM in-flight when function calls return. We design an in-context protocol for function calls and interrupts, provide fine-tuning strategy to adapt LLMs to the interrupt semantics, and implement these mechanisms efficiently on LLM inference process. We demonstrate that AsyncLM can reduce end-to-end task completion latency from 1.6x-5.4x compared to synchronous function calling on a set of benchmark tasks in the Berkeley function calling leaderboard (BFCL). Furthermore, we discuss how interrupt mechanisms can be extended to enable novel human-LLM or LLM-LLM interactions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Phaedrus: Exploring Dynamic Application Behavior with Lightweight Generative Models and Large-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06994v1)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Application profiling is an indispensable technique for many software development tasks, such as code optimization and memory management, where optimization decisions are tailored to specific program profiles. Unfortunately, modern applications codebases exhibit highly variant behavior across different inputs, creating challenges for conventional profiling approaches that rely on a single execution instance. In this paper, we propose \textbf{Phaedrus}, a new \textit{compiler-assisted deep learning framework} designed to predict dynamic program behaviors across varied execution scenarios, specifically focusing on dynamic function call prediction. Traditional profile-guided optimization methods struggle with the input-dependent variability of modern applications, where profiling on different inputs yields divergent application behaviors. To address this, Phaedrus proposes two new approaches: \textit{Application Profile Generalization}, which uses generative models trained on compressed and augmented \textit{Whole Program Path} (WPP) profiles to predict application behavior under unseen inputs, and \textit{Application Behavior Synthesis}, a profile-less approach where Large Language Models (LLMs) directly infer dynamic functions based on source code \& static compiler analysis, bypassing the need for traditional profiling. Our experiments show that \textit{Phaedrus} can achieve upto $10^7X$ reduction in WPP profile sizes, can predict dynamic hot functions that cover upto 85-99\% of the execution time, along with an average of \textbf{13.46\%} (upto \textbf{65\%}) reduction in application binary size reduction, without profiles.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning from Snapshots of Discrete and Continuous Data Streams](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06079v1)** | 2024-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Imagine a smart camera trap selectively clicking pictures to understand animal movement patterns within a particular habitat. These "snapshots", or pieces of data captured from a data stream at adaptively chosen times, provide a glimpse of different animal movements unfolding through time. Learning a continuous-time process through snapshots, such as smart camera traps, is a central theme governing a wide array of online learning situations. In this paper, we adopt a learning-theoretic perspective in understanding the fundamental nature of learning different classes of functions from both discrete data streams and continuous data streams. In our first framework, the \textit{update-and-deploy} setting, a learning algorithm discretely queries from a process to update a predictor designed to make predictions given as input the data stream. We construct a uniform sampling algorithm that can learn with bounded error any concept class with finite Littlestone dimension. Our second framework, known as the \emph{blind-prediction} setting, consists of a learning algorithm generating predictions independently of observing the process, only engaging with the process when it chooses to make queries. Interestingly, we show a stark contrast in learnability where non-trivial concept classes are unlearnable. However, we show that adaptive learning algorithms are necessary to learn sets of time-dependent and data-dependent functions, called pattern classes, in either framework. Finally, we develop a theory of pattern classes under discrete data streams for the blind-prediction setting.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Machine Learning-Based Approach For Detecting Malicious PyPI Packages](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05259v1)** | 2024-12-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background. In modern software development, the use of external libraries and packages is increasingly prevalent, streamlining the software development process and enabling developers to deploy feature-rich systems with little coding. While this reliance on reusing code offers substantial benefits, it also introduces serious risks for deployed software in the form of malicious packages - harmful and vulnerable code disguised as useful libraries. Aims. Popular ecosystems, such PyPI, receive thousands of new package contributions every week, and distinguishing safe contributions from harmful ones presents a significant challenge. There is a dire need for reliable methods to detect and address the presence of malicious packages in these environments. Method. To address these challenges, we propose a data-driven approach that uses machine learning and static analysis to examine the package's metadata, code, files, and textual characteristics to identify malicious packages. Results. In evaluations conducted within the PyPI ecosystem, we achieved an F1-measure of 0.94 for identifying malicious packages using a stacking ensemble classifier. Conclusions. This tool can be seamlessly integrated into package vetting pipelines and has the capability to flag entire packages, not just malicious function calls. This enhancement strengthens security measures and reduces the manual workload for developers and registry maintainers, thereby contributing to the overall integrity of the ecosystem.</p></details> |  |

Research indicates that over 40% of potential energy savings can be achieved during the early design stage. Therefore, decision-making in green building design (DGBD), which is based on modeling and performance simulation, is crucial for reducing building energy costs. However, the field of green building encompasses a broad range of specialized knowledge, which involves significant learning costs and results in low decision-making efficiency. Many studies have already applied artificial intelligence (AI) methods to this field. Based on previous research, this study innovatively integrates large language models with DGBD, creating GreenQA, a question answering framework for multimodal data reasoning. Utilizing Retrieval Augmented Generation, Chain of Thought, and Function Call methods, GreenQA enables multimodal question answering, including weather data analysis and visualization, retrieval of green building cases, and knowledge query. Additionally, this study conducted a user survey using the GreenQA web platform. The results showed that 96% of users believed the platform helped improve design efficiency. This study not only effectively supports DGBD but also provides inspiration for AI-assisted design.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at Association for Computer Aided Design in Architecture (ACADIA) 2024</p></details> |
| **[Explainable Malware Detection through Integrated Graph Reduction and Learning Techniques](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03634v1)** | 2024-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Control Flow Graphs and Function Call Graphs have become pivotal in providing a detailed understanding of program execution and effectively characterizing the behavior of malware. These graph-based representations, when combined with Graph Neural Networks (GNN), have shown promise in developing high-performance malware detectors. However, challenges remain due to the large size of these graphs and the inherent opacity in the decision-making process of GNNs. This paper addresses these issues by developing several graph reduction techniques to reduce graph size and applying the state-of-the-art GNNExplainer to enhance the interpretability of GNN outputs. The analysis demonstrates that integrating our proposed graph reduction technique along with GNNExplainer in the malware detection framework significantly reduces graph size while preserving high performance, providing an effective balance between efficiency and transparency in malware detection.</p></details> |  |

This research delves into enhancing the function-calling capabilities of LLMs by exploring different approaches, including prompt formats for integrating function descriptions, blending function-calling and instruction-following data, introducing a novel Decision Token for conditional prompts, leveraging chain-of-thought reasoning, and overcoming multilingual challenges with a translation pipeline. Our key findings and contributions are as follows: (1) Instruction-following data improves both function-calling accuracy and relevance detection. (2) The use of the newly proposed Decision Token, combined with synthetic non-function-call data, enhances relevance detection. (3) A tailored translation pipeline effectively overcomes multilingual limitations, demonstrating significant improvements in Traditional Chinese. These insights highlight the potential for improved function-calling capabilities and multilingual applications in LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Kolmogorov Superposition Theorem can Break the Curse of Dimensionality When Approximating High Dimensional Functions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.09963v5)** | 2024-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We explain how to use Kolmogorov Superposition Theorem (KST) to break the curse of dimensionality when approximating a dense class of multivariate continuous functions. We first show that there is a class of functions called Kolmogorov-Lipschitz (KL) continuous in $C([0,1]^d)$ which can be approximated by a special ReLU neural network of two hidden layers with a dimension independent approximation rate $O(1/n)$ with approximation constant increasing quadratically in $d$. The number of parameters used in such neural network approximation equals to $(6d+2)n$. Next we introduce KB-splines by using linear B-splines to replace the outer function and smooth the KB-splines to have the so-called LKB-splines as the basis for approximation. Our numerical evidence shows that the curse of dimensionality is broken in the following sense: When using the standard discrete least squares (DLS) method to approximate a continuous function, there exists a pivotal set of points in $[0,1]^d$ with size at most $O(nd)$ such that the rooted mean squares error (RMSE) from the DLS based on the pivotal set is similar to the RMSE of the DLS based on the original set with size $O(n^d)$. The pivotal point set is chosen by using matrix cross approximation technique and the number of LKB-splines used for approximation is the same as the size of the pivotal data set. Therefore, we do not need too many basis functions as well as too many function values to approximate a high dimensional continuous function $f$.</p></details> |  |
| **[XGrammar: Flexible and Efficient Structured Generation Engine for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15100v2)** | 2024-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The applications of LLM Agents are becoming increasingly complex and diverse, leading to a high demand for structured outputs that can be parsed into code, structured function calls, and embodied agent commands. These developments bring significant demands for structured generation in LLM inference. Context-free grammar is a flexible approach to enable structured generation via constrained decoding. However, executing context-free grammar requires going through several stack states over all tokens in vocabulary during runtime, bringing non-negligible overhead for structured generation. In this paper, we propose XGrammar, a flexible and efficient structure generation engine for large language models. XGrammar accelerates context-free grammar execution by dividing the vocabulary into context-independent tokens that can be prechecked and context-dependent tokens that need to be interpreted during runtime. We further build transformations to expand the grammar context and reduce the number of context-independent tokens. Additionally, we build an efficient persistent stack to accelerate the context-dependent token checks. Finally, we co-design the grammar engine with LLM inference engine to overlap grammar computation with GPU executions. Evaluation results show that XGrammar can achieve up to 100x speedup over existing solutions. Combined with an LLM inference engine, it can generate near-zero overhead structure generation in end-to-end low-LLM serving.</p></details> |  |

A deeper understanding of brain functionality will lead to the development of novel deep neural networks. In this work, we introduce a novel framework named Brainformer, a straightforward yet effective Transformer-based framework, to analyze Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) patterns in the human perception system from a machine-learning perspective. Specifically, we present the Multi-scale fMRI Transformer to explore brain activity patterns through fMRI signals. This architecture includes a simple yet efficient module for high-dimensional fMRI signal encoding and incorporates a novel embedding technique called 3D Voxels Embedding. Secondly, drawing inspiration from the functionality of the brain's Region of Interest, we introduce a novel loss function called Brain fMRI Guidance Loss. This loss function mimics brain activity patterns from these regions in the deep neural network using fMRI data. This work introduces a prospective approach to transferring knowledge from human perception to neural networks. Our experiments demonstrate that leveraging fMRI information allows the machine vision model to achieve results comparable to State-of-the-Art methods in various image recognition tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tracing Optimization for Performance Modeling and Regression Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17548v1)** | 2024-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software performance modeling plays a crucial role in developing and maintaining software systems. A performance model analytically describes the relationship between the performance of a system and its runtime activities. This process typically examines various aspects of a system's runtime behavior, such as the execution frequency of functions or methods, to forecast performance metrics like program execution time. By using performance models, developers can predict expected performance and thereby effectively identify and address unexpected performance regressions when actual performance deviates from the model's predictions. One common and precise method for capturing performance behavior is software tracing, which involves instrumenting the execution of a program, either at the kernel level (e.g., system calls) or application level (e.g., function calls). However, due to the nature of tracing, it can be highly resource-intensive, making it impractical for production environments where resources are limited. In this work, we propose statistical approaches to reduce tracing overhead by identifying and excluding performance-insensitive code regions, particularly application-level functions, from tracing while still building accurate performance models that can capture performance degradations. By selecting an optimal set of functions to be traced, we can construct optimized performance models that achieve an R-2 score of up to 99% and, sometimes, outperform full tracing models (models using non-optimized tracing data), while significantly reducing the tracing overhead by more than 80% in most cases. Our optimized performance models can also capture performance regressions in our studied programs effectively, demonstrating their usefulness in real-world scenarios. Our approach is fully automated, making it ready to be used in production environments with minimal human effort.</p></details> |  |

To unveil the inner workings of modern neural architectures, a recent work \cite{yu2024white} proposed an information-theoretic objective function called Sparse Rate Reduction (SRR) and interpreted its unrolled optimization as a Transformer-like model called Coding Rate Reduction Transformer (CRATE). However, the focus of the study was primarily on the basic implementation, and whether this objective is optimized in practice and its causal relationship to generalization remain elusive. Going beyond this study, we derive different implementations by analyzing layer-wise behaviors of CRATE, both theoretically and empirically. To reveal the predictive power of SRR on generalization, we collect a set of model variants induced by varied implementations and hyperparameters and evaluate SRR as a complexity measure based on its correlation with generalization. Surprisingly, we find out that SRR has a positive correlation coefficient and outperforms other baseline measures, such as path-norm and sharpness-based ones. Furthermore, we show that generalization can be improved using SRR as regularization on benchmark image classification datasets. We hope this paper can shed light on leveraging SRR to design principled models and study their generalization ability.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2024 |

Currently, existing models are typically based on either internal code semantics or a combination of function call graphs (CG) and internal code semantics. However, these models have limitations. Internal code semantic models only consider the semantics within the function, ignoring the inter-function semantics, making it difficult to handle situations such as function inlining. The combination of CG and internal code semantics is insufficient for addressing complex real-world scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose BinEnhance, a novel framework designed to leverage the inter-function semantics to enhance the expression of internal code semantics for binary code search. Specifically, BinEnhance constructs an External Environment Semantic Graph (EESG), which establishes a stable and analogous external environment for homologous functions by using different inter-function semantic relations (e.g., call, location, data-co-use). After the construction of EESG, we utilize the embeddings generated by existing internal code semantic models to initialize nodes of EESG. Finally, we design a Semantic Enhancement Model (SEM) that uses Relational Graph Convolutional Networks (RGCNs) and a residual block to learn valuable external semantics on the EESG for generating the enhanced semantics embedding. In addition, BinEnhance utilizes data feature similarity to refine the cosine similarity of semantic embeddings. We conduct experiments under six different tasks (e.g., under function inlining scenario) and the results illustrate the performance and robustness of BinEnhance. The application of BinEnhance to HermesSim, Asm2vec, TREX, Gemini, and Asteria on two public datasets results in an improvement of Mean Average Precision (MAP) from 53.6% to 69.7%. Moreover, the efficiency increases fourfold.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Network and Distributed System Security (NDSS) Symposium 2025 fall cycle</p></details> |

However, despite with intrinsic world knowledge, their application on structured tabular data prediction still lags behind, primarily due to the numerical insensitivity and modality discrepancy that brings a gap between LLM reasoning and statistical tabular learning. Unlike textual or vision data (e.g., electronic clinical notes or medical imaging data), tabular data is often presented in heterogeneous numerical values (e.g., CBC reports). This ubiquitous data format requires intensive expert annotation, and its numerical nature limits LLMs' capability to effectively transfer untapped domain expertise. In this paper, we propose SERSAL, a general self-prompting method by synergy learning with small models to enhance LLM tabular prediction in an unsupervised manner. Specifically, SERSAL utilizes the LLM's prior outcomes as original soft noisy annotations, which are dynamically leveraged to teach a better small student model. Reversely, the outcomes from the trained small model are used to teach the LLM to further refine its real capability. This process can be repeatedly applied to gradually distill refined knowledge for continuous progress. Comprehensive experiments on widely used medical domain tabular datasets show that, without access to gold labels, applying SERSAL to OpenAI GPT reasoning process attains substantial improvement compared to linguistic prompting methods, which serves as an orthogonal direction for tabular LLM, and increasing prompting bonus is observed as more powerful LLMs appear.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025.

In this work, we address this concern for tabular data. Specifically, we introduce a variety of different techniques to assess whether a language model has seen a tabular dataset during training. This investigation reveals that LLMs have memorized many popular tabular datasets verbatim. We then compare the few-shot learning performance of LLMs on datasets that were seen during training to the performance on datasets released after training. We find that LLMs perform better on datasets seen during training, indicating that memorization leads to overfitting. At the same time, LLMs show non-trivial performance on novel datasets and are surprisingly robust to data transformations. We then investigate the in-context statistical learning abilities of LLMs. While LLMs are significantly better than random at solving statistical classification problems, the sample efficiency of few-shot learning lags behind traditional statistical learning algorithms, especially as the dimension of the problem increases. This suggests that much of the observed few-shot performance on novel real-world datasets is due to the LLM's world knowledge. Overall, our results highlight the importance of testing whether an LLM has seen an evaluation dataset during pre-training. We release the https://github.com/interpretml/LLM-Tabular-Memorization-Checker Python package to test LLMs for memorization of tabular datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>COLM ...</summary><p>COLM camera ready, fix typo</p></details> |

Since it is impossible to generalize to a completely new and unknown domain, we study models that are easy to adapt to the target domain even with few labeled examples. We focus on building more informative representations of tabular data that can mitigate $Y|X$-shifts, and propose to leverage the prior world knowledge in LLMs by serializing (write down) the tabular data to encode it. We find LLM embeddings alone provide inconsistent improvements in robustness, but models trained on them can be well adapted/finetuned to the target domain even using 32 labeled observations. Our finding is based on a comprehensive and systematic study consisting of 7650 source-target pairs and benchmark against 261,000 model configurations trained by 22 algorithms. Our observation holds when ablating the size of accessible target data and different adaptation strategies. The code is available at https://github.com/namkoong-lab/LLM-Tabular-Shifts.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we address this concern for tabular data. Starting with simple qualitative tests for whether an LLM knows the names and values of features, we introduce a variety of different techniques to assess the degrees of contamination, including statistical tests for conditional distribution modeling and four tests that identify memorization. Our investigation reveals that LLMs are pre-trained on many popular tabular datasets. This exposure can lead to invalid performance evaluation on downstream tasks because the LLMs have, in effect, been fit to the test set. Interestingly, we also identify a regime where the language model reproduces important statistics of the data, but fails to reproduce the dataset verbatim. On these datasets, although seen during training, good performance on downstream tasks might not be due to overfitting. Our findings underscore the need for ensuring data integrity in machine learning tasks with LLMs. To facilitate future research, we release an open-source tool that can perform various tests for memorization \url{https://github.com/interpretml/LLM-Tabular-Memorization-Checker}.</p></details> | <details><summary>Table...</summary><p>Table Representation Learning Workshop at NeurIPS 2023</p></details> |
