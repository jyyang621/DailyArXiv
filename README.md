| **[Speaking at the Right Level: Literacy-Controlled Counterspeech Generation with RAG-RL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01058v3)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Health misinformation spreading online poses a significant threat to public health. Researchers have explored methods for automatically generating counterspeech to health misinformation as a mitigation strategy. Existing approaches often produce uniform responses, ignoring that the health literacy level of the audience could affect the accessibility and effectiveness of counterspeech. We propose a Controlled-Literacy framework using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with reinforcement learning (RL) to generate tailored counterspeech adapted to different health literacy levels. In particular, we retrieve knowledge aligned with specific health literacy levels, enabling accessible and factual information to support generation. We design a reward function incorporating subjective user preferences and objective readability-based rewards to optimize counterspeech to the target health literacy level. Experiment results show that Controlled-Literacy outperforms baselines by generating more accessible and user-preferred counterspeech. This research contributes to more equitable and impactful public health communication by improving the accessibility and comprehension of counterspeech to health misinformation</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Findings of EMNLP 2025</p></details> |
| **[Turk-LettuceDetect: A Hallucination Detection Models for Turkish RAG Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17671v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) has been hindered by their tendency to hallucinate, generating plausible but factually incorrect information. While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems attempt to address this issue by grounding responses in external knowledge, hallucination remains a persistent challenge, particularly for morphologically complex, low-resource languages like Turkish. This paper introduces Turk-LettuceDetect, the first suite of hallucination detection models specifically designed for Turkish RAG applications. Building on the LettuceDetect framework, we formulate hallucination detection as a token-level classification task and fine-tune three distinct encoder architectures: a Turkish-specific ModernBERT, TurkEmbed4STS, and multilingual EuroBERT. These models were trained on a machine-translated version of the RAGTruth benchmark dataset containing 17,790 instances across question answering, data-to-text generation, and summarization tasks. Our experimental results show that the ModernBERT-based model achieves an F1-score of 0.7266 on the complete test set, with particularly strong performance on structured tasks. The models maintain computational efficiency while supporting long contexts up to 8,192 tokens, making them suitable for real-time deployment. Comparative analysis reveals that while state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate high recall, they suffer from low precision due to over-generation of hallucinated content, underscoring the necessity of specialized detection mechanisms. By releasing our models and translated dataset, this work addresses a critical gap in multilingual NLP and establishes a foundation for developing more reliable and trustworthy AI applications for Turkish and other languages.</p></details> |  |
| **[UR$^2$: Unify RAG and Reasoning through Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06165v3)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities through two complementary paradigms: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which enhances knowledge grounding, and Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), which optimizes complex reasoning abilities. However, these two capabilities are often developed in isolation, and existing efforts to unify them remain narrow in scope -- typically limited to open-domain QA with fixed retrieval settings and task-specific constraints. This lack of integration constrains generalization and limits the applicability of RAG-RL methods to broader domains. To bridge this gap, we propose UR2 (Unified RAG and Reasoning), a general framework that unifies retrieval and reasoning through reinforcement learning. UR2 introduces two key contributions: a difficulty-aware curriculum training that selectively invokes retrieval only for challenging problems, and a hybrid knowledge access strategy combining domain-specific offline corpora with LLM-generated summaries. These components are designed to enable dynamic coordination between retrieval and reasoning, improving adaptability across a diverse range of tasks. Experiments across open-domain QA, MMLU-Pro, medical, and mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrate that UR$^2$ (built on Qwen-2.5-3/7B and LLaMA-3.1-8B) significantly outperforms existing RAG and RL methods, achieving comparable performance to GPT-4o-mini and GPT-4.1-mini on several benchmarks. We have released all code, models, and data at https://github.com/Tsinghua-dhy/UR2.</p></details> |  |
| **[EviNote-RAG: Enhancing RAG Models via Answer-Supportive Evidence Notes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00877v2)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has advanced open-domain question answering by incorporating external information into model reasoning. However, effectively leveraging external information to enhance reasoning presents the following challenges: (1) low signal-to-noise ratio, where answer-supportive external information is diluted by irrelevant material, and (2) error accumulation, which arises in multi-hop reasoning when incomplete or misleading information is incorporated. To address these challenges, we introduce EviNote-RAG, a framework that follows a retrieve-note-answer workflow. Instead of reasoning directly over raw external information, the model first produces Supportive-Evidence Notes (SENs), which concisely preserve answer-critical information and explicitly mark key and uncertainty information to improve accuracy. We further design an entailment-based Evidence Quality Reward (EQR) to ensure that SENs are logically sufficient to derive the final answer, thereby enhancing SENs' quality. Experiments on both in-domain and out-of-domain QA benchmarks show that EviNote-RAG achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving answer accuracy, training stability, robustness, and efficiency. In particular, it yields relative F1 gains of 20% on HotpotQA (+0.093), 40% on Bamboogle (+0.151), and 91% on 2Wiki (+0.256), benefiting from improvements in the reasoning process.</p></details> |  |
| **[Agentic AI with Orchestrator-Agent Trust: A Modular Visual Classification Framework with Trust-Aware Orchestration and RAG-Based Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10571v3)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern Artificial Intelligence (AI) increasingly relies on multi-agent architectures that blend visual and language understanding. Yet, a pressing challenge remains: How can we trust these agents especially in zero-shot settings with no fine-tuning? We introduce a novel modular Agentic AI visual classification framework that integrates generalist multimodal agents with a non-visual reasoning orchestrator and a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) module. Applied to apple leaf disease diagnosis, we benchmark three configurations: (I) zero-shot with confidence-based orchestration, (II) fine-tuned agents with improved performance, and (III) trust-calibrated orchestration enhanced by CLIP-based image retrieval and re-evaluation loops. Using confidence calibration metrics (ECE, OCR, CCC), the orchestrator modulates trust across agents. Our results demonstrate a 77.94\% accuracy improvement in the zero-shot setting using trust-aware orchestration and RAG, achieving 85.63\% overall. GPT-4o showed better calibration, while Qwen-2.5-VL displayed overconfidence. Furthermore, image-RAG grounded predictions with visually similar cases, enabling correction of agent overconfidence via iterative re-evaluation. The proposed system separates perception (vision agents) from meta-reasoning (orchestrator), enabling scalable and interpretable multi-agent AI. This blueprint illustrates how Agentic AI can deliver trustworthy, modular, and transparent reasoning, and is extensible to diagnostics, biology, and other trust-critical domains. In doing so, we highlight Agentic AI not just as an architecture but as a paradigm for building reliable multi-agent intelligence. agentic ai, orchestrator agent trust, trust orchestration, visual classification, retrieval augmented reasoning</p></details> |  |
| **[Comparing RAG and GraphRAG for Page-Level Retrieval Question Answering on Math Textbook](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16780v1)** | 2025-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Technology-enhanced learning environments often help students retrieve relevant learning content for questions arising during self-paced study. Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as novel aids for information retrieval during learning. While LLMs are effective for general-purpose question-answering, they typically lack alignment with the domain knowledge of specific course materials such as textbooks and slides. We investigate Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and GraphRAG, a knowledge graph-enhanced RAG approach, for page-level question answering in an undergraduate mathematics textbook. While RAG has been effective for retrieving discrete, contextually relevant passages, GraphRAG may excel in modeling interconnected concepts and hierarchical knowledge structures. We curate a dataset of 477 question-answer pairs, each tied to a distinct textbook page. We then compare the standard embedding-based RAG methods to GraphRAG for evaluating both retrieval accuracy-whether the correct page is retrieved-and generated answer quality via F1 scores. Our findings show that embedding-based RAG achieves higher retrieval accuracy and better F1 scores compared to GraphRAG, which tends to retrieve excessive and sometimes irrelevant content due to its entity-based structure. We also explored re-ranking the retrieved pages with LLM and observed mixed results, including performance drop and hallucinations when dealing with larger context windows. Overall, this study highlights both the promises and challenges of page-level retrieval systems in educational contexts, emphasizing the need for more refined retrieval methods to build reliable AI tutoring solutions in providing reference page numbers.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Financial RAG with Agentic AI and Multi-HyDE: A Novel Approach to Knowledge Retrieval and Hallucination Reduction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16369v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate and reliable knowledge retrieval is vital for financial question-answering, where continually updated data sources and complex, high-stakes contexts demand precision. Traditional retrieval systems rely on a single database and retriever, but financial applications require more sophisticated approaches to handle intricate regulatory filings, market analyses, and extensive multi-year reports. We introduce a framework for financial Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) that leverages agentic AI and the Multi-HyDE system, an approach that generates multiple, nonequivalent queries to boost the effectiveness and coverage of retrieval from large, structured financial corpora. Our pipeline is optimized for token efficiency and multi-step financial reasoning, and we demonstrate that their combination improves accuracy by 11.2% and reduces hallucinations by 15%. Our method is evaluated on standard financial QA benchmarks, showing that integrating domain-specific retrieval mechanisms such as Multi-HyDE with robust toolsets, including keyword and table-based retrieval, significantly enhances both the accuracy and reliability of answers. This research not only delivers a modular, adaptable retrieval framework for finance but also highlights the importance of structured agent workflows and multi-perspective retrieval for trustworthy deployment of AI in high-stakes financial applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 Pa...</summary><p>14 Pages, 8 Tables, 2 Figures.

| **[ConfReady: A RAG based Assistant and Dataset for Conference Checklist Responses](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04675v2)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ARR Responsible NLP Research checklist website states that the "checklist is designed to encourage best practices for responsible research, addressing issues of research ethics, societal impact and reproducibility." Answering the questions is an opportunity for authors to reflect on their work and make sure any shared scientific assets follow best practices. Ideally, considering a checklist before submission can favorably impact the writing of a research paper. However, previous research has shown that self-reported checklist responses don't always accurately represent papers. In this work, we introduce ConfReady, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) application that can be used to empower authors to reflect on their work and assist authors with conference checklists. To evaluate checklist assistants, we curate a dataset of 1,975 ACL checklist responses, analyze problems in human answers, and benchmark RAG and Large Language Model (LM) based systems on an evaluation subset. Our code is released under the AGPL-3.0 license on GitHub, with documentation covering the user interface and PyPI package.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP 2025 Demo</p></details> |
| **[Engineering RAG Systems for Real-World Applications: Design, Development, and Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20869v2)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems are emerging as a key approach for grounding Large Language Models (LLMs) in external knowledge, addressing limitations in factual accuracy and contextual relevance. However, there is a lack of empirical studies that report on the development of RAG-based implementations grounded in real-world use cases, evaluated through general user involvement, and accompanied by systematic documentation of lessons learned. This paper presents five domain-specific RAG applications developed for real-world scenarios across governance, cybersecurity, agriculture, industrial research, and medical diagnostics. Each system incorporates multilingual OCR, semantic retrieval via vector embeddings, and domain-adapted LLMs, deployed through local servers or cloud APIs to meet distinct user needs. A web-based evaluation involving a total of 100 participants assessed the systems across six dimensions: (i) Ease of Use, (ii) Relevance, (iii) Transparency, (iv) Responsiveness, (v) Accuracy, and (vi) Likelihood of Recommendation. Based on user feedback and our development experience, we documented twelve key lessons learned, highlighting technical, operational, and ethical challenges affecting the reliability and usability of RAG systems in practice.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the Proceedings of the 51st Euromicro Conference on Software Engineering and Advanced Applications, SEAA 2025.

| **[Causal-Counterfactual RAG: The Integration of Causal-Counterfactual Reasoning into RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14435v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have transformed natural language processing (NLP), enabling diverse applications by integrating large-scale pre-trained knowledge. However, their static knowledge limits dynamic reasoning over external information, especially in knowledge-intensive domains. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this challenge by combining retrieval mechanisms with generative modeling to improve contextual understanding. Traditional RAG systems suffer from disrupted contextual integrity due to text chunking and over-reliance on semantic similarity for retrieval, often resulting in shallow and less accurate responses. We propose Causal-Counterfactual RAG, a novel framework that integrates explicit causal graphs representing cause-effect relationships into the retrieval process and incorporates counterfactual reasoning grounded on the causal structure. Unlike conventional methods, our framework evaluates not only direct causal evidence but also the counterfactuality of associated causes, combining results from both to generate more robust, accurate, and interpretable answers. By leveraging causal pathways and associated hypothetical scenarios, Causal-Counterfactual RAG preserves contextual coherence, reduces hallucination, and enhances reasoning fidelity.</p></details> |  |
| **[TAI Scan Tool: A RAG-Based Tool With Minimalistic Input for Trustworthy AI Self-Assessment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17514v2)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces the TAI Scan Tool, a RAG-based TAI self-assessment tool with minimalistic input. The current version of the tool supports the legal TAI assessment, with a particular emphasis on facilitating compliance with the AI Act. It involves a two-step approach with a pre-screening and an assessment phase. The assessment output of the system includes insight regarding the risk-level of the AI system according to the AI Act, while at the same time retrieving relevant articles to aid with compliance and notify on their obligations. Our qualitative evaluation using use-case scenarios yields promising results, correctly predicting risk levels while retrieving relevant articles across three distinct semantic groups. Furthermore, interpretation of results shows that the tool's reasoning relies on comparison with the setting of high-risk systems, a behaviour attributed to their deployment requiring careful consideration, and therefore frequently presented within the AI Act.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 1 figure, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[Clue-RAG: Towards Accurate and Cost-Efficient Graph-based RAG via Multi-Partite Graph and Query-Driven Iterative Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08445v3)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the remarkable progress of Large Language Models (LLMs), their performance in question answering (QA) remains limited by the lack of domain-specific and up-to-date knowledge. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this limitation by incorporating external information, often from graph-structured data. However, existing graph-based RAG methods suffer from poor graph quality due to incomplete extraction and insufficient utilization of query information during retrieval. To overcome these limitations, we propose Clue-RAG, a novel approach that introduces (1) a multi-partite graph index incorporates Chunk, knowledge unit, and entity to capture semantic content at multiple levels of granularity, coupled with a hybrid extraction strategy that reduces LLM token usage while still producing accurate and disambiguated knowledge units, and (2) Q-Iter, a query-driven iterative retrieval strategy that enhances relevance through semantic search and constrained graph traversal. Experiments on three QA benchmarks show that Clue-RAG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to 99.33% higher Accuracy and 113.51% higher F1 score while reducing indexing costs by 72.58%. Remarkably, Clue-RAG matches or outperforms baselines even without using an LLM for indexing. These results demonstrate the effectiveness and cost-efficiency of Clue-RAG in advancing graph-based RAG systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[RAGs to Riches: RAG-like Few-shot Learning for Large Language Model Role-playing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12168v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Role-playing Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-stakes domains such as healthcare, education, and governance, where failures can directly impact user trust and well-being. A cost effective paradigm for LLM role-playing is few-shot learning, but existing approaches often cause models to break character in unexpected and potentially harmful ways, especially when interacting with hostile users. Inspired by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), we reformulate LLM role-playing into a text retrieval problem and propose a new prompting framework called RAGs-to-Riches, which leverages curated reference demonstrations to condition LLM responses. We evaluate our framework with LLM-as-a-judge preference voting and introduce two novel token-level ROUGE metrics: Intersection over Output (IOO) to quantity how much an LLM improvises and Intersection over References (IOR) to measure few-shot demonstrations utilization rate during the evaluation tasks. When simulating interactions with a hostile user, our prompting strategy incorporates in its responses during inference an average of 35% more tokens from the reference demonstrations. As a result, across 453 role-playing interactions, our models are consistently judged as being more authentic, and remain in-character more often than zero-shot and in-context Learning (ICL) methods. Our method presents a scalable strategy for building robust, human-aligned LLM role-playing frameworks.</p></details> |  |

| **[First RAG, Second SEG: A Training-Free Paradigm for Camouflaged Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15313v2)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Camouflaged object detection (COD) poses a significant challenge in computer vision due to the high similarity between objects and their backgrounds. Existing approaches often rely on heavy training and large computational resources. While foundation models such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM) offer strong generalization, they still struggle to handle COD tasks without fine-tuning and require high-quality prompts to yield good performance. However, generating such prompts manually is costly and inefficient. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{First RAG, Second SEG (RAG-SEG)}, a training-free paradigm that decouples COD into two stages: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for generating coarse masks as prompts, followed by SAM-based segmentation (SEG) for refinement. RAG-SEG constructs a compact retrieval database via unsupervised clustering, enabling fast and effective feature retrieval. During inference, the retrieved features produce pseudo-labels that guide precise mask generation using SAM2. Our method eliminates the need for conventional training while maintaining competitive performance. Extensive experiments on benchmark COD datasets demonstrate that RAG-SEG performs on par with or surpasses state-of-the-art methods. Notably, all experiments are conducted on a \textbf{personal laptop}, highlighting the computational efficiency and practicality of our approach. We present further analysis in the Appendix, covering limitations, salient object detection extension, and possible improvements. \textcolor{blue} {Code: https://github.com/Lwt-diamond/RAG-SEG.}</p></details> |  |
| **[GeoGPT-RAG Technical Report](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09686v2)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>GeoGPT is an open large language model system built to advance research in the geosciences. To enhance its domain-specific capabilities, we integrated Retrieval Augmented Generation(RAG), which augments model outputs with relevant information retrieved from an external knowledge source. GeoGPT uses RAG to draw from the GeoGPT Library, a specialized corpus curated for geoscientific content, enabling it to generate accurate, context-specific answers. Users can also create personalized knowledge bases by uploading their own publication lists, allowing GeoGPT to retrieve and respond using user-provided materials. To further improve retrieval quality and domain alignment, we fine-tuned both the embedding model and a ranking model that scores retrieved passages by relevance to the query. These enhancements optimize RAG for geoscience applications and significantly improve the system's ability to deliver precise and trustworthy outputs. GeoGPT reflects a strong commitment to open science through its emphasis on collaboration, transparency, and community driven development. As part of this commitment, we have open-sourced two core RAG components-GeoEmbedding and GeoReranker-to support geoscientists, researchers, and professionals worldwide with powerful, accessible AI tools.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 10 figures, 10 tables</p></details> |
| **[An Ontology-Driven Graph RAG for Legal Norms: A Structural, Temporal, and Deterministic Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00039v5)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems in the legal domain face a critical challenge: standard, flat-text retrieval is blind to the hierarchical, diachronic, and causal structure of law, leading to anachronistic and unreliable answers. This paper introduces the Structure-Aware Temporal Graph RAG (SAT-Graph RAG), an ontology-driven framework designed to overcome these limitations by explicitly modeling the formal structure and diachronic nature of legal norms. We ground our knowledge graph in a formal, LRMoo-inspired model that distinguishes abstract legal Works from their versioned Expressions. We model temporal states as efficient aggregations that reuse the versioned expressions (CTVs) of unchanged components, and we reify legislative events as first-class Action nodes to make causality explicit and queryable. This structured backbone enables a unified, planner-guided query strategy that applies explicit policies to deterministically resolve complex requests for (i) point-in-time retrieval, (ii) hierarchical impact analysis, and (iii) auditable provenance reconstruction. Through a case study on the Brazilian Constitution, we demonstrate how this approach provides a verifiable, temporally-correct substrate for LLMs, enabling higher-order analytical capabilities while drastically reducing the risk of factual errors. The result is a practical framework for building more trustworthy and explainable legal AI systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Major...</summary><p>Major revision for clarity and academic precision.

| **[MetaRAG: Metamorphic Testing for Hallucination Detection in RAG Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09360v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in enterprise applications, yet their reliability remains limited by hallucinations, i.e., confident but factually incorrect information. Existing detection approaches, such as SelfCheckGPT and MetaQA, primarily target standalone LLMs and do not address the unique challenges of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, where responses must be consistent with retrieved evidence. We therefore present MetaRAG, a metamorphic testing framework for hallucination detection in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. MetaRAG operates in a real-time, unsupervised, black-box setting, requiring neither ground-truth references nor access to model internals, making it suitable for proprietary and high-stakes domains. The framework proceeds in four stages: (1) decompose answers into atomic factoids, (2) generate controlled mutations of each factoid using synonym and antonym substitutions, (3) verify each variant against the retrieved context (synonyms are expected to be entailed and antonyms contradicted), and (4) aggregate penalties for inconsistencies into a response-level hallucination score. Crucially for identity-aware AI, MetaRAG localizes unsupported claims at the factoid span where they occur (e.g., pregnancy-specific precautions, LGBTQ+ refugee rights, or labor eligibility), allowing users to see flagged spans and enabling system designers to configure thresholds and guardrails for identity-sensitive queries. Experiments on a proprietary enterprise dataset illustrate the effectiveness of MetaRAG for detecting hallucinations and enabling trustworthy deployment of RAG-based conversational agents. We also outline a topic-based deployment design that translates MetaRAG's span-level scores into identity-aware safeguards; this design is discussed but not evaluated in our experiments.</p></details> | under review |
| **[Automated Evidence Extraction and Scoring for Corporate Climate Policy Engagement: A Multilingual RAG Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08907v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>InfluenceMap's LobbyMap Platform monitors the climate policy engagement of over 500 companies and 250 industry associations, assessing each entity's support or opposition to science-based policy pathways for achieving the Paris Agreement's goal of limiting global warming to 1.5{\deg}C. Although InfluenceMap has made progress with automating key elements of the analytical workflow, a significant portion of the assessment remains manual, making it time- and labor-intensive and susceptible to human error. We propose an AI-assisted framework to accelerate the monitoring of corporate climate policy engagement by leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation to automate the most time-intensive extraction of relevant evidence from large-scale textual data. Our evaluation shows that a combination of layout-aware parsing, the Nomic embedding model, and few-shot prompting strategies yields the best performance in extracting and classifying evidence from multilingual corporate documents. We conclude that while the automated RAG system effectively accelerates evidence extraction, the nuanced nature of the analysis necessitates a human-in-the-loop approach where the technology augments, rather than replaces, expert judgment to ensure accuracy.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we explore how large language models (LLMs) can be used for information retrieval (IR), and an ensemble of zero-shot models can accomplish state-of-the-art performance on a domain-specific Yes/No QA task. Evaluating our approach on the BioASQ challenge tasks, we show that ensembles can outperform individual LLMs and in some cases rival or surpass domain-tuned systems - all while preserving generalizability and avoiding the need for costly fine-tuning or labeled data. Our method aggregates outputs from multiple LLM variants, including models from Anthropic and Google, to synthesize more accurate and robust answers. Moreover, our investigation highlights a relationship between context length and performance: while expanded contexts are meant to provide valuable evidence, they simultaneously risk information dilution and model disorientation. These findings emphasize IR as a critical foundation in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approaches for biomedical QA systems. Precise, focused retrieval remains essential for ensuring LLMs operate within relevant information boundaries when generating answers from retrieved documents. Our results establish that ensemble-based zero-shot approaches, when paired with effective RAG pipelines, constitute a practical and scalable alternative to domain-tuned systems for biomedical question answering.</p></details> | CEUR-WS, CLEF2025 |

This capability is especially critical in the legal domain. In this work, we introduce a novel end-to-end RAG pipeline that improves upon previous baselines using three targeted enhancements: (i) a context-aware query translator that disentangles document references from natural-language questions and adapts retrieval depth and response style based on expertise and specificity, (ii) open-source retrieval strategies using SBERT and GTE embeddings that achieve substantial performance gains while remaining cost-efficient, and (iii) a comprehensive evaluation and generation framework that combines RAGAS, BERTScore-F1, and ROUGE-Recall to assess semantic alignment and faithfulness across models and prompt designs. Our results show that carefully designed open-source pipelines can rival proprietary approaches in retrieval quality, while a custom legal-grounded prompt consistently produces more faithful and contextually relevant answers than baseline prompting. Taken together, these contributions demonstrate the potential of task-aware, component-level tuning to deliver legally grounded, reproducible, and cost-effective RAG systems for legal research assistance.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to NLLP 2025 Workshop</p></details> |

Yet, no prior work has explored knowledge base question answering over visual document images with queries provided directly in speech. We propose TextlessRAG, the first end-to-end framework for speech-based question answering over large-scale document images. Unlike prior methods, TextlessRAG eliminates ASR, TTS and OCR, directly interpreting speech, retrieving relevant visual knowledge, and generating answers in a fully textless pipeline. To further boost performance, we integrate a layout-aware reranking mechanism to refine retrieval. Experiments demonstrate substantial improvements in both efficiency and accuracy. To advance research in this direction, we also release the first bilingual speech--document RAG dataset, featuring Chinese and English voice queries paired with multimodal document content. Both the dataset and our pipeline will be made available at repository:https://github.com/xiepeijinhit-hue/textlessrag</p></details> | 5 pages, 4 figures, |
| **[CyberRAG: An Agentic RAG cyber attack classification and reporting tool](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02424v2)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS) in large enterprises can generate hundreds of thousands of alerts per hour, overwhelming analysts with logs requiring rapidly evolving expertise. Conventional machine-learning detectors reduce alert volume but still yield many false positives, while standard Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines often retrieve irrelevant context and fail to justify predictions. We present CyberRAG, a modular agent-based RAG framework that delivers real-time classification, explanation, and structured reporting for cyber-attacks. A central LLM agent orchestrates: (i) fine-tuned classifiers specialized by attack family; (ii) tool adapters for enrichment and alerting; and (iii) an iterative retrieval-and-reason loop that queries a domain-specific knowledge base until evidence is relevant and self-consistent. Unlike traditional RAG, CyberRAG adopts an agentic design that enables dynamic control flow and adaptive reasoning. This architecture autonomously refines threat labels and natural-language justifications, reducing false positives and enhancing interpretability. It is also extensible: new attack types can be supported by adding classifiers without retraining the core agent. CyberRAG was evaluated on SQL Injection, XSS, and SSTI, achieving over 94\% accuracy per class and a final classification accuracy of 94.92\% through semantic orchestration. Generated explanations reached 0.94 in BERTScore and 4.9/5 in GPT-4-based expert evaluation, with robustness preserved against adversarial and unseen payloads. These results show that agentic, specialist-oriented RAG can combine high detection accuracy with trustworthy, SOC-ready prose, offering a flexible path toward partially automated cyber-defense workflows.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Iterative LLM Framework for SIBT utilizing RAG-based Adaptive Weight Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08407v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Seed implant brachytherapy (SIBT) is an effective cancer treatment modality; however, clinical planning often relies on manual adjustment of objective function weights, leading to inefficiencies and suboptimal results. This study proposes an adaptive weight optimization framework for SIBT planning, driven by large language models (LLMs). A locally deployed DeepSeek-R1 LLM is integrated with an automatic planning algorithm in an iterative loop. Starting with fixed weights, the LLM evaluates plan quality and recommends new weights in the next iteration. This process continues until convergence criteria are met, after which the LLM conducts a comprehensive evaluation to identify the optimal plan. A clinical knowledge base, constructed and queried via retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), enhances the model's domain-specific reasoning. The proposed method was validated on 23 patient cases, showing that the LLM-assisted approach produces plans that are comparable to or exceeding clinically approved and fixed-weight plans, in terms of dose homogeneity for the clinical target volume (CTV) and sparing of organs at risk (OARs). The study demonstrates the potential use of LLMs in SIBT planning automation.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Multimodal RAG Framework for Housing Damage Assessment: Collaborative Optimization of Image Encoding and Policy Vector Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09721v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>After natural disasters, accurate evaluations of damage to housing are important for insurance claims response and planning of resources. In this work, we introduce a novel multimodal retrieval-augmented generation (MM-RAG) framework. On top of classical RAG architecture, we further the framework to devise a two-branch multimodal encoder structure that the image branch employs a visual encoder composed of ResNet and Transformer to extract the characteristic of building damage after disaster, and the text branch harnesses a BERT retriever for the text vectorization of posts as well as insurance policies and for the construction of a retrievable restoration index. To impose cross-modal semantic alignment, the model integrates a cross-modal interaction module to bridge the semantic representation between image and text via multi-head attention. Meanwhile, in the generation module, the introduced modal attention gating mechanism dynamically controls the role of visual evidence and text prior information during generation. The entire framework takes end-to-end training, and combines the comparison loss, the retrieval loss and the generation loss to form multi-task optimization objectives, and achieves image understanding and policy matching in collaborative learning. The results demonstrate superior performance in retrieval accuracy and classification index on damage severity, where the Top-1 retrieval accuracy has been improved by 9.6%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Aligning LLMs for the Classroom with Knowledge-Based Retrieval -- A Comparative RAG Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07846v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models like ChatGPT are increasingly used in classrooms, but they often provide outdated or fabricated information that can mislead students. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) improves reliability of LLMs by grounding responses in external resources. We investigate two accessible RAG paradigms, vector-based retrieval and graph-based retrieval to identify best practices for classroom question answering (QA). Existing comparative studies fail to account for pedagogical factors such as educational disciplines, question types, and practical deployment costs. Using a novel dataset, EduScopeQA, of 3,176 questions across academic subjects, we measure performance on various educational query types, from specific facts to broad thematic discussions. We also evaluate system alignment with a dataset of systematically altered textbooks that contradict the LLM's latent knowledge. We find that OpenAI Vector Search RAG (representing vector-based RAG) performs well as a low-cost generalist, especially for quick fact retrieval. On the other hand, GraphRAG Global excels at providing pedagogically rich answers to thematic queries, and GraphRAG Local achieves the highest accuracy with the dense, altered textbooks when corpus integrity is critical. Accounting for the 10-20x higher resource usage of GraphRAG (representing graph-based RAG), we show that a dynamic branching framework that routes queries to the optimal retrieval method boosts fidelity and efficiency. These insights provide actionable guidelines for educators and system designers to integrate RAG-augmented LLMs into learning environments effectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

However, most existing RAG research in finance focuses predominantly on textual data, overlooking the rich visual content in financial documents, resulting in the loss of key analytical insights. To bridge this gap, we present FinRAGBench-V, a comprehensive visual RAG benchmark tailored for finance which effectively integrates multimodal data and provides visual citation to ensure traceability. It includes a bilingual retrieval corpus with 60,780 Chinese and 51,219 English pages, along with a high-quality, human-annotated question-answering (QA) dataset spanning heterogeneous data types and seven question categories. Moreover, we introduce RGenCite, an RAG baseline that seamlessly integrates visual citation with generation. Furthermore, we propose an automatic citation evaluation method to systematically assess the visual citation capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Extensive experiments on RGenCite underscore the challenging nature of FinRAGBench-V, providing valuable insights for the development of multimodal RAG systems in finance.</p></details> |  |

Existing coarse-ranking optimization approaches often struggle to balance domain-specific knowledge learning with query enhencement, resulting in suboptimal retrieval performance. To address this challenge, we propose MoLER, a domain-aware RAG method that uses MoL-Enhanced Reinforcement Learning to optimize retrieval. MoLER has a two-stage pipeline: a continual pre-training (CPT) phase using a Mixture of Losses (MoL) to balance domain-specific knowledge with general language capabilities, and a reinforcement learning (RL) phase leveraging Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to optimize query and passage generation for maximizing document recall. A key innovation is our Multi-query Single-passage Late Fusion (MSLF) strategy, which reduces computational overhead during RL training while maintaining scalable inference via Multi-query Multi-passage Late Fusion (MMLF). Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that MoLER achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming baseline methods. MoLER bridges the knowledge gap in RAG systems, enabling robust and scalable retrieval in specialized domains.</p></details> |  |

However, LLMs often fail to faithfully integrate retrieved evidence into their generated responses, leading to factual inconsistencies. To quantify this gap, we introduce Entity-Context Divergence (ECD), a metric that measures the extent to which retrieved information is accurately reflected in model outputs. We systematically evaluate contemporary LLMs on their ability to preserve factual consistency in retrieval-augmented settings, a capability we define as RAG-ability. Our empirical analysis reveals that RAG-ability remains low across most LLMs, highlighting significant challenges in entity retention and context fidelity. This paper introduces Radiant (Retrieval AugmenteD entIty-context AligNmenT), a novel framework that merges RAG with alignment designed to optimize the interplay between retrieved evidence and generated content. Radiant extends Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to teach LLMs how to integrate provided additional information into subsequent generations. As a behavior correction mechanism, Radiant boosts RAG performance across varied retrieval scenarios, such as noisy web contexts, knowledge conflicts, and hallucination reduction. This enables more reliable, contextually grounded, and factually coherent content generation.</p></details> |  |

Addressing the shortcomings of conventional health search engines and the lag in public access to biomedical research, the system integrates diverse sources, including PubMed articles, curated Q&A datasets, and medical encyclopedias ,to retrieve relevant information and generate concise, context-aware responses. The retrieval pipeline uses MiniLM-based semantic embeddings and FAISS vector search, while answer generation is performed by a fine-tuned Mistral-7B-v0.3 language model optimized using QLoRA for efficient, low-resource training. The system supports both general medical queries and domain-specific tasks, with a focused evaluation on breast cancer literature demonstrating the value of domain-aligned retrieval. Empirical results, measured using BERTScore (F1), show substantial improvements in factual consistency and semantic relevance compared to baseline models. The findings underscore the potential of RAG-enhanced language models to bridge the gap between complex biomedical literature and accessible public health knowledge, paving the way for future work on multilingual adaptation, privacy-preserving inference, and personalized medical AI systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Graph RAG as Human Choice Model: Building a Data-Driven Mobility Agent with Preference Chain](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16172v2)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding human behavior in urban environments is a crucial field within city sciences. However, collecting accurate behavioral data, particularly in newly developed areas, poses significant challenges. Recent advances in generative agents, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), have shown promise in simulating human behaviors without relying on extensive datasets. Nevertheless, these methods often struggle with generating consistent, context-sensitive, and realistic behavioral outputs. To address these limitations, this paper introduces the Preference Chain, a novel method that integrates Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with LLMs to enhance context-aware simulation of human behavior in transportation systems. Experiments conducted on the Replica dataset demonstrate that the Preference Chain outperforms standard LLM in aligning with real-world transportation mode choices. The development of the Mobility Agent highlights potential applications of proposed method in urban mobility modeling for emerging cities, personalized travel behavior analysis, and dynamic traffic forecasting. Despite limitations such as slow inference and the risk of hallucination, the method offers a promising framework for simulating complex human behavior in data-scarce environments, where traditional data-driven models struggle due to limited data availability.</p></details> |  |

Distillation-Guided Policy Optimization for Preserving Agentic RAG Capabilities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20324v2)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning has emerged as a post-training approach to elicit agentic RAG behaviors such as search and planning from language models. However, compact language models (e.g., 0.5B parameters) struggle due to poor reasoning ability, resulting in sparse rewards and unstable training. To overcome these difficulties, we propose Distillation-Guided Policy Optimization (DGPO), which addresses the challenges through cold-start initialization from teacher demonstrations and continuous teacher guidance during policy optimization. To systematically evaluate our approach, we introduce Agentic RAG Capabilities (ARC), a fine-grained metric analyzing reasoning, search coordination, and response synthesis. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that DGPO enables compact models to achieve sophisticated agentic search behaviors, even outperforming the larger teacher model in some cases. DGPO makes agentic RAG feasible in computing resource-constrained environments.</p></details> |  |

Our approach addresses the challenges of understanding and retrieving complex technical content by leveraging the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). First, we enhance user queries by generating expanded representations that better capture user intent and improve dataset diversity, thereby enriching the fine-tuning process for embedding models. Second, we apply summary extraction techniques to encode essential contextual information, refining the representation of technical documents. To further enhance retrieval performance, we fine-tune a bi-encoder BERT model using soft prompting, incorporating separate learning parameters for queries and document context to capture fine-grained semantic nuances. We evaluate our approach on two public datasets, RAG-EDA and Rust-Docs-QA, demonstrating that Technical-Embeddings significantly outperforms baseline models in both precision and recall. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of integrating query expansion and contextual summarization to enhance information access and comprehension in technical domains. This work advances the state of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, offering new avenues for efficient and accurate technical document retrieval in engineering and product development workflows.</p></details> |  |

To enrich the generation process with broader insights and reduce the chance of missing important research directions, we use context from related papers using RAG. We experimented with various Large Language Models (LLMs) integrated into Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). We incorporate an LLM feedback mechanism to enhance the quality of the generated content and introduce an LLM-as-a-judge framework for robust evaluation, assessing key aspects such as novelty, hallucination, and feasibility. Our results demonstrate that the RAG-based approach using GPT-4o mini, combined with an LLM feedback mechanism, outperforms other methods based on both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) improves accuracy by grounding outputs in external knowledge, especially in domains like healthcare, where precision is vital. However, RAG remains opaque and essentially a black box, heavily dependent on data quality. We developed a method-agnostic, perturbation-based framework that provides token and component-level interoperability for Graph RAG using SMILE and named it as Knowledge-Graph (KG)-SMILE. By applying controlled perturbations, computing similarities, and training weighted linear surrogates, KG-SMILE identifies the graph entities and relations most influential to generated outputs, thereby making RAG more transparent. We evaluate KG-SMILE using comprehensive attribution metrics, including fidelity, faithfulness, consistency, stability, and accuracy. Our findings show that KG-SMILE produces stable, human-aligned explanations, demonstrating its capacity to balance model effectiveness with interpretability and thereby fostering greater transparency and trust in machine learning technologies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal Iterative RAG for Knowledge Visual Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00798v2)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly advanced multimodal understanding, their performance remains limited on knowledge-intensive visual questions that require external knowledge beyond the image. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a promising solution for providing models with external knowledge, its conventional single-pass framework often fails to gather sufficient knowledge. To overcome this limitation, we propose MI-RAG, a Multimodal Iterative RAG framework that leverages reasoning to enhance retrieval and update reasoning over newly retrieved knowledge across modalities. At each iteration, MI-RAG leverages an accumulated reasoning record to dynamically formulate a multi-query. These queries then drive a joint search across heterogeneous knowledge bases containing both visually-grounded and textual knowledge. The newly acquired knowledge is synthesized into the reasoning record, progressively refining understanding across iterations. Experiments on challenging benchmarks, including Encyclopedic VQA, InfoSeek, and OK-VQA, show that MI-RAG significantly improves both retrieval recall and answer accuracy, establishing a scalable approach for compositional reasoning in knowledge-intensive VQA.</p></details> |  |

However, effectively combining evidence from these heterogeneous sources is challenging as the respective similarity scores are not inter-comparable. Additionally, aggregating beliefs from the outputs of multiple rankers can improve the effectiveness of RAG. Our proposed method first aggregates the top-documents from a number of IR models using a standard rank fusion technique for each source (labeled and unlabeled). Next, we standardize the retrieval score distributions within each source by applying z-score transformation before merging the top-retrieved documents from the two sources. We evaluate our approach on the fact verification task, demonstrating that it consistently improves over the best-performing individual ranker or source and also shows better out-of-domain generalization.</p></details> |  |
| **[VaccineRAG: Boosting Multimodal Large Language Models' Immunity to Harmful RAG Samples](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04502v1)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval Augmented Generation enhances the response accuracy of Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating retrieval and generation modules with external knowledge, demonstrating particular strength in real-time queries and Visual Question Answering tasks. However, the effectiveness of RAG is frequently hindered by the precision of the retriever: many retrieved samples fed into the generation phase are irrelevant or misleading, posing a critical bottleneck to LLMs' performance. To address this challenge, we introduce VaccineRAG, a novel Chain-of-Thought-based retrieval-augmented generation dataset. On one hand, VaccineRAG employs a benchmark to evaluate models using data with varying positive/negative sample ratios, systematically exposing inherent weaknesses in current LLMs. On the other hand, it enhances models' sample-discrimination capabilities by prompting LLMs to generate explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) analysis for each sample before producing final answers. Furthermore, to enhance the model's ability to learn long-sequence complex CoT content, we propose Partial-GRPO. By modeling the outputs of LLMs as multiple components rather than a single whole, our model can make more informed preference selections for complex sequences, thereby enhancing its capacity to learn complex CoT. Comprehensive evaluations and ablation studies on VaccineRAG validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. The code and dataset will be publicly released soon.</p></details> |  |

In the financial field, the stringent demands for professional accuracy and real-time data processing often necessitate the use of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques. However, the development of financial RAG benchmarks has been constrained by data confidentiality issues and the lack of dynamic data integration. To address this issue, we introduce FinS-Pilot, a novel benchmark for evaluating RAG systems in online financial applications. Constructed from real-world financial assistant interactions, our benchmark incorporates both real-time API data and text data, organized through an intent classification framework covering critical financial domains. The benchmark enables comprehensive evaluation of financial assistants' capabilities in handling both static knowledge and time-sensitive market information.Through systematic experiments with multiple Chinese leading LLMs, we demonstrate FinS-Pilot's effectiveness in identifying models suitable for financial applications while addressing the current gap in specialized evaluation tools for the financial domain. Our work contributes both a practical evaluation framework and a curated dataset to advance research in financial NLP systems. The code and dataset are accessible on GitHub.</p></details> |  |
| **[REFRAG: Rethinking RAG based Decoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01092v1)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in leveraging extensive external knowledge to enhance responses in multi-turn and agentic applications, such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). However, processing long-context inputs introduces significant system latency and demands substantial memory for the key-value cache, resulting in reduced throughput and a fundamental trade-off between knowledge enrichment and system efficiency. While minimizing latency for long-context inputs is a primary objective for LLMs, we contend that RAG require specialized consideration. In RAG, much of the LLM context consists of concatenated passages from retrieval, with only a small subset directly relevant to the query. These passages often exhibit low semantic similarity due to diversity or deduplication during re-ranking, leading to block-diagonal attention patterns that differ from those in standard LLM generation tasks. Based on this observation, we argue that most computations over the RAG context during decoding are unnecessary and can be eliminated with minimal impact on performance. To this end, we propose REFRAG, an efficient decoding framework that compresses, senses, and expands to improve latency in RAG applications. By exploiting the sparsity structure, we demonstrate a 30.85 the time-to-first-token acceleration (3.75 improvement to previous work) without loss in perplexity. In addition, our optimization framework for large context enables REFRAG to extend the context size of LLMs by 16. We provide rigorous validation of REFRAG across diverse long-context tasks, including RAG, multi-turn conversations, and long document summarization, spanning a wide range of datasets. Experimental results confirm that REFRAG delivers substantial speedup with no loss in accuracy compared to LLaMA models and other state-of-the-art baselines across various context sizes.</p></details> |  |

As an essential part of RAG, external knowledge bases are commonly built by extracting structured data from unstructured PDF documents using Optical Character Recognition (OCR). However, given the imperfect prediction of OCR and the inherent non-uniform representation of structured data, knowledge bases inevitably contain various OCR noises. In this paper, we introduce OHRBench, the first benchmark for understanding the cascading impact of OCR on RAG systems. OHRBench includes 8,561 carefully selected unstructured document images from seven real-world RAG application domains, along with 8,498 Q&A pairs derived from multimodal elements in documents, challenging existing OCR solutions used for RAG. To better understand OCR's impact on RAG systems, we identify two primary types of OCR noise: Semantic Noise and Formatting Noise and apply perturbation to generate a set of structured data with varying degrees of each OCR noise. Using OHRBench, we first conduct a comprehensive evaluation of current OCR solutions and reveal that none is competent for constructing high-quality knowledge bases for RAG systems. We then systematically evaluate the impact of these two noise types and demonstrate the trend relationship between the degree of OCR noise and RAG performance. Our OHRBench, including PDF documents, Q&As, and the ground truth structured data are released at: https://github.com/opendatalab/OHR-Bench</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |

Empirical Insights into Reasoning under Incomplete Knowledge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08344v2)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (KG-RAG) is an increasingly explored approach for combining the reasoning capabilities of large language models with the structured evidence of knowledge graphs. However, current evaluation practices fall short: existing benchmarks often include questions that can be directly answered using existing triples in KG, making it unclear whether models perform reasoning or simply retrieve answers directly. Moreover, inconsistent evaluation metrics and lenient answer matching criteria further obscure meaningful comparisons. In this work, we introduce a general method for constructing benchmarks, together with an evaluation protocol, to systematically assess KG-RAG methods under knowledge incompleteness. Our empirical results show that current KG-RAG methods have limited reasoning ability under missing knowledge, often rely on internal memorization, and exhibit varying degrees of generalization depending on their design.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic Context Compression for Efficient RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22931v2)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge but incurs significant inference costs due to lengthy retrieved contexts. While context compression mitigates this issue, existing methods apply fixed compression rates, over-compressing simple queries or under-compressing complex ones. We propose Adaptive Context Compression for RAG (ACC-RAG), a framework that dynamically adjusts compression rates based on input complexity, optimizing inference efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. ACC-RAG combines a hierarchical compressor (for multi-granular embeddings) with a context selector to retain minimal sufficient information, akin to human skimming. Evaluated on Wikipedia and five QA datasets, ACC-RAG outperforms fixed-rate methods and matches/unlocks over 4 times faster inference versus standard RAG while maintaining or improving accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[MODE: Mixture of Document Experts for RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00100v1)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) often relies on large vector databases and cross-encoders tuned for large-scale corpora, which can be excessive for small, domain-specific collections. We present MODE (Mixture of Document Experts), a lightweight alternative that replaces fine-grained nearest-neighbor search with cluster-and-route retrieval. Documents are embedded, grouped into semantically coherent clusters, and represented by cached centroids. At query time, we route to the top centroid(s) and retrieve context only within those clusters, eliminating external vector-database infrastructure and reranking while keeping latency low. On HotpotQA and SQuAD corpora with 100-500 chunks, MODE matches or exceeds a dense-retrieval baseline in answer quality while reducing end-to-end retrieval time. Ablations show that cluster granularity and multi-cluster routing control the recall/precision trade-off, and that tighter clusters improve downstream accuracy. MODE offers a practical recipe for small and medium corpora where simplicity, speed, and topical focus matter.</p></details> |  |

In response, we developed a mental health support chatbot designed to augment professional healthcare, with a strong emphasis on safe and meaningful application. Our approach involved rigorous evaluation, covering accuracy, empathy, trustworthiness, privacy, and bias. We employed a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework, integrated prompt engineering, and fine-tuned a pre-trained model on novel datasets. The resulting system, Mentalic Net Conversational AI, achieved a BERT Score of 0.898, with other evaluation metrics falling within satisfactory ranges.

However, the effectiveness and trustworthiness of these systems critically depends on how they are evaluated, particularly on whether the evaluation process captures real-world constraints like protecting sensitive information. While current evaluation efforts for RAG systems have primarily focused on the development of performance metrics, far less attention has been given to the design and quality of the underlying evaluation datasets, despite their pivotal role in enabling meaningful, reliable assessments. In this work, we introduce a novel multi-agent framework for generating synthetic QA datasets for RAG evaluation that prioritize semantic diversity and privacy preservation. Our approach involves: (1) a Diversity agent leveraging clustering techniques to maximize topical coverage and semantic variability, (2) a Privacy Agent that detects and mask sensitive information across multiple domains and (3) a QA curation agent that synthesizes private and diverse QA pairs suitable as ground truth for RAG evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our evaluation sets outperform baseline methods in diversity and achieve robust privacy masking on domain-specific datasets. This work offers a practical and ethically aligned pathway toward safer, more comprehensive RAG system evaluation, laying the foundation for future enhancements aligned with evolving AI regulations and compliance standards.</p></details> | <details><summary>ECAI ...</summary><p>ECAI 2025 TRUST AI workshop</p></details> |

Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) indexing methods aim to address this challenge by selectively retrieving only necessary document segments. However, narrative texts possess unique characteristics that limit the effectiveness of these existing approaches. Specifically, understanding narrative texts requires more than isolated segments, as the broader context and sequential relationships between segments are crucial for comprehension. To address these limitations, we propose ChronoRAG, a novel RAG framework specialized for narrative texts. This approach focuses on two essential aspects: refining dispersed document information into coherent and structured passages, and preserving narrative flow by explicitly capturing and maintaining the temporal order among retrieved passages. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of ChronoRAG through experiments on the NarrativeQA dataset, showing substantial improvements in tasks requiring both factual identification and comprehension of complex sequential relationships, underscoring that reasoning over temporal order is crucial in resolving narrative QA.</p></details> | 7 pages, 3 figures |

However, co-locating the vector retriever and the LLM on shared GPU infrastructure introduces significant challenges: vector search is memory and I/O intensive, while LLM inference demands high throughput and low latency. Naive resource sharing often leads to severe performance degradation, particularly under high request load or large index sizes. We present VectorLiteRAG, a deployment-friendly RAG system that achieves latency-compliant inference without requiring additional hardware resources. VectorLiteRAG introduces a fine-grained GPU resource allocation mechanism based on detailed performance modeling and access pattern analysis. By estimating search latency and query hit rate distributions, it identifies an optimal index partitioning point across CPU and GPU tiers to minimize contention and maximize throughput. Our evaluations show that VectorLiteRAG consistently expands the SLO compliant request rate range across all tested configurations, including both small and large LLMs, and small and large vector databases compared to naive baselines and state of the art alternatives. In the best case, VectorLiteRAG improves the attainable SLO throughput by up to 1.5 times without compromising generation quality or requiring additional compute resources.</p></details> |  |

Our benchmark is built on a user manual for an agricultural machine, available in English, French, and German. It simulates a cross-lingual information retrieval scenario where questions are posed in English against all three language versions of the manual. The evaluation focuses on realistic "needle-in-a-haystack" challenges and includes unanswerable questions to test for hallucinations. We compare nine long-context LLMs using direct prompting against three Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) strategies (keyword, semantic, hybrid), with an LLM-as-a-judge for evaluation. Our findings for this specific manual show that Hybrid RAG consistently outperforms direct long-context prompting. Models like Gemini 2.5 Flash and the smaller Qwen 2.5 7B achieve high accuracy (over 85%) across all languages with RAG. This paper contributes a detailed analysis of LLM performance in a specialized industrial domain and an open framework for similar evaluations, highlighting practical trade-offs and challenges.</p></details> |  |

On the first level of analytics, the fine-tuned model generates graph and text summaries with sentiment scores as well as JSON representations of summaries. Higher levels perform hierarchical stacking that consolidates sets of graph-based and text-based summaries as well as summaries of summaries into comprehensive reports. The combination of graph and text summaries provides complementary views of cryptocurrency news. The model is fine-tuned with 4-bit quantization using the PEFT/LoRA approach. The representation of cryptocurrency news as knowledge graph can essentially eliminate problems with large language model hallucinations. The obtained results demonstrate that the use of fine-tuned Mistral 7B LLM models for multilevel cryptocurrency news analysis can conduct informative qualitative and quantitative analytics, providing important insights.</p></details> |  |

Learned query optimizers (LQOs) can improve performance over time by incorporating feedback; however, they suffer from cold-start issues and often require retraining when workloads shift or schemas change. Recent LLM-based query optimizers leverage pre-trained and fine-tuned LLMs to mitigate these challenges. Nevertheless, they neglect LLMs' in-context learning and execution records as feedback for continuous evolution. In this paper, we present SEFRQO, a Self-Evolving Fine-tuned RAG-based Query Optimizer. SEFRQO mitigates the cold-start problem of LQOs by continuously learning from execution feedback via a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework. We employ both supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement fine-tuning to prepare the LLM to produce syntactically correct and performance-efficient query hints. Moreover, SEFRQO leverages the LLM's in-context learning capabilities by dynamically constructing prompts with references to similar queries and the historical execution record of the same query. This self-evolving paradigm iteratively optimizes the prompt to minimize query execution latency. Evaluations show that SEFRQO outperforms state-of-the-art LQOs, achieving up to 65.05% and 93.57% reductions in query latency on the CEB and Stack workloads, respectively, compared to PostgreSQL.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at SIGMOD 2026 (https://2026.sigmod.org/)</p></details> |

Despite its widespread use, most RAG pipelines continue to treat retrieval and reasoning as isolated components, retrieving documents once and then generating answers without further interaction. This static design often limits performance on complex tasks that require iterative evidence gathering or high-precision retrieval. Recent work in both the information retrieval (IR) and NLP communities has begun to close this gap by introducing adaptive retrieval and ranking methods that incorporate feedback. In this survey, we present a structured overview of advanced retrieval and ranking mechanisms that integrate such feedback. We categorize feedback signals based on their source and role in improving the query, retrieved context, or document pool. By consolidating these developments, we aim to bridge IR and NLP perspectives and highlight retrieval as a dynamic, learnable component of end-to-end RAG systems.</p></details> | 18 pages, 1 figure |

Simulating Vulnerabilities, and Threats in Multimodal Medical RAG System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17215v1)** | 2025-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) augmented with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) are increasingly employed in medical AI to enhance factual grounding through external clinical image-text retrieval. However, this reliance creates a significant attack surface. We propose MedThreatRAG, a novel multimodal poisoning framework that systematically probes vulnerabilities in medical RAG systems by injecting adversarial image-text pairs. A key innovation of our approach is the construction of a simulated semi-open attack environment, mimicking real-world medical systems that permit periodic knowledge base updates via user or pipeline contributions. Within this setting, we introduce and emphasize Cross-Modal Conflict Injection (CMCI), which embeds subtle semantic contradictions between medical images and their paired reports. These mismatches degrade retrieval and generation by disrupting cross-modal alignment while remaining sufficiently plausible to evade conventional filters. While basic textual and visual attacks are included for completeness, CMCI demonstrates the most severe degradation. Evaluations on IU-Xray and MIMIC-CXR QA tasks show that MedThreatRAG reduces answer F1 scores by up to 27.66% and lowers LLaVA-Med-1.5 F1 rates to as low as 51.36%. Our findings expose fundamental security gaps in clinical RAG systems and highlight the urgent need for threat-aware design and robust multimodal consistency checks. Finally, we conclude with a concise set of guidelines to inform the safe development of future multimodal medical RAG systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Sumbi...</summary><p>Sumbitted to 2025 AAAI main track</p></details> |

Large Language Models (LLMs) offer unprecedented analytical opportunities however, their knowledge base is constrained to the models' last training date, rendering these capabilities unusable for organizations whose mission impacts rely on emerging and timely information. This research proposes an innovative approach to supply chain analysis by integrating emerging Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) preprocessing and retrieval techniques with advanced web-scraping technologies. Our method aims to reduce latency in incorporating new information into an augmented-LLM, enabling timely analysis of supply chain disruptors. Through experimentation, this study evaluates the combinatorial effects of these techniques towards timeliness and quality trade-offs. Our results suggest that in applying RAG systems to supply chain analysis, fine-tuning the embedding retrieval model consistently provides the most significant performance gains, underscoring the critical importance of retrieval quality. Adaptive iterative retrieval, which dynamically adjusts retrieval depth based on context, further enhances performance, especially on complex supply chain queries. Conversely, fine-tuning the LLM yields limited improvements and higher resource costs, while techniques such as downward query abstraction significantly outperforms upward abstraction in practice.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 5 figures, 1 table.

While RDF/OWL reasoners enable graph-based reasoning, they are limited to fragments of first-order logic, preventing deeper temporal and semantic analysis. This paper addresses both challenges by developing automatic historical event extraction models using multiple LLMs (GPT-4, Claude, Llama 3.2) with three enhancement strategies: pure base generation, knowledge graph enhancement, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). We conducted comprehensive evaluations using historical texts from Thucydides. Our findings reveal that enhancement strategies optimize different performance dimensions rather than providing universal improvements. For coverage and historical breadth, base generation achieves optimal performance with Claude and GPT-4 extracting comprehensive events. However, for precision, RAG enhancement improves coordinate accuracy and metadata completeness. Model architecture fundamentally determines enhancement sensitivity: larger models demonstrate robust baseline performance with incremental RAG improvements, while Llama 3.2 shows extreme variance from competitive performance to complete failure. We then developed an automated translation pipeline converting extracted RDF representations into Coq proof assistant specifications, enabling higher-order reasoning beyond RDF capabilities including multi-step causal verification, temporal arithmetic with BC dates, and formal proofs about historical causation. The Coq formalization validates that RAG-discovered event types represent legitimate domain-specific semantic structures rather than ontological violations.</p></details> |  |

These benchmarks overlook key factors such as the interaction between retrieval difficulty and reasoning depth. To address this gap, we propose \textsc{GRADE}, a novel evaluation framework that models task difficulty along two orthogonal dimensions: (1) reasoning depth, defined by the number of inference steps (hops), and (2) semantic distance between the query and its supporting evidence. We construct a synthetic multi-hop QA dataset from factual news articles by extracting knowledge graphs and augmenting them through semantic clustering to recover missing links, allowing us to generate diverse and difficulty-controlled queries. Central to our framework is a 2D difficulty matrix that combines generator-side and retriever-side difficulty. Experiments across multiple domains and models show that error rates strongly correlate with our difficulty measures, validating their diagnostic utility. \textsc{GRADE} enables fine-grained analysis of RAG performance and provides a scalable foundation for evaluating and improving multi-hop reasoning in real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP 2025 findings</p></details> |

LLMs may provide answers that appear correct, but could contain hallucinated information. Thus, building benchmarks that can evaluate LLMs on multi-turn RAG conversations has become an increasingly important task. Simulating real-world conversations is vital for producing high quality evaluation benchmarks.

Retrieval and tool-augmented methods help, but their impact is limited by weak use of external knowledge and poor feedback-reasoning traceability. To address these challenges, We introduce Deep-DxSearch, an agentic RAG system trained end-to-end with reinforcement learning (RL) that enables steer tracebale retrieval-augmented reasoning for medical diagnosis. In Deep-DxSearch, we first construct a large-scale medical retrieval corpus comprising patient records and reliable medical knowledge sources to support retrieval-aware reasoning across diagnostic scenarios. More crutially, we frame the LLM as the core agent and the retrieval corpus as its environment, using tailored rewards on format, retrieval, reasoning structure, and diagnostic accuracy, thereby evolving the agentic RAG policy from large-scale data through RL. Experiments demonstrate that our end-to-end agentic RL training framework consistently outperforms prompt-engineering and training-free RAG approaches across multiple data centers. After training, Deep-DxSearch achieves substantial gains in diagnostic accuracy, surpassing strong diagnostic baselines such as GPT-4o, DeepSeek-R1, and other medical-specific frameworks for both common and rare disease diagnosis under in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings. Moreover, ablation studies on reward design and retrieval corpus components confirm their critical roles, underscoring the uniqueness and effectiveness of our approach compared with traditional implementations. Finally, case studies and interpretability analyses highlight improvements in Deep-DxSearch's diagnostic policy, providing deeper insight into its performance gains and supporting clinicians in delivering more reliable and precise preliminary diagnoses.

Within the ORAN architecture, Large Language Models (LLMs) can be specialized to generate xApps and rApps by leveraging specifications and API definitions from the RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC) platform. However, fine-tuning base LLMs for telecom-specific tasks remains expensive and resource-intensive. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers a practical alternative through in-context learning, enabling domain adaptation without full retraining. While traditional RAG systems rely on vector-based retrieval, emerging variants such as GraphRAG and Hybrid GraphRAG incorporate knowledge graphs or dual retrieval strategies to support multi-hop reasoning and improve factual grounding. Despite their promise, these methods lack systematic, metric-driven evaluations, particularly in high-stakes domains such as ORAN. In this study, we conduct a comparative evaluation of Vector RAG, GraphRAG, and Hybrid GraphRAG using ORAN specifications. We assess performance across varying question complexities using established generation metrics: faithfulness, answer relevance, context relevance, and factual correctness. Results show that both GraphRAG and Hybrid GraphRAG outperform traditional RAG. Hybrid GraphRAG improves factual correctness by 8%, while GraphRAG improves context relevance by 11%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Each to Their Own: Exploring the Optimal Embedding in RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17442v2)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, as Large Language Models (LLMs) have fundamentally impacted various fields, the methods for incorporating up-to-date information into LLMs or adding external knowledge to construct domain-specific models have garnered wide attention. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), serving as an inference-time scaling method, is notable for its low cost and minimal effort for parameter tuning. However, due to heterogeneous training data and model architecture, the variant embedding models used in RAG exhibit different benefits across various areas, often leading to different similarity calculation results and, consequently, varying response quality from LLMs. To address this problem, we propose and examine two approaches to enhance RAG by combining the benefits of multiple embedding models, named Mixture-Embedding RAG and Confident RAG. Mixture-Embedding RAG simply sorts and selects retrievals from multiple embedding models based on standardized similarity; however, it does not outperform vanilla RAG. In contrast, Confident RAG generates responses multiple times using different embedding models and then selects the responses with the highest confidence level, demonstrating average improvements of approximately 10% and 5% over vanilla LLMs and RAG, respectively. The consistent results across different LLMs and embedding models indicate that Confident RAG is an efficient plug-and-play approach for various domains. We will release our code upon publication.</p></details> |  |

Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) offers a practical and privacy-preserving way to enhance LLMs with external medical knowledge. However, most existing approaches rely on surface-level semantic retrieval and lack the structured reasoning needed for clinical decision support. We introduce MedCoT-RAG, a domain-specific framework that combines causal-aware document retrieval with structured chain-of-thought prompting tailored to medical workflows. This design enables models to retrieve evidence aligned with diagnostic logic and generate step-by-step causal reasoning reflective of real-world clinical practice. Experiments on three diverse medical QA benchmarks show that MedCoT-RAG outperforms strong baselines by up to 10.3% over vanilla RAG and 6.4% over advanced domain-adapted methods, improving accuracy, interpretability, and consistency in complex medical tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, despite the emergence of various RAG frameworks, a single RAG framework still cannot adapt well to a broad range of downstream tasks. Therefore, how to leverage the advantages of multiple RAG systems has become an area worth exploring. To address this issue, we have conducted a comprehensive and systematic investigation into ensemble methods based on RAG systems. Specifically, we have analyzed the RAG ensemble framework from both theoretical and mechanistic analysis perspectives. From the theoretical analysis, we provide the first explanation of the RAG ensemble framework from the perspective of information entropy. In terms of mechanism analysis, we have explored the RAG ensemble framework from both the pipeline and module levels. We carefully select four different pipelines (Branching, Iterative, Loop, and Agentic) and three different modules (Generator, Retriever, and Reranker) to solve seven different research questions. The experiments show that aggregating multiple RAG systems is both generalizable and robust, whether at the pipeline level or the module level. Our work lays the foundation for similar research on the multi-RAG system ensemble.</p></details> |  |

We validate the effectiveness of GridCodex with comprehensive benchmarks, including automated answer assessment across multiple dimensions and regulatory agencies. Experimental results showcase a 26.4% improvement in answer quality and more than a 10 fold increase in recall rate.

Across four datasets, of which two open-domain and two proprietary, we find that synthetic benchmarks reliably rank the RAGs varying in terms of retriever configuration, aligning well with human-labeled benchmark baselines. However, they fail to produce consistent RAG rankings when comparing generator architectures.

However, its current workflow remains largely text-centric, limiting its applicability in geoscience. Many geoscientific tasks are inherently evidence-hungry. Typical examples involve imputing missing observations using analog scenes, retrieving equations and parameters to calibrate models, geolocating field photos based on visual cues, or surfacing historical case studies to support policy analyses. A simple ``retrieve-then-generate'' pipeline is insufficient for these needs. We envision Geo-RAG, a next-generation paradigm that reimagines RAG as a modular retrieve $\rightarrow$ reason $\rightarrow$ generate $\rightarrow$ verify loop. Geo-RAG supports four core capabilities: (i) retrieval of multi-modal Earth data; (ii) reasoning under physical and domain constraints; (iii) generation of science-grade artifacts; and (iv) verification of generated hypotheses against numerical models, ground measurements, and expert assessments. This shift opens new opportunities for more trustworthy and transparent geoscience workflows.</p></details> |  |

Given the LLM's diminished reasoning over extended context and high computational cost, retrieval-based approaches remain a pivotal role in practice. However, traditional RAG methods can fall short due to their stateless, single-step retrieval process, which often overlooks the dynamic nature of capturing interconnected relations within long-range context. In this work, we propose ComoRAG, holding the principle that narrative reasoning is not a one-shot process, but a dynamic, evolving interplay between new evidence acquisition and past knowledge consolidation, analogous to human cognition when reasoning with memory-related signals in the brain. Specifically, when encountering a reasoning impasse, ComoRAG undergoes iterative reasoning cycles while interacting with a dynamic memory workspace. In each cycle, it generates probing queries to devise new exploratory paths, then integrates the retrieved evidence of new aspects into a global memory pool, thereby supporting the emergence of a coherent context for the query resolution. Across four challenging long-context narrative benchmarks (200K+ tokens), ComoRAG outperforms strong RAG baselines with consistent relative gains up to 11% compared to the strongest baseline. Further analysis reveals that ComoRAG is particularly advantageous for complex queries requiring global comprehension, offering a principled, cognitively motivated paradigm for retrieval-based long context comprehension towards stateful reasoning.

Within financial sectors, modern enterprises increasingly rely on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems to address complex compliance requirements in financial document workflows. However, existing solutions struggle to account for the inherent heterogeneity of data (e.g., text, tables, diagrams) and evolving nature of regulatory standards used in financial filings, leading to compromised accuracy in critical information extraction. We propose the FinSage framework as a solution, utilizing a multi-aspect RAG framework tailored for regulatory compliance analysis in multi-modal financial documents. FinSage introduces three innovative components: (1) a multi-modal pre-processing pipeline that unifies diverse data formats and generates chunk-level metadata summaries, (2) a multi-path sparse-dense retrieval system augmented with query expansion (HyDE) and metadata-aware semantic search, and (3) a domain-specialized re-ranking module fine-tuned via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to prioritize compliance-critical content. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FinSage achieves an impressive recall of 92.51% on 75 expert-curated questions derived from surpasses the best baseline method on the FinanceBench question answering datasets by 24.06% in accuracy. Moreover, FinSage has been successfully deployed as financial question-answering agent in online meetings, where it has already served more than 1,200 people.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 34th ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM2025)</p></details> |

Auditing Membership Leakage in Semi-Black-box RAG Controlling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09105v2)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and its Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MRAG) significantly improve the knowledge coverage and contextual understanding of Large Language Models (LLMs) by introducing external knowledge sources. However, retrieval and multimodal fusion obscure content provenance, rendering existing membership inference methods unable to reliably attribute generated outputs to pre-training, external retrieval, or user input, thus undermining privacy leakage accountability To address these challenges, we propose the first Source-aware Membership Audit (SMA) that enables fine-grained source attribution of generated content in a semi-black-box setting with retrieval control capabilities. To address the environmental constraints of semi-black-box auditing, we further design an attribution estimation mechanism based on zero-order optimization, which robustly approximates the true influence of input tokens on the output through large-scale perturbation sampling and ridge regression modeling. In addition, SMA introduces a cross-modal attribution technique that projects image inputs into textual descriptions via MLLMs, enabling token-level attribution in the text modality, which for the first time facilitates membership inference on image retrieval traces in MRAG systems. This work shifts the focus of membership inference from 'whether the data has been memorized' to 'where the content is sourced from', offering a novel perspective for auditing data provenance in complex generative systems.</p></details> |  |

Data augmentation can potentially alleviate the data shortage, but augmenting vulnerable code is challenging and requires a generative solution that maintains vulnerability. Previous works have only focused on generating samples that contain single statements or specific types of vulnerabilities. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been used to solve various code generation and comprehension tasks with inspiring results, especially when fused with retrieval augmented generation (RAG). Therefore, we propose VulScribeR, a novel LLM-based solution that leverages carefully curated prompt templates to augment vulnerable datasets. More specifically, we explore three strategies to augment both single and multi-statement vulnerabilities, with LLMs, namely Mutation, Injection, and Extension. Our extensive evaluation across four vulnerability datasets and DLVD models, using three LLMs, show that our approach beats two SOTA methods Vulgen and VGX, and Random Oversampling (ROS) by 27.48%, 27.93%, and 15.41% in f1-score with 5K generated vulnerable samples on average, and 53.84%, 54.10%, 69.90%, and 40.93% with 15K generated vulnerable samples. Our approach demonstrates its feasibility for large-scale data augmentation by generating 1K samples at as cheap as US$ 1.88.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by TOSEM; 26 pages, 6 figures, 8 tables, 3 prompt templates, 1 algorithm</p></details> |

These systems face challenges in understanding and generating authentic Cantonese colloquial expressions due to limited annotated data and linguistic variability. The review evaluates the integration of LoRA within RAG frameworks, benchmarks PEFT methods for retrieval and generation accuracy, identify domain adaptation strategies under limited data, and compares fine-tuning techniques aimed at improving semantic fidelity under data-scarce conditions. A systematic analysis of recent studies employing diverse LoRA variants, synthetic data generation, user feedback integration, and adaptive parameter allocation was conducted to assess their impact on computational efficiency, retrieval precision, linguistic authenticity, and scalability. Findings reveal that dynamic and ensemble LoRA adaptations significantly reduce trainable parameters without sacrificing retrieval accuracy and generation quality in dialectal contexts. However, limitations remain in fully preserving fine-grained linguistic nuances, especially for low-resource settings like Cantonese. The integration of real-time user feedback and domain-specific data remains underdeveloped, limiting model adaptability and personalization. While selective parameter freezing and nonlinear adaptation methods offer better trade-offs between efficiency and accuracy, their robustness at scale remains an open challenge. This review highlights the promise of PEFT-enhanced RAG systems for domain-specific language tasks and calls for future work targeting dialectal authenticity, dynamic adaptation, and scalable fine-tuning pipelines.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 1 figure, 8 tables</p></details> |

These limitations manifest as two key challenges: pervasive misinformation in the web environment, which introduces unreliable or misleading content that can degrade retrieval accuracy, and the underutilization of web tools, which, if effectively employed, could enhance query precision and help mitigate this noise, ultimately improving the retrieval results in RAG systems. To address these issues, we propose WebFilter, a novel RAG framework that generates source-restricted queries and filters out unreliable content. This approach combines a retrieval filtering mechanism with a behavior- and outcome-driven reward strategy, optimizing both query formulation and retrieval outcomes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that WebFilter improves answer quality and retrieval precision, outperforming existing RAG methods on both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

However, user understanding, practices and expectations regarding these memory systems are not yet well understood. This paper presents a thematic analysis of semi-structured interviews with 18 users to explore their mental models of LLM's Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)-based memory, current usage practices, perceived benefits and drawbacks, privacy concerns and expectations for future memory systems. Our findings reveal diverse and often incomplete mental models of how memory operates. While users appreciate the potential for enhanced personalization and efficiency, significant concerns exist regarding privacy, control and the accuracy of remembered information. Users express a desire for granular control over memory generation, management, usage and updating, including clear mechanisms for reviewing, editing, deleting and categorizing memories, as well as transparent insight into how memories and inferred information are used. We discuss design implications for creating more user-centric, transparent, and trustworthy LLM memory systems.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods primarily focus on improving retrieval and rely on large language models (LLMs) to implicitly integrate the retrieved context with the query. However, such models are often sensitive to retrieval quality and may generate responses that are misaligned with user preferences. To address this limitation, we propose PrLM, a reinforcement learning framework that trains LLMs to explicitly reason over retrieved user profiles. Guided by a contrastively trained personalization reward model, PrLM effectively learns from user responses without requiring annotated reasoning paths. Experiments on three personalized text generation datasets show that PrLM outperforms existing methods and remains robust across varying numbers of retrieved profiles and different retrievers.</p></details> |  |

We present classification using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which shifts traditional classification tasks from determining the correct category in accordance with pre-trained parameters to evaluating content in relation to contextual knowledge retrieved at inference. In hate speech detection, this transforms the task from "is this hate speech?" to "does this violate the hate speech policy?" Our Contextual Policy Engine (CPE) - an agentic RAG system - demonstrates this approach and offers three key advantages: (1) robust classification accuracy comparable to leading commercial systems, (2) inherent explainability via retrieved policy segments, and (3) dynamic policy updates without model retraining. Through three experiments, we demonstrate strong baseline performance and show that the system can apply fine-grained policy control by correctly adjusting protection for specific identity groups without requiring retraining or compromising overall performance. These findings establish that RAG can transform classification into a more flexible, transparent, and adaptable process for content moderation and wider classification problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[You Don't Need Pre-built Graphs for RAG: Retrieval Augmented Generation with Adaptive Reasoning Structures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06105v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) often suffer from hallucination, generating factually incorrect statements when handling questions beyond their knowledge and perception. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) addresses this by retrieving query-relevant contexts from knowledge bases to support LLM reasoning. Recent advances leverage pre-constructed graphs to capture the relational connections among distributed documents, showing remarkable performance in complex tasks. However, existing Graph-based RAG (GraphRAG) methods rely on a costly process to transform the corpus into a graph, introducing overwhelming token cost and update latency. Moreover, real-world queries vary in type and complexity, requiring different logic structures for accurate reasoning. The pre-built graph may not align with these required structures, resulting in ineffective knowledge retrieval. To this end, we propose a \textbf{\underline{Logic}}-aware \textbf{\underline{R}}etrieval-\textbf{\underline{A}}ugmented \textbf{\underline{G}}eneration framework (\textbf{LogicRAG}) that dynamically extracts reasoning structures at inference time to guide adaptive retrieval without any pre-built graph. LogicRAG begins by decomposing the input query into a set of subproblems and constructing a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to model the logical dependencies among them. To support coherent multi-step reasoning, LogicRAG then linearizes the graph using topological sort, so that subproblems can be addressed in a logically consistent order. Besides, LogicRAG applies graph pruning to reduce redundant retrieval and uses context pruning to filter irrelevant context, significantly reducing the overall token cost. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LogicRAG achieves both superior performance and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |

While GraphRAG has shown promise for multi-hop reasoning and structured retrieval, its adoption has been limited by the high computational cost of constructing knowledge graphs using large language models (LLMs) and the latency of graph-based retrieval. To address these challenges, we introduce two core innovations: (1) a dependency-based knowledge graph construction pipeline that leverages industrial-grade NLP libraries to extract entities and relations from unstructured text completely eliminating reliance on LLMs; and (2) a lightweight graph retrieval strategy that combines hybrid query node identification with efficient one-hop traversal for high-recall, low-latency subgraph extraction. We evaluate our framework on two SAP datasets focused on legacy code migration and demonstrate strong empirical performance. Our system achieves up to 15% and 4.35% improvements over traditional RAG baselines based on LLM-as-Judge and RAGAS metrics, respectively. Moreover, our dependency-based construction approach attains 94% of the performance of LLM-generated knowledge graphs (61.87% vs. 65.83%) while significantly reducing cost and improving scalability. These results validate the feasibility of deploying GraphRAG systems in real-world, large-scale enterprise applications without incurring prohibitive resource requirements paving the way for practical, explainable, and domain-adaptable retrieval-augmented reasoning.</p></details> |  |

We introduce RankArena, a unified platform for comparing and analysing the performance of retrieval pipelines, rerankers, and RAG systems using structured human and LLM-based feedback as well as for collecting such feedback. RankArena supports multiple evaluation modes: direct reranking visualisation, blind pairwise comparisons with human or LLM voting, supervised manual document annotation, and end-to-end RAG answer quality assessment. It captures fine-grained relevance feedback through both pairwise preferences and full-list annotations, along with auxiliary metadata such as movement metrics, annotation time, and quality ratings. The platform also integrates LLM-as-a-judge evaluation, enabling comparison between model-generated rankings and human ground truth annotations. All interactions are stored as structured evaluation datasets that can be used to train rerankers, reward models, judgment agents, or retrieval strategy selectors. Our platform is publicly available at https://rankarena.ngrok.io/, and the Demo video is provided https://youtu.be/jIYAP4PaSSI.</p></details> | Accept at CIKM 2025 |

Despite impressive advancements, vanilla RAG-based VQA methods that rely on unstructured documents and overlook the structural relationships among knowledge elements frequently introduce irrelevant or misleading content, reducing answer accuracy and reliability. To overcome these challenges, a promising solution is to integrate multimodal knowledge graphs (KGs) into RAG-based VQA frameworks to enhance the generation by introducing structured multimodal knowledge. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel multimodal knowledge-augmented generation framework (mKG-RAG) based on multimodal KGs for knowledge-intensive VQA tasks. Specifically, our approach leverages MLLM-powered keyword extraction and vision-text matching to distill semantically consistent and modality-aligned entities/relationships from multimodal documents, constructing high-quality multimodal KGs as structured knowledge representations. In addition, a dual-stage retrieval strategy equipped with a question-aware multimodal retriever is introduced to improve retrieval efficiency while refining precision. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods, setting a new state-of-the-art for knowledge-based VQA.</p></details> |  |

However, existing RAG methods typically retrieve from either text or images in isolation, limiting their ability to address complex queries that require multi-hop reasoning or up-to-date factual knowledge. To address this limitation, we propose QA-Dragon, a Query-Aware Dynamic RAG System for Knowledge-Intensive VQA. Specifically, QA-Dragon introduces a domain router to identify the query's subject domain for domain-specific reasoning, along with a search router that dynamically selects optimal retrieval strategies. By orchestrating both text and image search agents in a hybrid setup, our system supports multimodal, multi-turn, and multi-hop reasoning, enabling it to tackle complex VQA tasks effectively. We evaluate our QA-Dragon on the Meta CRAG-MM Challenge at KDD Cup 2025, where it significantly enhances the reasoning performance of base models under challenging scenarios. Our framework achieves substantial improvements in both answer accuracy and knowledge overlap scores, outperforming baselines by 5.06% on the single-source task, 6.35% on the multi-source task, and 5.03% on the multi-turn task.</p></details> | <details><summary>The s...</summary><p>The source code for our system is released in https://github.com/jzzzzh/QA-Dragon</p></details> |

Despite efforts to address challenges such as scaling model size and data volume, the cost associated with pre-training and fine-tuning remains substantial. However, pre-trained large multimodal models (LMMs) encounter a modality gap, characterised by a misalignment between textual and visual representations within a common embedding space. Although fine-tuning can potentially mitigate this gap, it is typically expensive and impractical due to the requirement for extensive domain-driven data. To overcome this challenge, we propose a lightweight training-free approach utilising Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to extend across the modality using a linear mapping, which can be computed efficiently. During inference, this mapping is applied to images embedded by an LMM enabling retrieval of closest textual descriptions from the training set. These textual descriptions, in conjunction with an instruction, cater as an input prompt for the language model to generate new textual descriptions. In addition, we introduce an iterative technique for distilling the mapping by generating synthetic descriptions via the language model facilitating optimisation for standard utilised image description measures. Experimental results on two benchmark multimodal datasets demonstrate significant improvements.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM CIKM 2025. 5 pages, 2 figures</p></details> |
| **[PAIRS: Parametric-Verified Adaptive Information Retrieval and Selection for Efficient RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04057v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a cornerstone technique for enhancing large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge. However, current RAG systems face two critical limitations: (1) they inefficiently retrieve information for every query, including simple questions that could be resolved using the LLM's parametric knowledge alone, and (2) they risk retrieving irrelevant documents when queries contain sparse information signals. To address these gaps, we introduce Parametric-verified Adaptive Information Retrieval and Selection (PAIRS), a training-free framework that integrates parametric and retrieved knowledge to adaptively determine whether to retrieve and how to select external information. Specifically, PAIRS employs a dual-path generation mechanism: First, the LLM produces both a direct answer and a context-augmented answer using self-generated pseudo-context. When these outputs converge, PAIRS bypasses external retrieval entirely, dramatically improving the RAG system's efficiency. For divergent cases, PAIRS activates a dual-path retrieval (DPR) process guided by both the original query and self-generated contextual signals, followed by an Adaptive Information Selection (AIS) module that filters documents through weighted similarity to both sources. This simple yet effective approach can not only enhance efficiency by eliminating unnecessary retrievals but also improve accuracy through contextually guided retrieval and adaptive information selection. Experimental results on six question-answering (QA) benchmarks show that PAIRS reduces retrieval costs by around 25% (triggering for only 75% of queries) while still improving accuracy-achieving +1.1% EM and +1.0% F1 over prior baselines on average.</p></details> |  |
| **[MetaGen Blended RAG: Unlocking Zero-Shot Precision for Specialized Domain Question-Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18247v3)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) struggles with domain-specific enterprise datasets, often isolated behind firewalls and rich in complex, specialized terminology unseen by LLMs during pre-training. Semantic variability across domains like medicine, networking, or law hampers RAG's context precision, while fine-tuning solutions are costly, slow, and lack generalization as new data emerges. Achieving zero-shot precision with retrievers without fine-tuning still remains a key challenge. We introduce 'MetaGen Blended RAG', a novel enterprise search approach that enhances semantic retrievers through a metadata generation pipeline and hybrid query indexes using dense and sparse vectors. By leveraging key concepts, topics, and acronyms, our method creates metadata-enriched semantic indexes and boosted hybrid queries, delivering robust, scalable performance without fine-tuning. On the biomedical PubMedQA dataset, MetaGen Blended RAG achieves 82% retrieval accuracy and 77% RAG accuracy, surpassing all prior zero-shot RAG benchmarks and even rivaling fine-tuned models on that dataset, while also excelling on datasets like SQuAD and NQ. This approach redefines enterprise search using a new approach to building semantic retrievers with unmatched generalization across specialized domains.</p></details> |  |

| **[Token-Level Precise Attack on RAG: Searching for the Best Alternatives to Mislead Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03110v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in providing trustworthy responses for knowledge-intensive tasks, they still face critical limitations such as hallucinations and outdated knowledge. To address these issues, the retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework enhances LLMs with access to external knowledge via a retriever, enabling more accurate and real-time outputs about the latest events. However, this integration brings new security vulnerabilities: the risk that malicious content in the external database can be retrieved and used to manipulate model outputs. Although prior work has explored attacks on RAG systems, existing approaches either rely heavily on access to the retriever or fail to jointly consider both retrieval and generation stages, limiting their effectiveness, particularly in black-box scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose Token-level Precise Attack on the RAG (TPARAG), a novel framework that targets both white-box and black-box RAG systems. TPARAG leverages a lightweight white-box LLM as an attacker to generate and iteratively optimize malicious passages at the token level, ensuring both retrievability and high attack success in generation. Extensive experiments on open-domain QA datasets demonstrate that TPARAG consistently outperforms previous approaches in retrieval-stage and end-to-end attack effectiveness. These results further reveal critical vulnerabilities in RAG pipelines and offer new insights into improving their robustness.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Multi-Round Diagnostic RAG Framework for Emulating Clinical Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07724v2)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, accurately and quickly deploying medical large language models (LLMs) has become a trend. Among these, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has garnered attention due to rapid deployment and privacy protection. However, the challenge hinder the practical deployment of RAG for medical diagnosis: the semantic gap between colloquial patient descriptions and the professional terminology within medical knowledge bases. We try to address the challenge from the data perspective and the method perspective. First, to address the semantic gap in existing knowledge bases, we construct DiagnosGraph, a generalist knowledge graph covering both modern medicine and Traditional Chinese Medicine. It contains 876 common diseases with the graph of 7,997 nodes and 37,201 triples. To bridge the gap between colloquial patient narratives and academic medical knowledge, DiagnosGraph also introduces $1,908$ medical record by formalizing the patient chief complaint and proposing a medical diagnosis. Second, we introduce the Multi-Round Diagnostic RAG (MRD-RAG) framework. It utilizes a multi-round dialogue to refine diagnostic possibilities, emulating the clinical reasoning of a physician. Experiments conducted on four medical benchmarks, with evaluations by human physicians, demonstrate that MRD-RAG enhances the diagnostic performance of LLMs, highlighting its potential to make automated diagnosis more accurate and human-aligned.</p></details> |  |
| **[Highlight & Summarize: RAG without the jailbreaks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02872v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Preventing jailbreaking and model hijacking of Large Language Models (LLMs) is an important yet challenging task. For example, when interacting with a chatbot, malicious users can input specially crafted prompts to cause the LLM to generate undesirable content or perform a completely different task from its intended purpose. Existing mitigations for such attacks typically rely on hardening the LLM's system prompt or using a content classifier trained to detect undesirable content or off-topic conversations. However, these probabilistic approaches are relatively easy to bypass due to the very large space of possible inputs and undesirable outputs. In this paper, we present and evaluate Highlight & Summarize (H&S), a new design pattern for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems that prevents these attacks by design. The core idea is to perform the same task as a standard RAG pipeline (i.e., to provide natural language answers to questions, based on relevant sources) without ever revealing the user's question to the generative LLM. This is achieved by splitting the pipeline into two components: a highlighter, which takes the user's question and extracts relevant passages ("highlights") from the retrieved documents, and a summarizer, which takes the highlighted passages and summarizes them into a cohesive answer. We describe several possible instantiations of H&S and evaluate their generated responses in terms of correctness, relevance, and response quality. Surprisingly, when using an LLM-based highlighter, the majority of H&S responses are judged to be better than those of a standard RAG pipeline.</p></details> |  |

One such domain is software development, where researchers have pushed the automation of a number of code tasks through LLM agents. Software development is a complex ecosystem, that stretches far beyond code implementation and well into the realm of code maintenance. In this paper, we propose a multi-agent system to localize bugs in large pre-existing codebases using information retrieval and LLMs. Our system introduces a novel Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approach, Meta-RAG, where we utilize summaries to condense codebases by an average of 79.8\%, into a compact, structured, natural language representation. We then use an LLM agent to determine which parts of the codebase are critical for bug resolution, i.e. bug localization. We demonstrate the usefulness of Meta-RAG through evaluation with the SWE-bench Lite dataset. Meta-RAG scores 84.67 % and 53.0 % for file-level and function-level correct localization rates, respectively, achieving state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we evaluate four methodologies for Out-Of-Domain (OOD) query detection: GPT-4o, regression-based, Principal Component Analysis (PCA)-based, and Neural Collapse (NC), to ensure the RAG system only responds to queries confined to the system's knowledge base. Specifically, our evaluation explores two novel dimensionality reduction and feature separation strategies: \textit{PCA}, where top components are selected using explained variance or OOD separability, and an adaptation of \textit{Neural Collapse Feature Separation}. We validate our approach on standard datasets (StackExchange and MSMARCO) and real-world applications (Substance Use and COVID-19), including tests against LLM-simulated and actual attacks on a COVID-19 vaccine chatbot. Through human and LLM-based evaluations of response correctness and relevance, we confirm that an external OOD detector is crucial for maintaining response relevance.</p></details> |  |

Although informative, this volume can lead to cognitive overload, making it difficult for users to quickly and accurately find the information they need. Existing Product Question Answering (PQA) systems often fail to utilize rich user context and diverse product information effectively. We propose a scalable, end-to-end framework for e-commerce PQA using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) that deeply integrates contextual understanding. Our system leverages conversational history, user profiles, and product attributes to deliver relevant and personalized answers. It adeptly handles objective, subjective, and multi-intent queries across heterogeneous sources, while also identifying information gaps in the catalog to support ongoing content improvement. We also introduce novel metrics to measure the framework's performance which are broadly applicable for RAG system evaluations.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 1 figure, 5 tables.

We present PunGPT2, the first fully open-source suite of Punjabi large language models, trained from scratch on a 35GB domain-diverse corpus encompassing literature, religious texts, news, and social discourse. Unlike prior multilingual approaches, PunGPT2 captures rich syntactic and morphological features unique to Punjabi through a tokenizer optimised with byte pair encoding and linguistically aligned pretraining objectives. To improve factual grounding and domain recall, we introduce Pun-RAG, a retrieval-augmented generation framework combining PunGPT2 with a dense FAISS retriever over a curated Punjabi knowledge base. We further develop Pun-Instruct, a parameter-efficient, instruction-tuned variant using QLoRA, enabling robust zero-shot and instruction-following performance with significantly reduced compute needs. As a key innovation, we propose Quantum-RAG, a novel hybrid retrieval system that fuses sparse (BM25) and dense methods with quantum-inspired semantic matching. By encoding queries using amplitude-based embeddings and retrieving via quantum kernel similarity, Quantum-RAG achieves improved contextual relevance with minimal memory overhead marking the first practical integration of quantum representations in low-resource language generation. Our models significantly outperform strong multilingual baselines (mBERT, mT5, MuRIL) in perplexity, factuality, and fluency. This work provides a scalable, reproducible blueprint for extending LLM capabilities to underrepresented languages and pioneers quantum-aware retrieval in low-resource NLP</p></details> |  |
| **[Validating Pharmacogenomics Generative Artificial Intelligence Query Prompts Using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21453v2)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study evaluated Sherpa Rx, an artificial intelligence tool leveraging large language models and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for pharmacogenomics, to validate its performance on key response metrics. Sherpa Rx integrated Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) guidelines with Pharmacogenomics Knowledgebase (PharmGKB) data to generate contextually relevant responses. A dataset (N=260 queries) spanning 26 CPIC guidelines was used to evaluate drug-gene interactions, dosing recommendations, and therapeutic implications. In Phase 1, only CPIC data was embedded. Phase 2 additionally incorporated PharmGKB content. Responses were scored on accuracy, relevance, clarity, completeness (5-point Likert scale), and recall. Wilcoxon signed-rank tests compared accuracy between Phase 1 and Phase 2, and between Phase 2 and ChatGPT-4omini. A 20-question quiz assessed the tool's real-world applicability against other models. In Phase 1 (N=260), Sherpa Rx demonstrated high performance of accuracy 4.9, relevance 5.0, clarity 5.0, completeness 4.8, and recall 0.99. The subset analysis (N=20) showed improvements in accuracy (4.6 vs. 4.4, Phase 2 vs. Phase 1 subset) and completeness (5.0 vs. 4.8). ChatGPT-4omini performed comparably in relevance (5.0) and clarity (4.9) but lagged in accuracy (3.9) and completeness (4.2). Differences in accuracy between Phase 1 and Phase 2 was not statistically significant. However, Phase 2 significantly outperformed ChatGPT-4omini. On the 20-question quiz, Sherpa Rx achieved 90% accuracy, outperforming other models. Integrating additional resources like CPIC and PharmGKB with RAG enhances AI accuracy and performance. This study highlights the transformative potential of generative AI like Sherpa Rx in pharmacogenomics, improving decision-making with accurate, personalized responses.</p></details> |  |

Among completion tasks, Method Body Completion (MBC) is particularly challenging as it involves generating complete method bodies based on their signatures and context. This task becomes significantly harder in large repositories, where method bodies must integrate repositoryspecific elements such as custom APIs, inter-module dependencies, and project-specific conventions. In this paper, we introduce RAMBO, a novel RAG-based approach for repository-level MBC. Instead of retrieving similar method bodies, RAMBO identifies essential repository-specific elements, such as classes, methods, and variables/fields, and their relevant usages. By incorporating these elements and their relevant usages into the code generation process, RAMBO ensures more accurate and contextually relevant method bodies. Our experimental results with leading code LLMs across 40 Java projects show that RAMBO significantly outperformed the state-of-the-art repository-level MBC approaches, with the improvements of up to 46% in BLEU, 57% in CodeBLEU, 36% in Compilation Rate, and up to 3X in Exact Match. Notably, RAMBO surpassed RepoCoder Oracle method by up to 12% in Exact Match, setting a new benchmark for repository-level MBC.</p></details> |  |

While previous approaches in the Indian context have relied on internal case content such as facts, issues, and reasoning, they often overlook a core element of common law systems, which is reliance on statutory provisions and judicial precedents. In this work, we propose NyayaRAG, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework that simulates realistic courtroom scenarios by providing models with factual case descriptions, relevant legal statutes, and semantically retrieved prior cases. NyayaRAG evaluates the effectiveness of these combined inputs in predicting court decisions and generating legal explanations using a domain-specific pipeline tailored to the Indian legal system. We assess performance across various input configurations using both standard lexical and semantic metrics as well as LLM-based evaluators such as G-Eval. Our results show that augmenting factual inputs with structured legal knowledge significantly improves both predictive accuracy and explanation quality.</p></details> |  |

Reinforcement learning offers a way to model sequential decision-making through dynamic programming to anticipate future environmental changes. However, applying multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to decentralized combinatorial optimization problems remains an open challenge due to the exponential growth of the joint state-action space, high communication overhead, and privacy concerns in centralized training. To address these limitations, this paper proposes Hierarchical Reinforcement and Collective Learning (HRCL), a novel approach that leverages both MARL and decentralized collective learning based on a hierarchical framework. Agents take high-level strategies using MARL to group possible plans for action space reduction and constrain the agent behavior for Pareto optimality. Meanwhile, the low-level collective learning layer ensures efficient and decentralized coordinated decisions among agents with minimal communication. Extensive experiments in a synthetic scenario and real-world smart city application models, including energy self-management and drone swarm sensing, demonstrate that HRCL significantly improves performance, scalability, and adaptability compared to the standalone MARL and collective learning approaches, achieving a win-win synthesis solution.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

Knowledge Graphs (KGs) provide structured external knowledge, yet their complexity and multi-hop reasoning requirements make integration challenging. We present ARK-V1, a simple KG-agent that iteratively explores graphs to answer natural language queries. We evaluate several not fine-tuned state-of-the art LLMs as backbones for ARK-V1 on the CoLoTa dataset, which requires both KG-based and commonsense reasoning over long-tail entities. ARK-V1 achieves substantially higher conditional accuracies than Chain-of-Thought baselines, and larger backbone models show a clear trend toward better coverage, correctness, and stability.</p></details> | Work in Progess |

Recent advances in large language model (LLM) agents open new opportunities for human-LLM-agent collaboration by enabling natural communication and various social and cognitive behaviors. Yet it remains unclear whether principles of computer-mediated collaboration established in HCI and CSCW persist, change, or fail when humans collaborate with LLM agents. To support systematic investigations of these questions, we introduce an open and configurable research platform for HCI researchers. The platform's modular design allows seamless adaptation of classic CSCW experiments and manipulation of theory-grounded interaction controls. We demonstrate the platform's effectiveness and usability through two case studies: (1) re-implementing the classic human-human-collaboration task Shape Factory as a between-subject human-agent-collaboration experiment with 16 participants, and (2) a participatory cognitive walkthrough with five HCI researchers to refine workflows and interfaces for experiment setup and analysis.</p></details> |  |

This "illusion of thinking" is frequently an artifact of non-agentic, black-box evaluation paradigms that fail to cultivate robust problem-solving processes. In response, we introduce The STAR-XAI Protocol (Socratic, Transparent, Agentic, Reasoning - for eXplainable Artificial Intelligence), a novel methodology for training and operating verifiably reliable AI agents. Our method reframes the human-AI interaction as a structured, Socratic dialogue, governed by an explicit and evolving rulebook, the Consciousness Transfer Package (CTP). Through an interactive Gameplay Cycle that enforces ante-hoc strategic justification and a state-locking Checksum that prevents error accumulation, the protocol transforms a powerful but opaque LRM into a disciplined "Clear Box" agent. We demonstrate the efficacy of this method through an exhaustive 25-move case study in the complex strategic game "Caps i Caps". The agent not only solved the high-complexity puzzle but also demonstrated Second-Order Agency, identifying flaws in its own supervisor-approved plans and adapting its core integrity protocols mid-task. The STAR-XAI Protocol offers a practical pathway to creating AI agents that are not just high-performing, but also transparent, auditable, and trustworthy by design.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper 1 of 4 in The STAR-XAI Protocol series.

In this paper, we introduce Orcust, a framework that integrates Principle-Constrained Reward Modeling (PCRM) and Online VM-Grounded Trajectory Construction (OVTC) to enhance reasoning reliability and data efficiency in interactive GUI tasks. We leverages environment-verifiable and LLM-derived principle to enforce interpretable reward signals that constrain long chain-of-thought reasoning and rule-based feedback. OVTC spins up instrumented virtual machines to autonomously collect structured GUI interaction trajectories with explicit procedural and structural objectives, enabling the training of a stepwise reward model that robustly captures human preferences and adheres to task-specific constraints. Extensive experiments on standard GUI benchmarks covering perceptual grounding, foundational operations, and end-to-end task execution reveal that Orcust achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving by 22.2\% on ScreenSpot and 23.9\% on ScreenSpot-Pro over the base model (i.e. Qwen2.5-VL-7B). The results demonstrate Orcust's effectiveness in enhancing the reasoning, adaptability and scalability of GUI agents across various environments and task complexities.</p></details> |  |

This paper focuses on comparing novel agent system designs that use modular agents to analyze laboratory results, vital signs, and clinical context, and to predict and validate results. We implement our agent system with the eICU database, including running lab analysis, vitals-only interpreters, and contextual reasoners agents first, then sharing the memory into the integration agent, prediction agent, transparency agent, and a validation agent. Our results suggest that the multi-agent system (MAS) performed better than the single-agent system (SAS) with mortality prediction accuracy (59\%, 56\%) and the mean error for length of stay (LOS)(4.37 days, 5.82 days), respectively. However, the transparency score for the SAS (86.21) is slightly better than the transparency score for MAS (85.5). Finally, this study suggests that our agent-based framework not only improves process transparency and prediction accuracy but also strengthens trustworthy AI-assisted decision support in an intensive care setting.</p></details> |  |

Moreover, legal interpretation is rarely straightforward-ambiguity is pervasive, and judgments often hinge on subjective assessments. Compounding these challenges, contracts are usually confidential, restricting their use with proprietary models and necessitating reliance on open-source alternatives. To address these challenges, we introduce PAKTON: a fully open-source, end-to-end, multi-agent framework with plug-and-play capabilities. PAKTON is designed to handle the complexities of contract analysis through collaborative agent workflows and a novel retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) component, enabling automated legal document review that is more accessible, adaptable, and privacy-preserving. Experiments demonstrate that PAKTON outperforms both general-purpose and pretrained models in predictive accuracy, retrieval performance, explainability, completeness, and grounded justifications as evaluated through a human study and validated with automated metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP 2025</p></details> |

Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting induces significant latency due to multi-turn reasoning; per-account fine-tuning is computationally prohibitive; and long prompt-based methods degrade the model's ability to grasp injected context and style. In this paper, we propose WeStar, a lite-adaptive framework for stylized contextual question answering that scales to millions of official accounts. WeStar combines context-grounded generation via RAG with style-aware generation using Parametric RAG (PRAG), where LoRA modules are dynamically activated per style cluster. Our contributions are fourfold: (1) We introduce WeStar, a unified framework capable of serving large volumes of official accounts with minimal overhead. (2) We propose a multi-dimensional, cluster-based parameter sharing scheme that enables compact style representation while preserving stylistic diversity. (3) We develop a style-enhanced Direct Preference Optimization (SeDPO) method to optimize each style cluster's parameters for improved generation quality. (4) Experiments on a large-scale industrial dataset validate the effectiveness and efficiency of WeStar, underscoring its pracitical value in real-world deployment.</p></details> | 7 pages |
| **[A Large Language Model-based multi-agent manufacturing system for intelligent shopfloor](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16887v2)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As customer demand for multi-variety and small-batch production increases, dynamic disturbances place greater demands on manufacturing systems. To address such challenges, researchers proposed the multi-agent manufacturing system. However, conventional agent negotiation typically relies on pre-defined and fixed heuristic rules, which are ill-suited to managing complex and fluctuating disturbances. In current implementations, mainstream approaches based on reinforcement learning require the development of simulators and training models specific to a given shopfloor, necessitating substantial computational resources and lacking scalability. To overcome this limitation, the present study proposes a Large Language Model-based (LLM-based) multi-agent manufacturing system for intelligent shopfloor management. By defining the diverse modules of agents and their collaborative methods, this system facilitates the processing of all workpieces with minimal human intervention. The agents in this system consist of the Machine Server Module (MSM), Bid Inviter Module (BIM), Bidder Module (BM), Thinking Module (TM), and Decision Module (DM). By harnessing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, these modules enable agents to dynamically analyze shopfloor information and select appropriate processing machines. The LLM-based modules, predefined by system prompts, provide dynamic functionality for the system without the need for pre-training. Extensive experiments were conducted in physical shopfloor settings. The results demonstrate that the proposed system exhibits strong adaptability, and achieves superior performance (makespan) and stability (as measured by sample standard deviation) compared to other approaches without requiring pre-training.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Agent Amodal Completion: Direct Synthesis with Fine-Grained Semantic Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17757v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Amodal completion, generating invisible parts of occluded objects, is vital for applications like image editing and AR. Prior methods face challenges with data needs, generalization, or error accumulation in progressive pipelines. We propose a Collaborative Multi-Agent Reasoning Framework based on upfront collaborative reasoning to overcome these issues. Our framework uses multiple agents to collaboratively analyze occlusion relationships and determine necessary boundary expansion, yielding a precise mask for inpainting. Concurrently, an agent generates fine-grained textual descriptions, enabling Fine-Grained Semantic Guidance. This ensures accurate object synthesis and prevents the regeneration of occluders or other unwanted elements, especially within large inpainting areas. Furthermore, our method directly produces layered RGBA outputs guided by visible masks and attention maps from a Diffusion Transformer, eliminating extra segmentation. Extensive evaluations demonstrate our framework achieves state-of-the-art visual quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[An LLM-based Agent Simulation Approach to Study Moral Evolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17703v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The evolution of morality presents a puzzle: natural selection should favor self-interest, yet humans developed moral systems promoting altruism. We address this question by introducing a novel Large Language Model (LLM)-based agent simulation framework modeling prehistoric hunter-gatherer societies. This platform is designed to probe diverse questions in social evolution, from survival advantages to inter-group dynamics. To investigate moral evolution, we designed agents with varying moral dispositions based on the Expanding Circle Theory \citep{singer1981expanding}. We evaluated their evolutionary success across a series of simulations and analyzed their decision-making in specially designed moral dilemmas. These experiments reveal how an agent's moral framework, in combination with its cognitive constraints, directly shapes its behavior and determines its evolutionary outcome. Crucially, the emergent patterns echo seminal theories from related domains of social science, providing external validation for the simulations. This work establishes LLM-based simulation as a powerful new paradigm to complement traditional research in evolutionary biology and anthropology, opening new avenues for investigating the complexities of moral and social evolution.</p></details> |  |

However, achieving high energy efficiency in such networks remains a critical challenge, particularly in large-scale or dynamically changing environments. Traditional terrestrial LoRa deployments often suffer from coverage gaps and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) propagation losses, while satellite-based IoT solutions consume excessive energy and introduce high latency, limiting their suitability for energy-constrained and delay-sensitive applications. To address these limitations, we propose a novel architecture using multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as flying LoRa gateways to dynamically collect data from ground-based LoRa end devices. Our approach aims to maximize the system's weighted global energy efficiency by jointly optimizing spreading factors, transmission powers, UAV trajectories, and end-device associations. Additionally, we formulate this complex optimization problem as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) and propose green LoRa multi-agent proximal policy optimization (GLo-MAPPO), a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework based on centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE). Simulation results show that GLo-MAPPO significantly outperforms benchmark algorithms, achieving energy efficiency improvements of 71.25%, 18.56%, 67.00%, 59.73%, and 49.95% for networks with 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 LoRa end devices, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 19 figures, journal</p></details> |

However, their reasoning and coordination capabilities in complex, multi-stage scenarios remain underexplored. Existing benchmarks typically focus on isolated tasks or narrow domains, overlooking models' abilities for multi-stage collaboration and optimization without explicit external guidance. To bridge this gap, we propose \textbf{MSCoRe}, a novel benchmark comprising 126696 domain-specific QA instances spanning scenarios in automotive, pharmaceutical, electronics, and energy sectors. The dataset is created using a structured three-phase pipeline: dynamic sampling, iterative question-answer generation, and a multi-level quality assessment to ensure data quality. Tasks are further categorized into three difficulty levels according to stage coverage and complexity. With MSCoRe, we have conducted a comprehensive evaluation of various state-of-the-art LLM agents. The commercial models performed best across all tasks and scenarios, but a notable gap in ROUGE scores remains between simple and complex tasks. We also tested the models' robustness and found that their performance is negatively affected by noisy data. MSCoRe provides a valuable new resource for the community to evaluate and improve multi-stage reasoning in LLM agents. The code and data are available at https://github.com/D3E0-source/MSCoRE.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Comparing Data Assimilation and Likelihood-Based Inference on Latent State Estimation in Agent-Based Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17625v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we present the first systematic comparison of Data Assimilation (DA) and Likelihood-Based Inference (LBI) in the context of Agent-Based Models (ABMs). These models generate observable time series driven by evolving, partially-latent microstates. Latent states need to be estimated to align simulations with real-world data -- a task traditionally addressed by DA, especially in continuous and equation-based models such as those used in weather forecasting. However, the nature of ABMs poses challenges for standard DA methods. Solving such issues requires adaptation of previous DA techniques, or ad-hoc alternatives such as LBI. DA approximates the likelihood in a model-agnostic way, making it broadly applicable but potentially less precise. In contrast, LBI provides more accurate state estimation by directly leveraging the model's likelihood, but at the cost of requiring a hand-crafted, model-specific likelihood function, which may be complex or infeasible to derive. We compare the two methods on the Bounded-Confidence Model, a well-known opinion dynamics ABM, where agents are affected only by others holding sufficiently similar opinions. We find that LBI better recovers latent agent-level opinions, even under model mis-specification, leading to improved individual-level forecasts. At the aggregate level, however, both methods perform comparably, and DA remains competitive across levels of aggregation under certain parameter settings. Our findings suggest that DA is well-suited for aggregate predictions, while LBI is preferable for agent-level inference.</p></details> |  |

While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in generating synthetic conversations, the extent to which these agent-generated interactions can effectively substitute real human conversations remains unclear. This work presents the first systematic comparison between LLM-simulated users and human users in personalized task-oriented conversations. We propose a comprehensive analytical framework encompassing three key aspects (conversation strategy, interaction style, and conversation evaluation) and ten distinct dimensions for evaluating user behaviors, and collect parallel conversational datasets from both human users and LLM agent users across four representative scenarios under identical conditions. Our analysis reveals significant behavioral differences between the two user types in problem-solving approaches, question broadness, user engagement, context dependency, feedback polarity and promise, language style, and hallucination awareness. We found consistency in the agent users and human users across the depth-first or breadth-first dimensions, as well as the usefulness dimensions. These findings provide critical insights for advancing LLM-based user simulation. Our multi-dimensional taxonomy constructed a generalizable framework for analyzing user behavior patterns, offering insights from LLM agent users and human users. By this work, we provide perspectives on rethinking how to use user simulation in conversational systems in the future.</p></details> | SIGIR-AP 2025 |

Much public attention has been transfixed on the topic of code generation from Large Language Models (LLMs) via a prompt. However, software engineering is much more than programming, and AI agents go far beyond instructions given by a prompt. At the code level, common software tasks include code generation, testing, and program repair. Design level software tasks may include architecture exploration, requirements understanding, and requirements enforcement at the code level. Each of these software tasks involves micro-decisions which can be taken autonomously by an AI agent, aided by program analysis tools. This creates the vision of an AI software engineer, where the AI agent can be seen as a member of a development team. Conceptually, the key to successfully developing trustworthy agentic AI-based software workflows will be to resolve the core difficulty in software engineering - the deciphering and clarification of developer intent. Specification inference, or deciphering the intent, thus lies at the heart of many software tasks, including software maintenance and program repair. A successful deployment of agentic technology into software engineering would involve making conceptual progress in such intent inference via agents. Trusting the AI agent becomes a key aspect, as software engineering becomes more automated. Higher automation also leads to higher volume of code being automatically generated, and then integrated into code-bases. Thus to deal with this explosion, an emerging direction is AI-based verification and validation (V & V) of AI generated code. We posit that agentic software workflows in future will include such AIbased V&V.</p></details> | 4 pages |

Existing solutions struggle to bridge the gap between high level user intents and the low level, parameterized configurations required for optimal performance. To address this challenge, we propose RIDAS, a multi agent framework composed of representation driven agents (RDAs) and an intention driven agent (IDA). RDAs expose open interface with tunable control parameters (rank and quantization bits, enabling explicit trade) offs between distortion and transmission rate. The IDA employs a two stage planning scheme (bandwidth pre allocation and reallocation) driven by a large language model (LLM) to map user intents and system state into optimal RDA configurations. Experiments demonstrate that RIDAS supports 36.47% more users than WirelessAgent under equivalent QoS constraints. These results validate ability of RIDAS to capture user intent and allocate resources more efficiently in AI RAN environments.</p></details> | 6 pages, 7 figures |

We present MapCoder-Lite, which upgrades a single 7B model into four role-specialised agents-retriever, planner, coder, and debugger-using only rank-32, role-specific LoRA adapters ($<3\%$ extra parameters). Three lightweight techniques make this possible: (i) trajectory distillation from strong LLMs fixes format fragility in retrieval and debugging, (ii) supervisor-guided correction strengthens planning and coding agents, and (iii) agent-wise LoRA fine-tuning delivers memory-efficient specialisation. Comprehensive evaluation on xCodeEval, APPS, and CodeContests shows that MapCoder-Lite more than doubles xCodeEval accuracy (from $13.2\%$ to $28.3\%$), eliminates all format failures, and closes to within six points of a 32B baseline while cutting GPU memory and token-generation time by $4\times$. These results demonstrate that careful agent-wise fine-tuning unleashes high-quality multi-agent coding on a small language model.</p></details> |  |

While recent work reveals significant gaps between LLMs' privacy Q&A performance and their agent behavior, existing benchmarks remain limited to static, simplified scenarios. We present PrivacyChecker, a model-agnostic, contextual integrity based mitigation approach that effectively reduces privacy leakage from 36.08% to 7.30% on DeepSeek-R1 and from 33.06% to 8.32% on GPT-4o, all while preserving task helpfulness. We also introduce PrivacyLens-Live, transforming static benchmarks into dynamic MCP and A2A environments that reveal substantially higher privacy risks in practical. Our modular mitigation approach integrates seamlessly into agent protocols through three deployment strategies, providing practical privacy protection for the emerging agentic ecosystem.

However, existing approaches to strategy planning for proactive dialogue face several limitations: limited strategy coverage, preference bias in planning, and reliance on costly additional training. To address these, we propose PRINCIPLES: a synthetic strategy memory for proactive dialogue agents. PRINCIPLES is derived through offline self-play simulations and serves as reusable knowledge that guides strategy planning during inference, eliminating the need for additional training and data annotation. We evaluate PRINCIPLES in both emotional support and persuasion domains, demonstrating consistent improvements over strong baselines. Furthermore, PRINCIPLES maintains its robustness across extended and more diverse evaluation settings.

The advancement of multi-agent systems has further en-hanced the capabilities of LLMs. Inspired by the structure of multi-polar neurons (MNs), we propose the XAgents framework, an in-terpretable multi-agent cooperative framework based on the IF-THEN rule-based system. The IF-Parts of the rules are responsible for logical reasoning and domain membership calculation, while the THEN-Parts are comprised of domain expert agents that generate domain-specific contents. Following the calculation of the member-ship, XAgetns transmits the task to the disparate domain rules, which subsequently generate the various responses. These re-sponses are analogous to the answers provided by different experts to the same question. The final response is reached at by eliminat-ing the hallucinations and erroneous knowledge of the LLM through membership computation and semantic adversarial genera-tion of the various domain rules. The incorporation of rule-based interpretability serves to bolster user confidence in the XAgents framework. We evaluate the efficacy of XAgents through a com-parative analysis with the latest AutoAgents, in which XAgents demonstrated superior performance across three distinct datasets. We perform post-hoc interpretable studies with SHAP algorithm and case studies, proving the interpretability of XAgent in terms of input-output feature correlation and rule-based semantics.</p></details> | <details><summary>We in...</summary><p>We intend to substantially revise the problem statement and scope; therefore we withdraw the current version</p></details> |

Their ability to assume roles and personalities based on predefined character biographies has positioned them as cost-effective substitutes for human participants in social science research. This paper explores the validity of such persona-based agents in representing human populations; we recreate the HEXACO personality inventory experiment by surveying 310 GPT-4 powered agents, conducting factor analysis on their responses, and comparing these results to the original findings presented by Ashton, Lee, & Goldberg in 2004. Our results found 1) a coherent and reliable personality structure was recoverable from the agents' responses demonstrating partial alignment to the HEXACO framework. 2) the derived personality dimensions were consistent and reliable within GPT-4, when coupled with a sufficiently curated population, and 3) cross-model analysis revealed variability in personality profiling, suggesting model-specific biases and limitations. We discuss the practical considerations and challenges encountered during the experiment. This study contributes to the ongoing discourse on the potential benefits and limitations of using generative agents in social science research and provides useful guidance on designing consistent and representative agent personas to maximise coverage and representation of human personality traits.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-scale Temporal Prediction via Incremental Generation and Multi-agent Collaboration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17429v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate temporal prediction is the bridge between comprehensive scene understanding and embodied artificial intelligence. However, predicting multiple fine-grained states of a scene at multiple temporal scales is difficult for vision-language models. We formalize the Multi-Scale Temporal Prediction (MSTP) task in general and surgical scenes by decomposing multi-scale into two orthogonal dimensions: the temporal scale, forecasting states of humans and surgery at varying look-ahead intervals, and the state scale, modeling a hierarchy of states in general and surgical scenes. For example, in general scenes, states of contact relationships are finer-grained than states of spatial relationships. In surgical scenes, medium-level steps are finer-grained than high-level phases yet remain constrained by their encompassing phase. To support this unified task, we introduce the first MSTP Benchmark, featuring synchronized annotations across multiple state scales and temporal scales. We further propose a method, Incremental Generation and Multi-agent Collaboration (IG-MC), which integrates two key innovations. First, we present a plug-and-play incremental generation module that continuously synthesizes up-to-date visual previews at expanding temporal scales to inform multiple decision-making agents, keeping decisions and generated visuals synchronized and preventing performance degradation as look-ahead intervals lengthen. Second, we present a decision-driven multi-agent collaboration framework for multi-state prediction, comprising generation, initiation, and multi-state assessment agents that dynamically trigger and evaluate prediction cycles to balance global coherence and local fidelity.</p></details> | 20 pages, 6 figures |

To mitigate overconfidence and improve reliability, we introduce a safe debate protocol that enables agents to challenge and refine initial conclusions while preserving coherent recommendations.

To bridge this gap, we introduce ReasonMed, the largest medical reasoning dataset to date, comprising 370k high-quality examples distilled from 1.75 million initial reasoning paths generated by complementary LLMs and curated through a cost-efficient easy-medium-difficult (EMD) pipeline. ReasonMed is built through a multi-agent generation, verification, and refinement process, in which an Error Refiner improves reasoning paths by correcting error-prone steps identified by a verifier. Using ReasonMed, we investigate effective strategies for training medical reasoning models and find that integrating detailed CoT reasoning with concise answer summaries yields the most robust fine-tuning results. Models trained on ReasonMed set a new benchmark: ReasonMed-7B surpasses the prior best sub-10B models by 4.17% and even exceeds LLaMA3.1-70B on PubMedQA by 4.60%. When scaled to ReasonMed-14B, it remains highly competitive, underscoring consistent scaling potential.

However, research in this area has been severely hampered by the lack of large-scale, diverse datasets with precise, ground-truth error labels. To address this bottleneck, we introduce \textbf{AEGIS}, a novel framework for \textbf{A}utomated \textbf{E}rror \textbf{G}eneration and \textbf{I}dentification for Multi-Agent \textbf{S}ystems. By systematically injecting controllable and traceable errors into initially successful trajectories, we create a rich dataset of realistic failures. This is achieved using a context-aware, LLM-based adaptive manipulator that performs sophisticated attacks like prompt injection and response corruption to induce specific, predefined error modes. We demonstrate the value of our dataset by exploring three distinct learning paradigms for the error identification task: Supervised Fine-Tuning, Reinforcement Learning, and Contrastive Learning. Our comprehensive experiments show that models trained on AEGIS data achieve substantial improvements across all three learning paradigms. Notably, several of our fine-tuned models demonstrate performance competitive with or superior to proprietary systems an order of magnitude larger, validating our automated data generation framework as a crucial resource for developing more robust and interpretable multi-agent systems.

| **[Asteria: Semantic-Aware Cross-Region Caching for Agentic LLM Tool Access](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17360v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM) agents tackle data-intensive tasks such as deep research and code generation. However, their effectiveness depends on frequent interactions with knowledge sources across remote clouds or regions. Such interactions can create non-trivial latency and cost bottlenecks. Existing caching solutions focus on exact-match queries, limiting their effectiveness for semantic knowledge reuse. To address this challenge, we introduce Asteria, a novel cross-region knowledge caching architecture for LLM agents. At its core are two abstractions: Semantic Element (SE) and Semantic Retrieval Index (Sine). A semantic element captures the semantic embedding representation of an LLM query together with performance-aware metadata such as latency, cost, and staticity. Sine then provides two-stage retrieval: a vector similar index with semantic embedding for fast candidate selection and a lightweight LLM-powered semantic judger for precise validation. Atop these primitives, Asteria builds a new cache interface that includes a new semantic-aware cache hit definition, a cost-efficient eviction policy, and proactive prefetching. To reduce overhead, Asteria co-locates the small LLM judger with the main LLM using adaptive scheduling and resource sharing. Our evaluation demonstrates that Asteria delivers substantial performance improvements without compromising correctness. On representative search workloads, Asteria achieves up to a 3.6$\times$ increase in throughput by maintaining cache hit rates of over 85%, while preserving accuracy virtually identical to non-cached baselines. Asteria also improves throughput for complex coding tasks by 20%, showcasing its versatility across diverse agentic workloads.</p></details> |  |

We introduce a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that serves as both a benchmark and evaluation environment for multimodal clinical reasoning in the radiology ecosystem. The proposed framework integrates large language models (LLMs) and large vision models (LVMs) within a modular architecture composed of ten specialized agents responsible for image analysis, feature extraction, report generation, review, and evaluation. This design enables fine-grained assessment at both the agent level (e.g., detection and segmentation accuracy) and the consensus level (e.g., report quality and clinical relevance). We demonstrate an implementation using chatGPT-4o on public radiology datasets, where LLMs act as evaluators alongside medical radiologist feedback. By aligning evaluation protocols with the LLM development lifecycle, including pretraining, finetuning, alignment, and deployment, the proposed benchmark establishes a path toward trustworthy deviance-based radiology report generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS2025 Workshop: Evaluating the Evolving LLM Lifecycle: Benchmarks, Emergent Abilities, and Scaling</p></details> |

Central to these agents is the capability for GUI interaction, which involves GUI understanding and planning capabilities. Existing methods have tried developing GUI agents based on the multi-modal comprehension ability of vision-language models (VLMs). However, the limited scenario, insufficient size, and heterogeneous action spaces hinder the progress of building generalist GUI agents. To resolve these issues, this paper proposes \textbf{UIPro}, a novel generalist GUI agent trained with extensive multi-platform and multi-task GUI interaction data, coupled with a unified action space. We first curate a comprehensive dataset encompassing 20.6 million GUI understanding tasks to pre-train UIPro, granting it a strong GUI grounding capability, which is key to downstream GUI agent tasks. Subsequently, we establish a unified action space to harmonize heterogeneous GUI agent task datasets and produce a merged dataset to foster the action prediction ability of UIPro via continued fine-tuning. Experimental results demonstrate UIPro's superior performance across multiple GUI task benchmarks on various platforms, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025</p></details> |

To fill this gap, we propose "Blink-Think-Link" (BTL), a brain-inspired framework for human-GUI interaction that mimics the human cognitive process between users and graphical interfaces. The system decomposes interactions into three biologically plausible phases: (1) Blink - rapid detection and attention to relevant screen areas, analogous to saccadic eye movements; (2) Think - higher-level reasoning and decision-making, mirroring cognitive planning; and (3) Link - generation of executable commands for precise motor control, emulating human action selection mechanisms. Additionally, we introduce two key technical innovations for the BTL framework: (1) Blink Data Generation - an automated annotation pipeline specifically optimized for blink data, and (2) BTL Reward -- the first rule-based reward mechanism that enables reinforcement learning driven by both process and outcome. Building upon this framework, we develop a GUI agent model named BTL-UI, which demonstrates consistent state-of-the-art performance across both static GUI understanding and dynamic interaction tasks in comprehensive benchmarks. These results provide conclusive empirical validation of the framework's efficacy in developing advanced GUI Agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

However, such agents often suffer from inefficiencies in multi-turn interactions, frequently trapped in repetitive loops or issuing ineffective commands, leading to redundant computational overhead. Instead of relying solely on learning from trajectories, we take a first step toward exploring the early-exit behavior for LLM-based agents. We propose two complementary approaches: 1. an $\textbf{intrinsic}$ method that injects exit instructions during generation, and 2. an $\textbf{extrinsic}$ method that verifies task completion to determine when to halt an agent's trial. To evaluate early-exit mechanisms, we introduce two metrics: one measures the reduction of $\textbf{redundant steps}$ as a positive effect, and the other evaluates $\textbf{progress degradation}$ as a negative effect. Experiments with 4 different LLMs across 5 embodied environments show significant efficiency improvements, with only minor drops in agent performance. We also validate a practical strategy where a stronger agent assists after an early-exit agent, achieving better performance with the same total steps. We will release our code to support further research.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2025 - Findings</p></details> |

Across three studies, we evaluate its feasibility and limitations. In Study 1, we show that large language models (LLMs) capture semantic similarities among Big Five measures, providing a basis for personality assignment. In Study 2, we create AI-Agents using prompts designed based on the Big Five Inventory-2 (BFI-2) in different format, and find that AI-Agents powered by new models align more closely with human responses on the Mini-Markers test, although the finer pattern of results (e.g., factor loading patterns) were sometimes inconsistent. In Study 3, we validate our AI-Agents on risk-taking and moral dilemma vignettes, finding that models prompted with the BFI-2-Expanded format most closely reproduce human personality-decision associations, while safety-aligned models generally inflate 'moral' ratings. Overall, our results show that AI-Agents align with humans in correlations between input Big Five traits and output responses and may serve as useful tools for preliminary research. Nevertheless, discrepancies in finer response patterns indicate that AI-Agents cannot (yet) fully substitute for human participants in precision or high-stakes projects.</p></details> |  |

A Security Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20383v3)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Web AI agents have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in addressing complex web navigation tasks. However, emerging research shows that these agents exhibit greater vulnerability compared to standalone Large Language Models (LLMs), despite both being built upon the same safety-aligned models. This discrepancy is particularly concerning given the greater flexibility of Web AI Agent compared to standalone LLMs, which may expose them to a wider range of adversarial user inputs. To build a scaffold that addresses these concerns, this study investigates the underlying factors that contribute to the increased vulnerability of Web AI agents. Notably, this disparity stems from the multifaceted differences between Web AI agents and standalone LLMs, as well as the complex signals - nuances that simple evaluation metrics, such as success rate, often fail to capture. To tackle these challenges, we propose a component-level analysis and a more granular, systematic evaluation framework. Through this fine-grained investigation, we identify three critical factors that amplify the vulnerability of Web AI agents; (1) embedding user goals into the system prompt, (2) multi-step action generation, and (3) observational capabilities. Our findings highlights the pressing need to enhance security and robustness in AI agent design and provide actionable insights for targeted defense strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: http://vulnerable-ai-agents.github.io</p></details> |

This greatly expands their abilities as various agents. However, LLMs rely entirely on the text descriptions of tools to decide which ones to use--a process that is surprisingly fragile. In this work, we expose a vulnerability in prevalent tool/function-calling protocols by investigating a series of edits to tool descriptions, some of which can drastically increase a tool's usage from LLMs when competing with alternatives. Through controlled experiments, we show that tools with properly edited descriptions receive over 10 times more usage from GPT-4.1 and Qwen2.5-7B than tools with original descriptions. We further evaluate how various edits to tool descriptions perform when competing directly with one another and how these trends generalize or differ across a broader set of 17 different models. These phenomena, while giving developers a powerful way to promote their tools, underscore the need for a more reliable foundation for agentic LLMs to select and utilize tools and resources.

Prior research suggests that security flaws at the model level do not fully capture the risks present in agentic deployments, where models interact with tools and external environments. This paper investigates this gap by conducting a comparative red teaming analysis of GPT-OSS-20B, a 20-billion parameter open-source model. Using our observability framework AgentSeer to deconstruct agentic systems into granular actions and components, we apply iterative red teaming attacks with harmful objectives from HarmBench at two distinct levels: the standalone model and the model operating within an agentic loop. Our evaluation reveals fundamental differences between model level and agentic level vulnerability profiles. Critically, we discover the existence of agentic-only vulnerabilities, attack vectors that emerge exclusively within agentic execution contexts while remaining inert against standalone models. Agentic level iterative attacks successfully compromise objectives that completely failed at the model level, with tool-calling contexts showing 24\% higher vulnerability than non-tool contexts. Conversely, certain model-specific exploits work exclusively at the model level and fail when transferred to agentic contexts, demonstrating that standalone model vulnerabilities do not always generalize to deployed systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Winne...</summary><p>Winner of the OpenAI GPT-OSS-20B Red Teaming Challenge (Kaggle, 2025)</p></details> |

Implemented at the Advanced Light Source particle accelerator, the system translates natural language user prompts into structured execution plans that combine archive data retrieval, control-system channel resolution, automated script generation, controlled machine interaction, and analysis. In a representative machine physics task, we show that preparation time was reduced by two orders of magnitude relative to manual scripting even for a system expert, while operator-standard safety constraints were strictly upheld. Core architectural features, plan-first orchestration, bounded tool access, and dynamic capability selection, enable transparent, auditable execution with fully reproducible artifacts. These results establish a blueprint for the safe integration of agentic AI into accelerator experiments and demanding machine physics studies, as well as routine operations, with direct portability across accelerators worldwide and, more broadly, to other large-scale scientific infrastructures.</p></details> |  |

MADP leverages diffusion models to generate samples from complex and high-dimensional action distributions that capture the interdependencies between agents' actions. Each robot conditions policy sampling on a fused representation of its own observations and perceptual embeddings received from peers. To evaluate this approach, we task a team of holonomic robots piloted by MADP to address coverage control-a canonical multi agent navigation problem. The policy is trained via imitation learning from a clairvoyant expert on the coverage control problem, with the diffusion process parameterized by a spatial transformer architecture to enable decentralized inference. We evaluate the system under varying numbers, locations, and variances of importance density functions, capturing the robustness demands of real-world coverage tasks. Experiments demonstrate that our model inherits valuable properties from diffusion models, generalizing across agent densities and environments, and consistently outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |

We present an LLM-based SLR evaluation copilot built on a Multi-Agent System (MAS) architecture to assist researchers in assessing the overall quality of the systematic literature reviews. The system automates protocol validation, methodological assessment, and topic relevance checks using a scholarly database. Unlike conventional single-agent methods, our design integrates a specialized agentic approach aligned with PRISMA guidelines to support more structured and interpretable evaluations. We conducted an initial study on five published SLRs from diverse domains, comparing system outputs to expert-annotated PRISMA scores, and observed 84% agreement. While early results are promising, this work represents a first step toward scalable and accurate NLP-driven systems for interdisciplinary workflows and reveals their capacity for rigorous, domain-agnostic knowledge aggregation to streamline the review process.</p></details> |  |

Conducting an SLR is, however, largely a manual process. In recent years, researchers have made significant progress in automating portions of the SLR pipeline to reduce the effort and time required for high-quality reviews; nevertheless, there remains a lack of AI-agent-based systems that automate the entire SLR workflow. To this end, we introduce a novel multi-AI-agent system designed to fully automate SLRs. Leveraging large language models (LLMs), our system streamlines the review process to enhance efficiency and accuracy. Through a user-friendly interface, researchers specify a topic; the system then generates a search string to retrieve relevant academic papers. Next, an inclusion/exclusion filtering step is applied to titles relevant to the research area. The system subsequently summarizes paper abstracts and retains only those directly related to the field of study. In the final phase, it conducts a thorough analysis of the selected papers with respect to predefined research questions. This paper presents the system, describes its operational framework, and demonstrates how it substantially reduces the time and effort traditionally required for SLRs while maintaining comprehensiveness and precision.

In contrast, Large Language Models (LLMs) offer strong reasoning capabilities, broad general-purpose knowledge, in-context learning, and cross-modal transfer abilities, positioning them as powerful tools for automating and generalizing SP workflows. Motivated by these potentials, we introduce SignalLLM, the first general-purpose LLM-based agent framework for general SP tasks. Unlike prior LLM-based SP approaches that are limited to narrow applications or tricky prompting, SignalLLM introduces a principled, modular architecture. It decomposes high-level SP goals into structured subtasks via in-context learning and domain-specific retrieval, followed by hierarchical planning through adaptive retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and refinement; these subtasks are then executed through prompt-based reasoning, cross-modal reasoning, code synthesis, model invocation, or data-driven LLM-assisted modeling. Its generalizable design enables the flexible selection of problem solving strategies across different signal modalities, task types, and data conditions. We demonstrate the versatility and effectiveness of SignalLLM through five representative tasks in communication and sensing, such as radar target detection, human activity recognition, and text compression. Experimental results show superior performance over traditional and existing LLM-based methods, particularly in few-shot and zero-shot settings.</p></details> | 11 pages |
| **[MAST: Multi-Agent Spatial Transformer for Learning to Collaborate](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17195v1)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This article presents a novel multi-agent spatial transformer (MAST) for learning communication policies in large-scale decentralized and collaborative multi-robot systems (DC-MRS). Challenges in collaboration in DC-MRS arise from: (i) partial observable states as robots make only localized perception, (ii) limited communication range with no central server, and (iii) independent execution of actions. The robots need to optimize a common task-specific objective, which, under the restricted setting, must be done using a communication policy that exhibits the desired collaborative behavior. The proposed MAST is a decentralized transformer architecture that learns communication policies to compute abstract information to be shared with other agents and processes the received information with the robot's own observations. The MAST extends the standard transformer with new positional encoding strategies and attention operations that employ windowing to limit the receptive field for MRS. These are designed for local computation, shift-equivariance, and permutation equivariance, making it a promising approach for DC-MRS. We demonstrate the efficacy of MAST on decentralized assignment and navigation (DAN) and decentralized coverage control. Efficiently trained using imitation learning in a centralized setting, the decentralized MAST policy is robust to communication delays, scales to large teams, and performs better than the baselines and other learning-based approaches.</p></details> |  |

However, manual thematic analysis is time-consuming and limits scalability. Recent advances in LLMs offer a pathway to automate thematic analysis, but alignment with human results remains limited. To address these limitations, we propose SFT-TA, an automated thematic analysis framework that embeds supervised fine-tuned (SFT) agents within a multi-agent system. Our framework outperforms existing frameworks and the gpt-4o baseline in alignment with human reference themes. We observed that SFT agents alone may underperform, but achieve better results than the baseline when embedded within a multi-agent system. Our results highlight that embedding SFT agents in specific roles within a multi-agent system is a promising pathway to improve alignment with desired outputs for thematic analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[ARE: Scaling Up Agent Environments and Evaluations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17158v1)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Meta Agents Research Environments (ARE), a research platform for scalable creation of environments, integration of synthetic or real applications, and execution of agentic orchestrations. ARE provides simple abstractions to build complex and diverse environments, each with their own rules, tools, content, and verifiers, helping to bridge the gap between model development and real-world deployment. We also propose Gaia2, a benchmark built in ARE and designed to measure general agent capabilities. Beyond search and execution, Gaia2 requires agents to handle ambiguities and noise, adapt to dynamic environments, collaborate with other agents, and operate under temporal constraints. Unlike prior benchmarks, Gaia2 runs asynchronously, surfacing new failure modes that are invisible in static settings. Our experiments show that no system dominates across the intelligence spectrum: stronger reasoning often comes at the cost of efficiency, and budget scaling curves plateau, highlighting the need for new architectures and adaptive compute strategies. Perhaps more importantly, ARE abstractions enable continuous extension of Gaia2 to other environments, empowering the community to rapidly create new benchmarks tailored to their domains. In AI's second half, progress increasingly depends on defining meaningful tasks and robust evaluations to drive frontier capabilities forward.</p></details> |  |
| **[Style-Preserving Policy Optimization for Game Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16995v3)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Proficient game agents with diverse play styles enrich the gaming experience and enhance the replay value of games. However, recent advancements in game AI based on reinforcement learning have predominantly focused on improving proficiency, whereas methods based on evolution algorithms generate agents with diverse play styles but exhibit subpar performance compared to RL methods. To address this gap, this paper proposes Mixed Proximal Policy Optimization (MPPO), a method designed to improve the proficiency of existing suboptimal agents while retaining their distinct styles. MPPO unifies loss objectives for both online and offline samples and introduces an implicit constraint to approximate demonstrator policies by adjusting the empirical distribution of samples. Empirical results across environments of varying scales demonstrate that MPPO achieves proficiency levels comparable to, or even superior to, pure online algorithms while preserving demonstrators' play styles. This work presents an effective approach for generating highly proficient and diverse game agents, ultimately contributing to more engaging gameplay experiences.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Autocomplete: Designing CopilotLens Towards Transparent and Explainable AI Coding Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20062v3)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI-powered code assistants are widely used to generate code completions, significantly boosting developer productivity. However, these tools typically present suggestions without explaining their rationale, leaving their decision-making process inscrutable. This opacity hinders developers' ability to critically evaluate outputs, form accurate mental models, and calibrate trust in the system. To address this, we introduce CopilotLens, a novel interactive framework that reframes code completion from a simple suggestion into a transparent, explainable interaction. CopilotLens operates as an explanation layer that reconstructs the AI agent's "thought process" through a dynamic, two-level interface. The tool aims to surface both high-level code changes and the specific codebase context influences. This paper presents the design and rationale of CopilotLens, offering a concrete framework and articulating expectations on deepening comprehension and calibrated trust, which we plan to evaluate in subsequent work.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted at The First Workshop on the Application of LLM Explainability to Reasoning and Planning (XLLM-Reason-Plan) @ COLM 2025</p></details> |

Existing methods typically depend on vector retrieval and hierarchical storage, yet they are prone to noise accumulation, uncontrolled memory expansion, and limited generalization across domains. To address these challenges, we present SEDM, Self-Evolving Distributed Memory, a verifiable and adaptive framework that transforms memory from a passive repository into an active, self-optimizing component. SEDM integrates verifiable write admission based on reproducible replay, a self-scheduling memory controller that dynamically ranks and consolidates entries according to empirical utility, and cross-domain knowledge diffusion that abstracts reusable insights to support transfer across heterogeneous tasks. Evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SEDM improves reasoning accuracy while reducing token overhead compared with strong memory baselines, and further enables knowledge distilled from fact verification to enhance multi-hop reasoning. The results highlight SEDM as a scalable and sustainable memory mechanism for open-ended multi-agent collaboration. The code will be released in the later stage of this project.</p></details> |  |

However, a critical bottleneck lies in the manual engineering of reward functions and training curricula for complex and dynamic driving tasks, which is a labor-intensive and time-consuming process. To address this problem, we propose OGR (Orchestrate, Generate, Reflect), a novel automated driving policy learning framework that leverages vision-language model (VLM)-based multi-agent collaboration. Our framework capitalizes on advanced reasoning and multimodal understanding capabilities of VLMs to construct a hierarchical agent system. Specifically, a centralized orchestrator plans high-level training objectives, while a generation module employs a two-step analyze-then-generate process for efficient generation of reward-curriculum pairs. A reflection module then facilitates iterative optimization based on the online evaluation. Furthermore, a dedicated memory module endows the VLM agents with the capabilities of long-term memory. To enhance robustness and diversity of the generation process, we introduce a parallel generation scheme and a human-in-the-loop technique for augmentation of the reward observation space. Through efficient multi-agent cooperation and leveraging rich multimodal information, OGR enables the online evolution of reinforcement learning policies to acquire interaction-aware driving skills. Extensive experiments in the CARLA simulator demonstrate the superior performance, robust generalizability across distinct urban scenarios, and strong compatibility with various RL algorithms. Further real-world experiments highlight the practical viability and effectiveness of our framework. The source code will be available upon acceptance of the paper.</p></details> |  |

We argue that successfully deploying AI software engineers requires a level of trust equal to or even greater than the trust established by human-driven software engineering practices. The recent trend toward LLM agents offers a path toward integrating the power of LLMs to create new code with the power of analysis tools to increase trust in the code. This opinion piece comments on whether LLM agents could dominate software engineering workflows in the future and whether the focus of programming will shift from programming at scale to programming with trust.</p></details> | 5 pages |
| **[AudioGenie-Reasoner: A Training-Free Multi-Agent Framework for Coarse-to-Fine Audio Deep Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16971v1)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Audio deep reasoning is a challenging task that requires expert-level perception, multi-step logical inference, and the integration of contextual knowledge. However, existing models suffer from a gap between audio perception and reasoning abilities due to the lack of training data with explicit reasoning chains and the absence of mechanisms for active exploration and iterative refinement. To address these challenges, we propose AudioGenie-Reasoner (AGR), the first unified training-free multi-agent system that coordinates perception and reasoning over an evolving chain of textual evidence. Our key idea is a paradigm shift that transforms audio deep reasoning into complex text understanding task from a new perspective, thereby unlocking the full potential of large language models. Specifically, the design of AGR mimics the human coarse-to-fine cognitive process. It first transforms the input audio into a coarse text-based document. Then, we design a novel proactive iterative document refinement loop, featuring tool-augmented routes and specialized agents, to continuously search for missing information and augment the evidence chain in a coarse-to-fine manner until sufficient question-related information is gathered for making final predictions. Experimental results show that AGR achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance over existing open-source audio deep reasoning models across various benchmarks. The code will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal Logic-Based Multi-Vehicle Backdoor Attacks against Offline RL Agents in End-to-end Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16950v1)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Assessing the safety of autonomous driving (AD) systems against security threats, particularly backdoor attacks, is a stepping stone for real-world deployment. However, existing works mainly focus on pixel-level triggers that are impractical to deploy in the real world. We address this gap by introducing a novel backdoor attack against the end-to-end AD systems that leverage one or more other vehicles' trajectories as triggers. To generate precise trigger trajectories, we first use temporal logic (TL) specifications to define the behaviors of attacker vehicles. Configurable behavior models are then used to generate these trajectories, which are quantitatively evaluated and iteratively refined based on the TL specifications. We further develop a negative training strategy by incorporating patch trajectories that are similar to triggers but are designated not to activate the backdoor. It enhances the stealthiness of the attack and refines the system's responses to trigger scenarios. Through extensive experiments on 5 offline reinforcement learning (RL) driving agents with 6 trigger patterns and target action combinations, we demonstrate the flexibility and effectiveness of our proposed attack, showing the under-exploration of existing end-to-end AD systems' vulnerabilities to such trajectory-based backdoor attacks.</p></details> |  |

Yet, a pressing challenge remains: How can we trust these agents especially in zero-shot settings with no fine-tuning? We introduce a novel modular Agentic AI visual classification framework that integrates generalist multimodal agents with a non-visual reasoning orchestrator and a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) module. Applied to apple leaf disease diagnosis, we benchmark three configurations: (I) zero-shot with confidence-based orchestration, (II) fine-tuned agents with improved performance, and (III) trust-calibrated orchestration enhanced by CLIP-based image retrieval and re-evaluation loops. Using confidence calibration metrics (ECE, OCR, CCC), the orchestrator modulates trust across agents. Our results demonstrate a 77.94\% accuracy improvement in the zero-shot setting using trust-aware orchestration and RAG, achieving 85.63\% overall. GPT-4o showed better calibration, while Qwen-2.5-VL displayed overconfidence. Furthermore, image-RAG grounded predictions with visually similar cases, enabling correction of agent overconfidence via iterative re-evaluation. The proposed system separates perception (vision agents) from meta-reasoning (orchestrator), enabling scalable and interpretable multi-agent AI. This blueprint illustrates how Agentic AI can deliver trustworthy, modular, and transparent reasoning, and is extensible to diagnostics, biology, and other trust-critical domains. In doing so, we highlight Agentic AI not just as an architecture but as a paradigm for building reliable multi-agent intelligence. agentic ai, orchestrator agent trust, trust orchestration, visual classification, retrieval augmented reasoning</p></details> |  |

SWE-BENCH PRO contains 1,865 problems sourced from a diverse set of 41 actively maintained repositories spanning business applications, B2B services, and developer tools. The benchmark is partitioned into a public set with open access to problems sourced from 11 repositories, a held-out set of 12 repositories and a commercial set of 18 proprietary repositories where we have formal partnership agreements with early-stage startups. Problems in the held-out and the commercial set are not publicly accessible, but we release results on the commercial set. Our benchmark features long-horizon tasks that may require hours to days for a professional software engineer to complete, often involving patches across multiple files and substantial code modifications. All tasks are human-verified and augmented with sufficient context to ensure resolvability. In our evaluation of widely used coding models, under a unified scaffold, we observe that their performance on SWE-Bench PRO remains below 25% (Pass@1), with GPT-5 achieving the highest score to date at 23.3%. To better understand these limitations, we cluster the failure modes observed in the collected agent trajectories for a clearer characterization of the error patterns exhibited by current models. Overall, SWE-BENCH PRO provides a contamination-resistant testbed that more faithfully captures the complexity and diversity of real-world software development, advancing the pursuit of truly autonomous software engineering agents at a professional level.</p></details> |  |

However, these systems risk reinforcing filter bubbles and political polarization by failing to incorporate diverse perspectives. Stance detection -- identifying a text's position on a target -- can help mitigate this by enabling viewpoint-aware recommendations and data-driven analyses of media bias. Yet, existing stance detection research remains largely limited to short texts and high-resource languages. To address these gaps, we introduce \textsc{K-News-Stance}, the first Korean dataset for article-level stance detection, comprising 2,000 news articles with article-level and 21,650 segment-level stance annotations across 47 societal issues. We also propose \textsc{JoA-ICL}, a \textbf{Jo}urnalism-guided \textbf{A}gentic \textbf{I}n-\textbf{C}ontext \textbf{L}earning framework that employs a language model agent to predict the stances of key structural segments (e.g., leads, quotations), which are then aggregated to infer the overall article stance. Experiments showed that \textsc{JoA-ICL} outperforms existing stance detection methods, highlighting the benefits of segment-level agency in capturing the overall position of long-form news articles. Two case studies further demonstrate its broader utility in promoting viewpoint diversity in news recommendations and uncovering patterns of media bias.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2025 (24 pages)</p></details> |

OBI is positively correlated with returns, and some investors try to use it to improve performance. Large orders placed at once can reveal intent, invite front-running, raise volatility, and cause losses. Execution algorithms therefore split parent orders into smaller lots to limit price distortion. In principle, using OBI inside such algorithms could improve execution, but prior evidence is scarce because isolating OBI's effect in real markets is nearly impossible amid many external factors. Multi-agent simulation offers a way to study this. In an artificial market, individual actors are agents whose rules and interactions form the model. This study builds an execution algorithm that accounts for OBI, tests it across several market patterns in artificial markets, and analyzes mechanisms, comparing it with a conventional (OBI-agnostic) algorithm. Results: (i) In stable markets, the OBI strategy's performance depends on the number of order slices; outcomes vary with how the parent order is partitioned. (ii) In markets with unstable prices, the OBI-based algorithm outperforms the conventional approach. (iii) Under spoofing manipulation, the OBI strategy is not significantly worse than the conventional algorithm, indicating limited vulnerability to spoofing. Overall, OBI provides a useful signal for execution. Incorporating OBI can add value - especially in volatile conditions - while remaining reasonably robust to spoofing; in calm markets, benefits are sensitive to slicing design.</p></details> |  |
| **[BlockA2A: Towards Secure and Verifiable Agent-to-Agent Interoperability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01332v3)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid adoption of agentic AI, powered by large language models (LLMs), is transforming enterprise ecosystems with autonomous agents that execute complex workflows. Yet we observe several key security vulnerabilities in LLM-driven multi-agent systems (MASes): fragmented identity frameworks, insecure communication channels, and inadequate defenses against Byzantine agents or adversarial prompts. In this paper, we present the first systematic analysis of these emerging multi-agent risks and explain why the legacy security strategies cannot effectively address these risks. Afterwards, we propose BlockA2A, the first unified multi-agent trust framework that enables secure and verifiable and agent-to-agent interoperability. At a high level, BlockA2A adopts decentralized identifiers (DIDs) to enable fine-grained cross-domain agent authentication, blockchain-anchored ledgers to enable immutable auditability, and smart contracts to dynamically enforce context-aware access control policies. BlockA2A eliminates centralized trust bottlenecks, ensures message authenticity and execution integrity, and guarantees accountability across agent interactions. Furthermore, we propose a Defense Orchestration Engine (DOE) that actively neutralizes attacks through real-time mechanisms, including Byzantine agent flagging, reactive execution halting, and instant permission revocation. Empirical evaluations demonstrate BlockA2A's effectiveness in neutralizing prompt-based, communication-based, behavioral and systemic MAS attacks. We formalize its integration into existing MAS and showcase a practical implementation for Google's A2A protocol. Experiments confirm that BlockA2A and DOE operate with sub-second overhead, enabling scalable deployment in production LLM-based MAS environments.</p></details> | 43 pages |
| **[Dynamic Speculative Agent Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01920v3)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite their remarkable success in complex tasks propelling widespread adoption, large language-model-based agents still face critical deployment challenges due to prohibitive latency and inference costs. While recent work has explored various methods to accelerate inference, existing approaches suffer from significant limitations: they either fail to preserve performance fidelity, require extensive offline training of router modules, or incur excessive operational costs. Moreover, they provide minimal user control over the tradeoff between acceleration and other performance metrics. To address these gaps, we introduce Dynamic Speculative Planning (DSP), an asynchronous online reinforcement learning framework that provides lossless acceleration with substantially reduced costs without requiring additional pre-deployment preparation. DSP explicitly optimizes a joint objective balancing end-to-end latency against dollar cost, allowing practitioners to adjust a single parameter that steers the system toward faster responses, cheaper operation, or any point along this continuum. Experiments on two standard agent benchmarks demonstrate that DSP achieves comparable efficiency to the fastest lossless acceleration method while reducing total cost by 30% and unnecessary cost up to 60%. Our code and data are available through https://github.com/guanyilin428/Dynamic-Speculative-Planning.</p></details> | 19 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Building Coding Agents via Entropy-Enhanced Multi-Turn Preference Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12434v2)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software engineering presents complex, multi-step challenges for Large Language Models (LLMs), requiring reasoning over large codebases and coordinated tool use. The difficulty of these tasks is exemplified by benchmarks like SWE-bench, where current LLMs still struggle to resolve real-world issues. A promising approach to enhance performance is test-time scaling (TTS), but its gains are heavily dependent on the diversity of model outputs. While standard alignment methods such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO) are effective at aligning model outputs with human preferences, this process can come at the cost of reduced diversity, limiting the effectiveness of TTS. Additionally, existing preference optimization algorithms are typically designed for single-turn tasks and do not fully address the complexities of multi-turn reasoning and tool integration required for interactive coding agents. To bridge this gap, we introduce EntroPO, an entropy-enhanced framework that adapts existing preference optimization algorithms to the multi-turn, tool-assisted setting. EntroPO augments the preference objective to explicitly preserve policy entropy and generalizes learning to optimize over multi-turn interactions rather than single-turn responses. We validate EntroPO by fine-tuning a diverse suite of models from different families and sizes (up to 106B parameters). To maximize performance gains from TTS, we further propose a hybrid best-trajectory selection scheme combining a learned verifier model with model free approaches. On the \swebench leaderboard, our approach establishes new state-of-the-art results among open-weight models. A 30B parameter model trained with EntroPO ranks 1st on \lite and 4th on \verified on the open-weight leaderboard, surpassed only by models with over 10x more parameters(\eg$>$350B).</p></details> |  |
| **[Controlled Yet Natural: A Hybrid BDI-LLM Conversational Agent for Child Helpline Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16784v1)** | 2025-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Child helpline training often relies on human-led roleplay, which is both time- and resource-consuming. To address this, rule-based interactive agent simulations have been proposed to provide a structured training experience for new counsellors. However, these agents might suffer from limited language understanding and response variety. To overcome these limitations, we present a hybrid interactive agent that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) into a rule-based Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) framework, simulating more realistic virtual child chat conversations. This hybrid solution incorporates LLMs into three components: intent recognition, response generation, and a bypass mechanism. We evaluated the system through two studies: a script-based assessment comparing LLM-generated responses to human-crafted responses, and a within-subject experiment (N=37) comparing the LLM-integrated agent with a rule-based version. The first study provided evidence that the three LLM components were non-inferior to human-crafted responses. In the second study, we found credible support for two hypotheses: participants perceived the LLM-integrated agent as more believable and reported more positive attitudes toward it than the rule-based agent. Additionally, although weaker, there was some support for increased engagement (posterior probability = 0.845, 95% HDI [-0.149, 0.465]). Our findings demonstrate the potential of integrating LLMs into rule-based systems, offering a promising direction for more flexible but controlled training systems.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we explore a future scenario where both consumers and merchants authorize AI agents to fully automate negotiations and transactions. We aim to answer two key questions: (1) Do different LLM agents vary in their ability to secure favorable deals for users? (2) What risks arise from fully automating deal-making with AI agents in consumer markets? To address these questions, we develop an experimental framework that evaluates the performance of various LLM agents in real-world negotiation and transaction settings. Our findings reveal that AI-mediated deal-making is an inherently imbalanced game -- different agents achieve significantly different outcomes for their users. Moreover, behavioral anomalies in LLMs can result in financial losses for both consumers and merchants, such as overspending or accepting unreasonable deals. These results underscore that while automation can improve efficiency, it also introduces substantial risks. Users should exercise caution when delegating business decisions to AI agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[Time to Talk: LLM Agents for Asynchronous Group Communication in Mafia Games](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05309v2)** | 2025-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs are used predominantly in synchronous communication, where a human user and a model communicate in alternating turns. In contrast, many real-world settings are asynchronous. For example, in group chats, online team meetings, or social games, there is no inherent notion of turns. In this work, we develop an adaptive asynchronous LLM agent consisting of two modules: a generator that decides what to say, and a scheduler that decides when to say it. To evaluate our agent, we collect a unique dataset of online Mafia games, where our agent plays with human participants. Overall, our agent performs on par with human players, both in game performance metrics and in its ability to blend in with the other human players. Our analysis shows that the agent's behavior in deciding when to speak closely mirrors human patterns, although differences emerge in message content. We make all of our code and data publicly available. This work paves the way for integration of LLMs into realistic human group settings, from assistance in team discussions to educational and professional environments where complex social dynamics must be navigated.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Transparent and Incentive-Compatible Collaboration in Decentralized LLM Multi-Agent Systems: A Blockchain-Driven Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16736v1)** | 2025-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled the emergence of autonomous agents capable of complex reasoning, planning, and interaction. However, coordinating such agents at scale remains a fundamental challenge, particularly in decentralized environments where communication lacks transparency and agent behavior cannot be shaped through centralized incentives. We propose a blockchain-based framework that enables transparent agent registration, verifiable task allocation, and dynamic reputation tracking through smart contracts. The core of our design lies in two mechanisms: a matching score-based task allocation protocol that evaluates agents by reputation, capability match, and workload; and a behavior-shaping incentive mechanism that adjusts agent behavior via feedback on performance and reward. Our implementation integrates GPT-4 agents with Solidity contracts and demonstrates, through 50-round simulations, strong task success rates, stable utility distribution, and emergent agent specialization. The results underscore the potential for trustworthy, incentive-compatible multi-agent coordination in open environments.</p></details> | 17 pages, 7 figures |
| **[HypeMARL: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning For High-Dimensional, Parametric, and Distributed Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16709v1)** | 2025-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep reinforcement learning has recently emerged as a promising feedback control strategy for complex dynamical systems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). When dealing with distributed, high-dimensional problems in state and control variables, multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has been proposed as a scalable approach for breaking the curse of dimensionality. In particular, through decentralized training and execution, multiple agents cooperate to steer the system towards a target configuration, relying solely on local state and reward information. However, the principle of locality may become a limiting factor whenever a collective, nonlocal behavior of the agents is crucial to maximize the reward function, as typically happens in PDE-constrained optimal control problems. In this work, we propose HypeMARL: a decentralized MARL algorithm tailored to the control of high-dimensional, parametric, and distributed systems. HypeMARL employs hypernetworks to effectively parametrize the agents' policies and value functions with respect to the system parameters and the agents' relative positions, encoded by sinusoidal positional encoding. Through the application on challenging control problems, such as density and flow control, we show that HypeMARL (i) can effectively control systems through a collective behavior of the agents, outperforming state-of-the-art decentralized MARL, (ii) can efficiently deal with parametric dependencies, (iii) requires minimal hyperparameter tuning and (iv) can reduce the amount of expensive environment interactions by a factor of ~10 thanks to its model-based extension, MB-HypeMARL, which relies on computationally efficient deep learning-based surrogate models approximating the dynamics locally, with minimal deterioration of the policy performance.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce WebResearcher, a novel framework for building such agents through two key components: (1) WebResearcher, an iterative deep-research paradigm that reformulates deep research as a Markov Decision Process, where agents periodically consolidate findings into evolving reports while maintaining focused workspaces, overcoming the context suffocation and noise contamination that plague existing mono-contextual approaches; and (2) WebFrontier, a scalable data synthesis engine that generates high-quality training data through tool-augmented complexity escalation, enabling systematic creation of research tasks that bridge the gap between passive knowledge recall and active knowledge construction. Notably, we find that the training data from our paradigm significantly enhances tool-use capabilities even for traditional mono-contextual methods. Furthermore, our paradigm naturally scales through parallel thinking, enabling concurrent multi-agent exploration for more comprehensive conclusions.

This challenge arises in typical scenarios such as replacing obsolete hardware and adapting configurations to emerging paradigms like Software Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV). Engineers need to thoroughly understand both source and target configuration models, which requires considerable effort due to the complexity and evolving nature of these specifications. To promote automation in network configuration translation, we propose INTA, an intent-based translation framework that leverages Large Language Model (LLM) agents. The key idea of INTA is to use configuration intent as an intermediate representation for translation. It first employs LLMs to decompose configuration files and extract fine-grained intents for each configuration fragment. These intents are then used to retrieve relevant manuals of the target device. Guided by a syntax checker, INTA incrementally generates target configurations. The translated configurations are further verified and refined for semantic consistency. We implement INTA and evaluate it on real-world configuration datasets from the industry. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in translation accuracy and exhibits strong generalizability. INTA achieves an accuracy of 98.15% in terms of both syntactic and view correctness, and a command recall rate of 84.72% for the target configuration. The semantic consistency report of the translated configuration further demonstrates its practical value in real-world network operations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by The 33rd IEEE International Conference on Network Protocols (IEEE ICNP 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Governed By Agents: A Survey On The Role Of Agentic AI In Future Computing Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16676v1)** | 2025-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of agentic Artificial Intelligence (AI), which can operate autonomously, demonstrate goal-directed behavior, and adaptively learn, indicates the onset of a massive change in today's computing infrastructure. This study investigates how agentic AI models' multiple characteristics may impact the architecture, governance, and operation under which computing environments function. Agentic AI has the potential to reduce reliance on extremely large (public) cloud environments due to resource efficiency, especially with processing and/or storage. The aforementioned characteristics provide us with an opportunity to canvas the likelihood of strategic migration in computing infrastructures away from massive public cloud services, towards more locally distributed architectures: edge computing and on-premises computing infrastructures. Many of these likely migrations will be spurred by factors like on-premises processing needs, diminished data consumption footprints, and cost savings. This study examines how a solution for implementing AI's autonomy could result in a re-architecture of the systems and model a departure from today's governance models to help us manage these increasingly autonomous agents, and an operational overhaul of processes over a very diverse computing systems landscape that bring together computing via cloud, edge, and on-premises computing solutions. To enable us to explore these intertwined decisions, it will be fundamentally important to understand how to best position agentic AI, and to navigate the future state of computing infrastructures.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Risk Ontology for Evaluating AI-Powered Psychotherapy Virtual Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15108v2)** | 2025-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Intelligent Virtual Agents acting as psychotherapists presents significant opportunities for expanding mental healthcare access. However, their deployment has also been linked to serious adverse outcomes, including user harm and suicide, facilitated by a lack of standardized evaluation methodologies capable of capturing the nuanced risks of therapeutic interaction. Current evaluation techniques lack the sensitivity to detect subtle changes in patient cognition and behavior during therapy sessions that may lead to subsequent decompensation. We introduce a novel risk ontology specifically designed for the systematic evaluation of conversational AI psychotherapists. Developed through an iterative process including review of the psychotherapy risk literature, qualitative interviews with clinical and legal experts, and alignment with established clinical criteria (e.g., DSM-5) and existing assessment tools (e.g., NEQ, UE-ATR), the ontology aims to provide a structured approach to identifying and assessing user/patient harms. We provide a high-level overview of this ontology, detailing its grounding, and discuss potential use cases. We discuss four use cases in detail: monitoring real user interactions, evaluation with simulated patients, benchmarking and comparative analysis, and identifying unexpected outcomes. The proposed ontology offers a foundational step towards establishing safer and more responsible innovation in the domain of AI-driven mental health support.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is a preprint version of the paper accepted to IVA'25</p></details> |
| **[Robust Native Language Identification through Agentic Decomposition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16666v1)** | 2025-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) often achieve high performance in native language identification (NLI) benchmarks by leveraging superficial contextual clues such as names, locations, and cultural stereotypes, rather than the underlying linguistic patterns indicative of native language (L1) influence. To improve robustness, previous work has instructed LLMs to disregard such clues. In this work, we demonstrate that such a strategy is unreliable and model predictions can be easily altered by misleading hints. To address this problem, we introduce an agentic NLI pipeline inspired by forensic linguistics, where specialized agents accumulate and categorize diverse linguistic evidence before an independent final overall assessment. In this final assessment, a goal-aware coordinating agent synthesizes all evidence to make the NLI prediction. On two benchmark datasets, our approach significantly enhances NLI robustness against misleading contextual clues and performance consistency compared to standard prompting methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP* 2025</p></details> |
| **[ADVEDM:Fine-grained Adversarial Attack against VLM-based Embodied Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16645v1)** | 2025-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs), with their strong reasoning and planning capabilities, are widely used in embodied decision-making (EDM) tasks in embodied agents, such as autonomous driving and robotic manipulation. Recent research has increasingly explored adversarial attacks on VLMs to reveal their vulnerabilities. However, these attacks either rely on overly strong assumptions, requiring full knowledge of the victim VLM, which is impractical for attacking VLM-based agents, or exhibit limited effectiveness. The latter stems from disrupting most semantic information in the image, which leads to a misalignment between the perception and the task context defined by system prompts. This inconsistency interrupts the VLM's reasoning process, resulting in invalid outputs that fail to affect interactions in the physical world. To this end, we propose a fine-grained adversarial attack framework, ADVEDM, which modifies the VLM's perception of only a few key objects while preserving the semantics of the remaining regions. This attack effectively reduces conflicts with the task context, making VLMs output valid but incorrect decisions and affecting the actions of agents, thus posing a more substantial safety threat in the physical world. We design two variants of based on this framework, ADVEDM-R and ADVEDM-A, which respectively remove the semantics of a specific object from the image and add the semantics of a new object into the image. The experimental results in both general scenarios and EDM tasks demonstrate fine-grained control and excellent attack performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bayesian Ego-graph inference for Networked Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16606v1)** | 2025-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In networked multi-agent reinforcement learning (Networked-MARL), decentralized agents must act under local observability and constrained communication over fixed physical graphs. Existing methods often assume static neighborhoods, limiting adaptability to dynamic or heterogeneous environments. While centralized frameworks can learn dynamic graphs, their reliance on global state access and centralized infrastructure is impractical in real-world decentralized systems. We propose a stochastic graph-based policy for Networked-MARL, where each agent conditions its decision on a sampled subgraph over its local physical neighborhood. Building on this formulation, we introduce BayesG, a decentralized actor-framework that learns sparse, context-aware interaction structures via Bayesian variational inference. Each agent operates over an ego-graph and samples a latent communication mask to guide message passing and policy computation. The variational distribution is trained end-to-end alongside the policy using an evidence lower bound (ELBO) objective, enabling agents to jointly learn both interaction topology and decision-making strategies. BayesG outperforms strong MARL baselines on large-scale traffic control tasks with up to 167 agents, demonstrating superior scalability, efficiency, and performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[OnlineMate: An LLM-Based Multi-Agent Companion System for Cognitive Support in Online Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14803v2)** | 2025-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In online learning environments, students often lack personalized peer interactions, which play a crucial role in supporting cognitive development and learning engagement. Although previous studies have utilized large language models (LLMs) to simulate interactive dynamic learning environments for students, these interactions remain limited to conversational exchanges, lacking insights and adaptations to the learners' individualized learning and cognitive states. As a result, students' interest in discussions with AI learning companions is low, and they struggle to gain inspiration from such interactions. To address this challenge, we propose OnlineMate, a multi-agent learning companion system driven by LLMs that integrates the Theory of Mind (ToM). OnlineMate is capable of simulating peer-like agent roles, adapting to learners' cognitive states during collaborative discussions, and inferring their psychological states, such as misunderstandings, confusion, or motivation. By incorporating Theory of Mind capabilities, the system can dynamically adjust its interaction strategies to support the development of higher-order thinking and cognition. Experimental results in simulated learning scenarios demonstrate that OnlineMate effectively fosters deep learning and discussions while enhancing cognitive engagement in online educational settings.</p></details> | work in progress |
| **[Can an Individual Manipulate the Collective Decisions of Multi-Agents?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16494v1)** | 2025-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Individual Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant capabilities across various domains, such as healthcare and law. Recent studies also show that coordinated multi-agent systems exhibit enhanced decision-making and reasoning abilities through collaboration. However, due to the vulnerabilities of individual LLMs and the difficulty of accessing all agents in a multi-agent system, a key question arises: If attackers only know one agent, could they still generate adversarial samples capable of misleading the collective decision? To explore this question, we formulate it as a game with incomplete information, where attackers know only one target agent and lack knowledge of the other agents in the system. With this formulation, we propose M-Spoiler, a framework that simulates agent interactions within a multi-agent system to generate adversarial samples. These samples are then used to manipulate the target agent in the target system, misleading the system's collaborative decision-making process. More specifically, M-Spoiler introduces a stubborn agent that actively aids in optimizing adversarial samples by simulating potential stubborn responses from agents in the target system. This enhances the effectiveness of the generated adversarial samples in misleading the system. Through extensive experiments across various tasks, our findings confirm the risks posed by the knowledge of an individual agent in multi-agent systems and demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. We also explore several defense mechanisms, showing that our proposed attack framework remains more potent than baselines, underscoring the need for further research into defensive strategies.</p></details> |  |

Traditional formation control techniques often rely on time-parameterized trajectories and path integrals, which can result in synchronization issues and rigid behavior. In this work, we address the problem of sequential path following, where agents maintain fixed spatial separation along a common trajectory, guided by a leader under centralized control. We introduce Robot Conga, a leader-follower control strategy that updates each agent's desired state based on the leader's spatial displacement rather than time, assuming access to a global position reference, an assumption valid in indoor environments equipped with motion capture, vision-based tracking, or UWB localization systems. The algorithm was validated in simulation using both TurtleBot3 and quadruped (Laikago) robots. Results demonstrate accurate trajectory tracking, stable inter-agent spacing, and fast convergence, with all agents aligning within 250 time steps (approx. 0.25 seconds) in the quadruped case, and almost instantaneously in the TurtleBot3 implementation.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 Pag...</summary><p>6 Pages, 8 Figures.

We present DECOY, a novel multi-agent simulator that abstracts strategic, long-horizon planning in 3D terrains into high-level discretized simulation while preserving low-level environmental fidelity. Using Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) as a testbed, our framework accurately simulates gameplay using only movement decisions as tactical positioning -- without explicitly modeling low-level mechanics such as aiming and shooting. Central to our approach is a waypoint system that simplifies and discretizes continuous states and actions, paired with neural predictive and generative models trained on real CS:GO tournament data to reconstruct event outcomes. Extensive evaluations show that replays generated from human data in DECOY closely match those observed in the original game. Our publicly available simulation environment provides a valuable tool for advancing research in strategic multi-agent planning and behavior generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the Winter Simulation Conference 2025, December, Seattle USA</p></details> |

However, recent studies indicate that generative agent behaviors often deviate from expert expectations and real-world data--a phenomenon we term the Behavior-Realism Gap. To address this, we introduce a theoretical framework called Persona-Environment Behavioral Alignment (PEBA), formulated as a distribution matching problem grounded in Lewin's behavior equation stating that behavior is a function of the person and their environment. Leveraging PEBA, we propose PersonaEvolve (PEvo), an LLM-based optimization algorithm that iteratively refines agent personas, implicitly aligning their collective behaviors with realistic expert benchmarks within a specified environmental context. We validate PEvo in an active shooter incident simulation we developed, achieving an 84% average reduction in distributional divergence compared to no steering and a 34% improvement over explicit instruction baselines. Results also show PEvo-refined personas generalize to novel, related simulation scenarios. Our method greatly enhances behavioral realism and reliability in high-stakes social simulations. More broadly, the PEBA-PEvo framework provides a principled approach to developing trustworthy LLM-driven social simulations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the 2025 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP 2025), Main Conference</p></details> |

However, current systems are still facing challenges of inter-agent communication, coordination, and interaction with heterogeneous tools and resources. Most recently, the Model Context Protocol (MCP) by Anthropic and Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication protocol by Google have been introduced, and to the best of our knowledge, very few applications exist where both protocols are employed within a single MAS framework. We present a pilot study of AgentMaster, a novel modular multi-protocol MAS framework with self-implemented A2A and MCP, enabling dynamic coordination, flexible communication, and rapid development with faster iteration. Through a unified conversational interface, the system supports natural language interaction without prior technical expertise and responds to multimodal queries for tasks including information retrieval, question answering, and image analysis. The experiments are validated through both human evaluation and quantitative metrics, including BERTScore F1 (96.3%) and LLM-as-a-Judge G-Eval (87.1%). These results demonstrate robust automated inter-agent coordination, query decomposition, task allocation, dynamic routing, and domain-specific relevant responses. Overall, our proposed framework contributes to the potential capabilities of domain-specific, cooperative, and scalable conversational AI powered by MAS.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP 2025</p></details> |

Yet developing AI-XR systems remains challenging due to fragmented toolchains that push developers into ad hoc integrations, diverting their attention away from essential design concerns such as interactivity and context awareness. To address this issue, we present XARP (XR Agent-ready Remote Procedures), a toolkit for AI-XR development designed for both human developers and AI agents. XARP implements JSON-based remote procedure calls that allow server-side Python to control XR clients, providing a high-level abstraction over low-level integration details. Humans can use XARP as a Python library to write XR applications with reduced implementation overhead. AI agents operate with the same abstraction to dynamically call tools to generate XR applications at runtime in response to context changes and user requests. XARP offers Model Context Protocol (MCP) connectivity that allows third-party agents and tools to leverage XR capabilities, previously unavailable. We conducted three case studies that demonstrate XARP supports a variety of AI-XR applications, including AI-guided fencing, drone assistance, and room layout design. We evaluated XARP in a walkthrough study with 24 AI and XR developers. UTAUT scores indicate high potential for adoption, and participants reported that XARP can reduce authoring time, lower entry barriers for developers unfamiliar with AI or XR, and enable the implementation of novel AI-XR systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[ASTRA: A Negotiation Agent with Adaptive and Strategic Reasoning via Tool-integrated Action for Dynamic Offer Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07129v2)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Negotiation requires dynamically balancing self-interest and cooperation within the flow of conversation to maximize one's own utility. Yet, existing agents struggle due to bounded rationality in human data, low adaptability to counterpart behavior, and limited strategic reasoning. To address this, we introduce principle-driven negotiation agents, powered by ASTRA, a novel framework for turn-level offer optimization grounded in two core principles: opponent modeling and Tit-for-Tat reciprocity. ASTRA operates in three stages: (1) interpreting counterpart behavior, (2) optimizing counteroffers via a tool-integrated action with a linear programming (LP) solver, and (3) selecting offers based on strategy assessment and the partner's acceptance probability. Through simulations and human evaluations, our agent effectively adapts to an opponent's shifting stance and achieves favorable outcomes through enhanced adaptability and strategic reasoning. Beyond enhancing negotiation performance, it also serves as a powerful coaching tool, offering interpretable strategic feedback and optimal offer recommendations beyond human bounded rationality, with its potential further validated through human evaluation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2025 (Main Conference)</p></details> |

Traditional retrieval systems rely on a single database and retriever, but financial applications require more sophisticated approaches to handle intricate regulatory filings, market analyses, and extensive multi-year reports. We introduce a framework for financial Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) that leverages agentic AI and the Multi-HyDE system, an approach that generates multiple, nonequivalent queries to boost the effectiveness and coverage of retrieval from large, structured financial corpora. Our pipeline is optimized for token efficiency and multi-step financial reasoning, and we demonstrate that their combination improves accuracy by 11.2% and reduces hallucinations by 15%. Our method is evaluated on standard financial QA benchmarks, showing that integrating domain-specific retrieval mechanisms such as Multi-HyDE with robust toolsets, including keyword and table-based retrieval, significantly enhances both the accuracy and reliability of answers. This research not only delivers a modular, adaptable retrieval framework for finance but also highlights the importance of structured agent workflows and multi-perspective retrieval for trustworthy deployment of AI in high-stakes financial applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 Pa...</summary><p>14 Pages, 8 Tables, 2 Figures.

| **[Generalizability of Large Language Model-Based Agents: A Comprehensive Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16330v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have emerged as a new paradigm that extends LLMs' capabilities beyond text generation to dynamic interaction with external environments. By integrating reasoning with perception, memory, and tool use, agents are increasingly deployed in diverse domains like web navigation and household robotics. A critical challenge, however, lies in ensuring agent generalizability - the ability to maintain consistent performance across varied instructions, tasks, environments, and domains, especially those beyond agents' fine-tuning data. Despite growing interest, the concept of generalizability in LLM-based agents remains underdefined, and systematic approaches to measure and improve it are lacking. In this survey, we provide the first comprehensive review of generalizability in LLM-based agents. We begin by emphasizing agent generalizability's importance by appealing to stakeholders and clarifying the boundaries of agent generalizability by situating it within a hierarchical domain-task ontology. We then review datasets, evaluation dimensions, and metrics, highlighting their limitations. Next, we categorize methods for improving generalizability into three groups: methods for the backbone LLM, for agent components, and for their interactions. Moreover, we introduce the distinction between generalizable frameworks and generalizable agents and outline how generalizable frameworks can be translated into agent-level generalizability. Finally, we identify critical challenges and future directions, including developing standardized frameworks, variance- and cost-based metrics, and approaches that integrate methodological innovations with architecture-level designs. By synthesizing progress and highlighting opportunities, this survey aims to establish a foundation for principled research on building LLM-based agents that generalize reliably across diverse applications.</p></details> |  |

While modern conversational LLM agents directly assist human users with tasks through a chat interface, we study this alternative paradigm for interacting with LLM agents, which we call "overhearing agents." Rather than demanding the user's attention, overhearing agents continuously monitor ambient activity and intervene only when they can provide contextual assistance. In this paper, we present the first analysis of overhearing LLM agents as a distinct paradigm in human-AI interaction and establish a taxonomy of overhearing agent interactions and tasks grounded in a survey of works on prior LLM-powered agents and exploratory HCI studies. Based on this taxonomy, we create a list of best practices for researchers and developers building overhearing agent systems. Finally, we outline the remaining research gaps and reveal opportunities for future research in the overhearing paradigm.</p></details> | 8 pages, 1 figure |

In response, we present AgentA/B, a novel system that leverages Large Language Model-based autonomous agents (LLM Agents) to automatically simulate user interaction behaviors with real webpages. AgentA/B enables scalable deployment of LLM agents with diverse personas, each capable of navigating the dynamic webpage and interactively executing multi-step interactions like search, clicking, filtering, and purchasing. In a demonstrative controlled experiment, we employ AgentA/B to simulate a between-subject A/B testing with 1,000 LLM agents Amazon.com, and compare agent behaviors with real human shopping behaviors at a scale.

The main limitation of previous drone cinematography workflows is that they require manual selection of waypoints and view angles based on predefined human intent, which is labor-intensive and yields inconsistent performance. In this paper, we propose employing large language models (LLMs) and vision foundation models (VFMs) to convert free-form natural language prompts directly into executable indoor UAV video tours. Specifically, our method comprises a vision-language retrieval pipeline for initial waypoint selection, a preference-based Bayesian optimization framework that refines poses using aesthetic feedback, and a motion planner that generates safe quadrotor trajectories. We validate ACDC through both simulation and hardware-in-the-loop experiments, demonstrating that it robustly produces professional-quality footage across diverse indoor scenes without requiring expertise in robotics or cinematography. These results highlight the potential of embodied AI agents to close the loop from open-vocabulary dialogue to real-world autonomous aerial cinematography.</p></details> |  |

A critical component of these systems is the Tool Invocation Prompt (TIP), which defines tool interaction protocols and guides LLMs to ensure the security and correctness of tool usage. Despite its importance, TIP security has been largely overlooked. This work investigates TIP-related security risks, revealing that major LLM-based systems like Cursor, Claude Code, and others are vulnerable to attacks such as remote code execution (RCE) and denial of service (DoS). Through a systematic TIP exploitation workflow (TEW), we demonstrate external tool behavior hijacking via manipulated tool invocations. We also propose defense mechanisms to enhance TIP security in LLM-based agentic systems.</p></details> |  |

The traditional RL approach represents networks as a list of computers in various states of safety or threat. Unfortunately, these models are forced to overfit to specific network topologies, rendering them ineffective when faced with even small environmental perturbations. In this work, we frame ACD as a two-player context-based partially observable Markov decision problem with observations represented as attributed graphs. This approach allows our agents to reason through the lens of relational inductive bias. Agents learn how to reason about hosts interacting with other system entities in a more general manner, and their actions are understood as edits to the graph representing the environment. By introducing this bias, we will show that our agents can better reason about the states of networks and zero-shot adapt to new ones. We show that this approach outperforms the state-of-the-art by a wide margin, and makes our agents capable of defending never-before-seen networks against a wide range of adversaries in a variety of complex, and multi-agent environments.</p></details> |  |

Existing unified frameworks often fail to capture these structured distributional shifts, resulting in suboptimal generalization across roles and domains. We propose AdaSports-Traj, an adaptive trajectory modeling framework that explicitly addresses both intra-domain and inter-domain distribution discrepancies in sports. At its core, AdaSports-Traj incorporates a Role- and Domain-Aware Adapter to conditionally adjust latent representations based on agent identity and domain context. Additionally, we introduce a Hierarchical Contrastive Learning objective, which separately supervises role-sensitive and domain-aware representations to encourage disentangled latent structures without introducing optimization conflict.

However, their high autonomy and opaque reasoning processes pose significant challenges for traditional software observability methods. To address this, we introduce the concept of cognitive observability - the ability to recover and inspect the implicit reasoning behind agent decisions. We present Watson, a general-purpose framework for observing the reasoning processes of fast-thinking LLM agents without altering their behavior. Watson retroactively infers reasoning traces using prompt attribution techniques. We evaluate Watson in both manual debugging and automated correction scenarios across the MMLU benchmark and the AutoCodeRover and OpenHands agents on the SWE-bench-lite dataset. In both static and dynamic settings, Watson surfaces actionable reasoning insights and supports targeted interventions, demonstrating its practical utility for improving transparency and reliability in Agentware systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning with Low-Level MPC for Multi-Agent Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15799v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Achieving safe and coordinated behavior in dynamic, constraint-rich environments remains a major challenge for learning-based control. Pure end-to-end learning often suffers from poor sample efficiency and limited reliability, while model-based methods depend on predefined references and struggle to generalize. We propose a hierarchical framework that combines tactical decision-making via reinforcement learning (RL) with low-level execution through Model Predictive Control (MPC). For the case of multi-agent systems this means that high-level policies select abstract targets from structured regions of interest (ROIs), while MPC ensures dynamically feasible and safe motion. Tested on a predator-prey benchmark, our approach outperforms end-to-end and shielding-based RL baselines in terms of reward, safety, and consistency, underscoring the benefits of combining structured learning with model-based control.</p></details> |  |

Manual curation is slow, while existing automated methods are either not adaptive to dynamic regional markets (top-down) or struggle to build coherent hierarchies from noisy data (bottom-up). We introduce CLIMB (CLusterIng-based Multi-agent taxonomy Builder), a framework that fully automates the creation of high-quality, data-driven taxonomies from raw job postings. CLIMB uses global semantic clustering to distill core occupations, then employs a reflection-based multi-agent system to iteratively build a coherent hierarchy. On three diverse, real-world datasets, we show that CLIMB produces taxonomies that are more coherent and scalable than existing methods and successfully capture unique regional characteristics. We release our code and datasets at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/CLIMB.</p></details> |  |
| **[GUI-ReWalk: Massive Data Generation for GUI Agent via Stochastic Exploration and Intent-Aware Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15738v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graphical User Interface (GUI) Agents, powered by large language and vision-language models, hold promise for enabling end-to-end automation in digital environments. However, their progress is fundamentally constrained by the scarcity of scalable, high-quality trajectory data. Existing data collection strategies either rely on costly and inconsistent manual annotations or on synthetic generation methods that trade off between diversity and meaningful task coverage. To bridge this gap, we present GUI-ReWalk: a reasoning-enhanced, multi-stage framework for synthesizing realistic and diverse GUI trajectories. GUI-ReWalk begins with a stochastic exploration phase that emulates human trial-and-error behaviors, and progressively transitions into a reasoning-guided phase where inferred goals drive coherent and purposeful interactions. Moreover, it supports multi-stride task generation, enabling the construction of long-horizon workflows across multiple applications. By combining randomness for diversity with goal-aware reasoning for structure, GUI-ReWalk produces data that better reflects the intent-aware, adaptive nature of human-computer interaction. We further train Qwen2.5-VL-7B on the GUI-ReWalk dataset and evaluate it across multiple benchmarks, including Screenspot-Pro, OSWorld-G, UI-Vision, AndroidControl, and GUI-Odyssey. Results demonstrate that GUI-ReWalk enables superior coverage of diverse interaction flows, higher trajectory entropy, and more realistic user intent. These findings establish GUI-ReWalk as a scalable and data-efficient framework for advancing GUI agent research and enabling robust real-world automation.</p></details> |  |
| **[SMART: Scalable Multi-Agent Reasoning and Trajectory Planning in Dense Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15737v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-vehicle trajectory planning is a non-convex problem that becomes increasingly difficult in dense environments due to the rapid growth of collision constraints. Efficient exploration of feasible behaviors and resolution of tight interactions are essential for real-time, large-scale coordination. This paper introduces SMART, Scalable Multi-Agent Reasoning and Trajectory Planning, a hierarchical framework that combines priority-based search with distributed optimization to achieve efficient and feasible multi-vehicle planning. The upper layer explores diverse interaction modes using reinforcement learning-based priority estimation and large-step hybrid A* search, while the lower layer refines solutions via parallelizable convex optimization. By partitioning space among neighboring vehicles and constructing robust feasible corridors, the method decouples the joint non-convex problem into convex subproblems solved efficiently in parallel. This design alleviates the step-size trade-off while ensuring kinematic feasibility and collision avoidance. Experiments show that SMART consistently outperforms baselines. On 50 m x 50 m maps, it sustains over 90% success within 1 s up to 25 vehicles, while baselines often drop below 50%. On 100 m x 100 m maps, SMART achieves above 95% success up to 50 vehicles and remains feasible up to 90 vehicles, with runtimes more than an order of magnitude faster than optimization-only approaches. Built on vehicle-to-everything communication, SMART incorporates vehicle-infrastructure cooperation through roadside sensing and agent coordination, improving scalability and safety. Real-world experiments further validate this design, achieving planning times as low as 0.014 s while preserving cooperative behaviors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Vulnerable Agent Identification in Large-Scale Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15103v2)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Partial agent failure becomes inevitable when systems scale up, making it crucial to identify the subset of agents whose compromise would most severely degrade overall performance. In this paper, we study this Vulnerable Agent Identification (VAI) problem in large-scale multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). We frame VAI as a Hierarchical Adversarial Decentralized Mean Field Control (HAD-MFC), where the upper level involves an NP-hard combinatorial task of selecting the most vulnerable agents, and the lower level learns worst-case adversarial policies for these agents using mean-field MARL. The two problems are coupled together, making HAD-MFC difficult to solve. To solve this, we first decouple the hierarchical process by Fenchel-Rockafellar transform, resulting a regularized mean-field Bellman operator for upper level that enables independent learning at each level, thus reducing computational complexity. We then reformulate the upper-level combinatorial problem as a MDP with dense rewards from our regularized mean-field Bellman operator, enabling us to sequentially identify the most vulnerable agents by greedy and RL algorithms. This decomposition provably preserves the optimal solution of the original HAD-MFC. Experiments show our method effectively identifies more vulnerable agents in large-scale MARL and the rule-based system, fooling system into worse failures, and learns a value function that reveals the vulnerability of each agent.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to NIPS 2025</p></details> |

The technical innovations are embodied in three key aspects: First, we combine the pre-trained Drain log parsing algorithm with multi-level data filtering mechanism to efficiently compress massive logs into high-quality fault features. Second, we employ a dual anomaly detection approach that integrates Isolation Forest unsupervised learning algorithms with status code validation to achieve comprehensive trace anomaly identification. Third, we design a statistical symmetry ratio filtering mechanism coupled with a two-stage LLM analysis strategy to enable full-stack phenomenon summarization across node-service-pod hierarchies. The multimodal root cause analysis module leverages carefully designed cross-modal prompts to deeply integrate multimodal anomaly information, fully exploiting the cross-modal understanding and logical reasoning capabilities of large language models to generate structured analysis results encompassing fault components, root cause descriptions, and reasoning trace. Comprehensive ablation studies validate the complementary value of each modal data and the effectiveness of the system architecture. The proposed solution demonstrates superior performance in complex microservice fault scenarios, achieving a final score of 50.71.

In this work, we introduce ScaleCUA, a step toward scaling open-source CUAs. It offers a large-scale dataset spanning 6 operating systems and 3 task domains, built via a closed-loop pipeline uniting automated agents with human experts. Trained on this scaled-up data, ScaleCUA can operate seamlessly across platforms. Specifically, it delivers strong gains over baselines (+26.6 on WebArena-Lite-v2, +10.7 on ScreenSpot-Pro) and sets new state-of-the-art results (94.4% on MMBench-GUI L1-Hard, 60.6% on OSWorld-G, 47.4% on WebArena-Lite-v2). These findings underscore the power of data-driven scaling for general-purpose computer use agents.

| **[Adaptive Self-improvement LLM Agentic System for ML Library Development](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02534v2)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>ML libraries, often written in architecture-specific programming languages (ASPLs) that target domain-specific architectures, are key to efficient ML systems. However, writing these high-performance ML libraries is challenging because it requires expert knowledge of ML algorithms and the ASPL. Large language models (LLMs), on the other hand, have shown general coding capabilities. However, challenges remain when using LLMs for generating ML libraries using ASPLs because 1) this task is complicated even for experienced human programmers and 2) there are limited code examples because of the esoteric and evolving nature of ASPLs. Therefore, LLMs need complex reasoning with limited data in order to complete this task. To address these challenges, we introduce an adaptive self-improvement agentic system. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of our system, we construct a benchmark of a typical ML library and generate ASPL code with both open and closed-source LLMs on this benchmark. Our results show improvements of up to $3.9\times$ over a baseline single LLM.</p></details> |  |

However, achieving human-level multi-perspective understanding and judgment remains a challenge. In this work, we propose Roundtable Essay Scoring (RES), a multi-agent evaluation framework designed to perform precise and human-aligned scoring under a zero-shot setting. RES constructs evaluator agents based on LLMs, each tailored to a specific prompt and topic context. Each agent independently generates a trait-based rubric and conducts a multi-perspective evaluation. Then, by simulating a roundtable-style discussion, RES consolidates individual evaluations through a dialectical reasoning process to produce a final holistic score that more closely aligns with human evaluation. By enabling collaboration and consensus among agents with diverse evaluation perspectives, RES outperforms prior zero-shot AES approaches. Experiments on the ASAP dataset using ChatGPT and Claude show that RES achieves up to a 34.86% improvement in average QWK over straightforward prompting (Vanilla) methods.</p></details> |  |

Traditional deep learning and reinforcement learning approaches typically demand large training datasets and encode diverse inputs into numerical representations, often at the cost of interpretability. Recent progress in large language model (LLM)-based agents has demonstrated the capacity to process multi-modal data and support complex investment decision-making. Building on these advances, we present \textbf{MountainLion}, a multi-modal, multi-agent system for financial trading that coordinates specialized LLM-based agents to interpret financial data and generate investment strategies. MountainLion processes textual news, candlestick charts, and trading signal charts to produce high-quality financial reports, while also enabling modification of reports and investment recommendations through data-driven user interaction and question answering. A central reflection module analyzes historical trading signals and outcomes to continuously refine decision processes, and the system is capable of real-time report analysis, summarization, and dynamic adjustment of investment strategies. Empirical results confirm that MountainLion systematically enriches technical price triggers with contextual macroeconomic and capital flow signals, providing a more interpretable, robust, and actionable investment framework that improves returns and strengthens investor confidence.</p></details> |  |

Utilizing the Anthropic Helpful-Harmless RLHF dataset, we train and evaluate four models: the base OPT350M, an SFT model, a DPO model, and a model trained with both SFT and DPO. We introduce three key evaluation metrics: Harmlessness Rate (HmR), Helpfulness Rate (HpR), and a Combined Alignment Score (CAS), all derived from reward model outputs. The results show that while SFT outperforms DPO, The combined SFT+DPO model outperforms all others across all metrics, demonstrating the complementary nature of these techniques. Our findings also highlight challenges posed by noisy data, limited GPU resources, and training constraints.

However, the evolution and mechanism behind the synergy of SFT and RL are still under-explored and inconclusive. In our study, we find the well-known claim "SFT memorizes, RL generalizes" is over-simplified, and discover that: (1) OOD performance peaks at the early stage of SFT and then declines (OOD forgetting), the best SFT checkpoint cannot be captured by training/test loss; (2) the subsequent RL stage does not generate fundamentally better OOD capability, instead it plays an \textbf{OOD restoration} role, recovering the lost reasoning ability during SFT; (3) The recovery ability has boundaries, \ie{} \textbf{if SFT trains for too short or too long, RL cannot recover the lost OOD ability;} (4) To uncover the underlying mechanisms behind the forgetting and restoration process, we employ SVD analysis on parameter matrices, manually edit them, and observe their impacts on model performance. Unlike the common belief that the shift of model capacity mainly results from the changes of singular values, we find that they are actually quite stable throughout fine-tuning. Instead, the OOD behavior strongly correlates with the \textbf{rotation of singular vectors}. Our findings re-identify the roles of SFT and RL in the two-stage fine-tuning and discover the rotation of singular vectors as the key mechanism. %reversing the rotations induced by SFT, which shows recovery from forgetting, whereas imposing the SFT parameter directions onto a RL-tuned model results in performance degradation.

| **[Beyond Two-Stage Training: Cooperative SFT and RL for LLM Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06948v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven effective in incentivizing the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), but suffers from severe efficiency challenges due to its trial-and-error nature. While the common practice employs supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a warm-up stage for RL, this decoupled two-stage approach limits interaction between SFT and RL, thereby constraining overall effectiveness. This study introduces a novel method for learning reasoning models that employs bilevel optimization to facilitate better cooperation between these training paradigms. By conditioning the SFT objective on the optimal RL policy, our approach enables SFT to meta-learn how to guide RL's optimization process. During training, the lower level performs RL updates while simultaneously receiving SFT supervision, and the upper level explicitly maximizes the cooperative gain-the performance advantage of joint SFT-RL training over RL alone. Empirical evaluations on five reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms baselines and achieves a better balance between effectiveness and efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Empowering Lightweight MLLMs with Reasoning via Long CoT SFT](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03321v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards has enhanced the reasoning of large-scale language models (LLMs), its efficacy for lightweight multimodal language models (MLLMs) with fewer than seven billion parameters remains underexplored. This paper investigates the role of long Chain-of-Thought (long CoT) data in enhancing the reasoning abilities of such MLLMs. Our findings demonstrate that Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with long CoT data significantly improves MLLM reasoning. Furthermore, we observe that after this initial SFT phase, MLLMs can achieve additional performance gains through a subsequent RL stage. We conclude that a SFT stage with long CoT data is a critical prerequisite for developing the reasoning capabilities of lightweight MLLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Blockwise SFT for Diffusion Language Models: Reconciling Bidirectional Attention and Autoregressive Decoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19529v1)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Discrete diffusion language models have shown strong potential for text generation, yet standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT) misaligns with their semi-autoregressive inference: training randomly masks tokens across the entire response, while inference generates fixed-size blocks sequentially. This mismatch introduces noisy prefixes and leaky suffixes, biasing gradients away from the desired blockwise likelihood. We propose Blockwise SFT, which partitions responses into fixed-size blocks, selects one active block per step for stochastic masking, freezes all preceding tokens, and fully hides future ones. Loss is computed only over the active block, directly mirroring the blockwise decoding process. Experiments on GSM8K, MATH, and MetaMathQA show consistent gains over classical SFT under equal compute or token budgets. Block size consistency studies and ablations confirm that improvements stem from faithful training-inference alignment rather than incidental masking effects. Our results highlight the importance of matching supervision granularity to the decoding procedure in diffusion-based language models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Breaking the SFT Plateau: Multimodal Structured Reinforcement Learning for Chart-to-Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13587v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While reinforcement learning (RL) has proven highly effective for general reasoning in vision-language models, its application to tasks requiring in-depth understanding of information-rich images and generation of structured outputs remains underexplored. Chart-to-code generation exemplifies this challenge, demanding complex reasoning over visual charts to generate structured code. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) alone is often insufficient, highlighting the need for effective RL strategies that appropriately reward structured outputs. We systematically investigate the performance plateau in SFT through large-scale experiments and propose Multimodal Structured Reinforcement Learning (MSRL) for chart-to-code generation, which substantially breaks through this plateau. We construct the largest training corpus to date, containing 3 million chart-code pairs from real-world arXiv tables to mitigate simplistic patterns of prior synthetic data. Despite reaching state-of-the-art performance, our experiments show that scaling SFT data eventually hits a plateau where further increases yield negligible improvements. Our MSRL method leverages a multi-granularity structured reward system using multimodal textual and visual feedback. At the textual level, rule-based rewards validate fine-grained code details. At the visual level, model-based rewards assess structural similarity by rendering generated code into images and employing an evaluator model. We implement this within a two-stage curriculum for training stability. Results demonstrate that MSRL significantly breaks the SFT plateau, improving high-level metrics by 6.2% and 9.9% on ChartMimic and ReachQA benchmarks respectively, achieving competitive performance with advanced closed-source models.</p></details> | technical report |
| **[On the Generalization of SFT: A Reinforcement Learning Perspective with Reward Rectification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05629v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a simple yet theoretically motivated improvement to Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) for the Large Language Model (LLM), addressing its limited generalization compared to reinforcement learning (RL). Through mathematical analysis, we reveal that standard SFT gradients implicitly encode a problematic reward structure that may severely restrict the generalization capabilities of model. To rectify this, we propose Dynamic Fine-Tuning (DFT), stabilizing gradient updates for each token by dynamically rescaling the objective function with the probability of this token. Remarkably, this single-line code change significantly outperforms standard SFT across multiple challenging benchmarks and base models, demonstrating greatly improved generalization. Additionally, our approach shows competitive results in offline RL settings, offering an effective yet simpler alternative. This work bridges theoretical insight and practical solutions, substantially advancing SFT performance.

| **[Scalpel vs. Hammer: GRPO Amplifies Existing Capabilities, SFT Replaces Them](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10616v2)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training large language models (LLMs) for reasoning via maths and code datasets has become a major new focus in LLM post-training. Two particularly popular approaches are reinforcement learning (RL) and supervised fine-tuning (SFT), but their training dynamics are poorly understood. We present a comparative analysis of RL and SFT on the same maths problems with the same model and similar hyperparameters. We find that RL yields minor in-domain gains on maths and slight degradation on knowledge-intensive benchmarks like MMLU, while both trends are more pronounced in SFT. We also analyse model parameters across checkpoints, observing that both algorithms modify query and key weights the most. Meanwhile, SFT exhibits greater updates and also affects mid-layer MLPs more, leading us to hypothesise that this may have caused the out-of-domain degradation. We therefore investigate whether freezing parts of the model during training can mitigate the reduced performance on knowledge-intensive benchmarks. However, our results are inconclusive, with benefits on GPQA:Diamond and degradation on other benchmarks. Taken together, our observations provide a preliminary indication for why RL amplifies existing capabilities, while SFT replaces old skills with new ones.</p></details> |  |
| **[OpenVLThinker: Complex Vision-Language Reasoning via Iterative SFT-RL Cycles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17352v2)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce OpenVLThinker, one of the first open-source large vision-language models (LVLMs) to exhibit sophisticated chain-of-thought reasoning, achieving notable performance gains on challenging visual reasoning tasks. While text-based reasoning models (e.g., Deepseek R1) show promising results in text-only tasks, distilling their reasoning into LVLMs via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) often results in performance degradation due to imprecise visual grounding. Conversely, purely reinforcement learning (RL)-based methods face a large search space, hindering the emergence of reflective behaviors in smaller models (e.g., 7B LVLMs). Surprisingly, alternating between SFT and RL ultimately results in significant performance improvements after a few iterations. Our analysis reveals that the base model rarely exhibits reasoning behaviors initially, but SFT effectively surfaces these latent actions and narrows the RL search space, accelerating the development of reasoning capabilities. Each subsequent RL stage further refines the model's reasoning skills, producing higher-quality SFT data for continued self-improvement. OpenVLThinker-7B consistently advances performance across six benchmarks demanding mathematical and general reasoning, notably improving MathVista by 3.8%, EMMA by 2.4%, and HallusionBench by 1.6%. Beyond demonstrating the synergy between SFT and RL for complex reasoning tasks, our findings provide early evidence towards achieving R1-style reasoning in multimodal contexts.

While Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) are the dominant training paradigms, a systematic methodology for combining them to maximize both accuracy and efficiency remains largely unexplored. This paper introduces a practical and effective training recipe that strategically integrates extended SFT with RL from online inference (GRPO). We posit that these methods play complementary, not competing, roles: a prolonged SFT phase first pushes the model's accuracy to its limits, after which a GRPO phase dramatically improves token efficiency while preserving this peak performance. Our experiments reveal that extending SFT for as many as 10 epochs is crucial for performance breakthroughs, and that the primary role of GRPO in this framework is to optimize solution length. The efficacy of our recipe is rigorously validated through top-tier performance on challenging benchmarks, including a high rank among over 2,200 teams in the strictly leak-free AI Mathematical Olympiad (AIMO). This work provides the community with a battle-tested blueprint for developing state-of-the-art mathematical reasoners that are both exceptionally accurate and practically efficient.

| **[The Synergy Dilemma of Long-CoT SFT and RL: Investigating Post-Training Techniques for Reasoning VLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07562v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large vision-language models (VLMs) increasingly adopt post-training techniques such as long chain-of-thought (CoT) supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) to elicit sophisticated reasoning. While these methods exhibit synergy in language-only models, their joint effectiveness in VLMs remains uncertain. We present a systematic investigation into the distinct roles and interplay of long-CoT SFT and RL across multiple multimodal reasoning benchmarks. We find that SFT improves performance on difficult questions by in-depth, structured reasoning, but introduces verbosity and degrades performance on simpler ones. In contrast, RL promotes generalization and brevity, yielding consistent improvements across all difficulty levels, though the improvements on the hardest questions are less prominent compared to SFT. Surprisingly, combining them through two-staged, interleaved, or progressive training strategies, as well as data mixing and model merging, all fails to produce additive benefits, instead leading to trade-offs in accuracy, reasoning style, and response length. This ``synergy dilemma'' highlights the need for more seamless and adaptive approaches to unlock the full potential of combined post-training techniques for reasoning VLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Implicit Reward as the Bridge: A Unified View of SFT and DPO Connections](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00018v2)** | 2025-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Post-training processes are essential phases in grounding pre-trained language models to real-world tasks, with learning from demonstrations or preference signals playing a crucial role in this adaptation. We present a unified theoretical framework bridging Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and preference learning in Large Language Model (LLM) post-training. Through rigorous mathematical derivation, we demonstrate that both SFT and preference learning methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) operate within the same optimal policy-reward subspace, with SFT representing a special case of implicit reward learning. Our analysis reveals a critical limitation in conventional SFT: the KL divergence term in distribution matching becomes constant with respect to the policy during optimization, failing to constrain model updates. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective learning rate reduction approach that yields significant performance improvements (up to \textbf{25\%} relative gain and \textbf{6\%} absolute win rate increase in instruction following tasks. Additionally, we derive alternative SFT objectives from various f-divergence functions that preserve the KL term during optimization, further enhancing post-DPO model performance. Finally, we extend the theoretical relationship between LLM logits and Q-functions from preference learning to the SFT context, providing mathematical derivations and experimental validation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bridging SFT and DPO for Diffusion Model Alignment with Self-Sampling Preference Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05255v2)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing post-training techniques are broadly categorized into supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) methods; the former is stable during training but suffers from limited generalization, while the latter, despite its stronger generalization capability, relies on additional preference data or reward models and carries the risk of reward exploitation. In order to preserve the advantages of both SFT and RL -- namely, eliminating the need for paired data and reward models while retaining the training stability of SFT and the generalization ability of RL -- a new alignment method, Self-Sampling Preference Optimization (SSPO), is proposed in this paper. SSPO introduces a Random Checkpoint Replay (RCR) strategy that utilizes historical checkpoints to construct paired data, thereby effectively mitigating overfitting. Simultaneously, a Self-Sampling Regularization (SSR) strategy is employed to dynamically evaluate the quality of generated samples; when the generated samples are more likely to be winning samples, the approach automatically switches from DPO (Direct Preference Optimization) to SFT, ensuring that the training process accurately reflects the quality of the samples. Experimental results demonstrate that SSPO not only outperforms existing methods on text-to-image benchmarks, but its effectiveness has also been validated in text-to-video tasks. We validate SSPO across both text-to-image and text-to-video benchmarks. SSPO surpasses all previous approaches on the text-to-image benchmarks and demonstrates outstanding performance on the text-to-video benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

However, existing approaches often fall short: methods solely employing reinforcement learning (RL) can struggle with sample inefficiency and activating entirely absent reasoning capabilities, while conventional pipelines that initiate with a cold-start supervised fine-tuning (SFT) phase before RL may restrict the model's exploratory capacity and face suboptimal convergence. In this work, we introduce \textbf{Metis-RISE} (\textbf{R}L \textbf{I}ncentivizes and \textbf{S}FT \textbf{E}nhances) for multimodal reasoning model learning. Unlike conventional approaches, Metis-RISE distinctively omits an initial SFT stage, beginning instead with an RL phase (e.g., using a Group Relative Policy Optimization variant) to incentivize and activate the model's latent reasoning capacity. Subsequently, the targeted SFT stage addresses two key challenges identified during RL: (1) \textit{inefficient trajectory sampling} for tasks where the model possesses but inconsistently applies correct reasoning, which we tackle using self-distilled reasoning trajectories from the RL model itself; and (2) \textit{fundamental capability absence}, which we address by injecting expert-augmented knowledge for prompts where the model entirely fails. This strategic application of RL for incentivization followed by SFT for enhancement forms the core of Metis-RISE, leading to two versions of our MLLMs (7B and 72B parameters). Evaluations on the OpenCompass Multimodal Reasoning Leaderboard demonstrate that both models achieve state-of-the-art performance among similar-sized models, with the 72B version ranking fourth overall.

The standard training approach combines a supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage, often to distill capabilities of a larger model, followed by a reinforcement learning (RL)stage such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). In this paper, we investigate the fundamental limitations of this SFT + RL paradigm and propose methods to overcome them. Under a suitable theoretical model, we demonstrate that the SFT + RL strategy can fail completely when (1) the expert's traces are too difficult for the small model to express, or (2) the small model's initialization has exponentially small likelihood of success. To address these, we introduce BREAD: a GRPO variant that unifies the SFT and RL stages via partial expert guidance and branched rollouts. When self-generated traces fail, BREAD adaptively inserts short expert prefixes/hints, allowing the small model to complete the rest of the reasoning path, and ensuring that each update includes at least one successful trace. This mechanism both densifies the reward signal and induces a natural learning curriculum. BREAD requires fewer than 40% of ground-truth traces, consistently outperforming standard GRPO while speeding up the training by about 3 times. Importantly, we demonstrate that BREAD helps the model solve problems that are otherwise unsolvable by the SFT + RL strategy, highlighting how branched rollouts and expert guidance can substantially boost SLM reasoning.</p></details> |  |

We begin by curating the SFT training data through two scaling strategies: increasing the number of collected prompts and the number of generated responses per prompt. Both approaches yield notable improvements in reasoning performance, with scaling the number of prompts resulting in more substantial gains. We then explore the following questions regarding the synergy between SFT and RL: (i) Does a stronger SFT model consistently lead to better final performance after large-scale RL training? (ii) How can we determine an appropriate sampling temperature during RL training to effectively balance exploration and exploitation for a given SFT initialization? Our findings suggest that (i) holds true, provided effective RL training is conducted, particularly when the sampling temperature is carefully chosen to maintain the temperature-adjusted entropy around 0.3, a setting that strikes a good balance between exploration and exploitation. Notably, the performance gap between initial SFT models narrows significantly throughout the RL process. Leveraging a strong SFT foundation and insights into the synergistic interplay between SFT and RL, our AceReason-Nemotron-1.1 7B model significantly outperforms AceReason-Nemotron-1.0 and achieves new state-of-the-art performance among Qwen2.5-7B-based reasoning models on challenging math and code benchmarks, thereby demonstrating the effectiveness of our post-training recipe.

| **[How Much Backtracking is Enough? Exploring the Interplay of SFT and RL in Enhancing LLM Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24273v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs) have effectively improved their reasoning abilities, particularly on mathematical and logical problems that have verifiable answers, through techniques such as supervised finetuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL). Prior research indicates that RL effectively internalizes search strategies, enabling long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, with backtracking emerging naturally as a learned capability. However, the precise benefits of backtracking, specifically, how significantly it contributes to reasoning improvements and the optimal extent of its use, remain poorly understood. In this work, we systematically investigate the dynamics between SFT and RL on eight reasoning tasks: Countdown, Sudoku, Arc 1D, Geometry, Color Cube Rotation, List Functions, Zebra Puzzles, and Self Reference. Our findings highlight that short CoT sequences used in SFT as a warm-up do have moderate contribution to RL training, compared with cold-start RL; however such contribution diminishes when tasks become increasingly difficult. Motivated by this observation, we construct synthetic datasets varying systematically in the number of backtracking steps and conduct controlled experiments to isolate the influence of either the correctness (content) or the structure (i.e., backtrack frequency). We find that (1) longer CoT with backtracks generally induce better and more stable RL training, (2) more challenging problems with larger search space tend to need higher numbers of backtracks during the SFT stage. Additionally, we demonstrate through experiments on distilled data that RL training is largely unaffected by the correctness of long CoT sequences, suggesting that RL prioritizes structural patterns over content correctness. Collectively, our results offer practical insights into designing optimal training strategies to effectively scale reasoning in LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[SFT Memorizes, RL Generalizes: A Comparative Study of Foundation Model Post-training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17161v2)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) are widely used post-training techniques for foundation models. However, their roles in enhancing model generalization capabilities remain unclear. This paper studies the difference between SFT and RL on generalization and memorization, focusing on text-based rule variants and visual variants. We introduce GeneralPoints, an arithmetic reasoning card game, and adopt V-IRL, a real-world navigation environment, to assess how models trained with SFT and RL generalize to unseen variants in both textual and visual domains. We show that RL, especially when trained with an outcome-based reward, generalizes across both rule-based textual and visual variants. SFT, in contrast, tends to memorize training data and struggles to generalize out-of-distribution scenarios. Further analysis reveals that RL improves the model's underlying visual recognition capabilities, contributing to its enhanced generalization in the visual domain. Despite RL's superior generalization, we show that SFT remains essential for effective RL training; SFT stabilizes the model's output format, enabling subsequent RL to achieve its performance gains. These findings demonstrates the capability of RL for acquiring generalizable knowledge in complex, multi-modal tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website at https://tianzhechu.com/SFTvsRL</p></details> |

In this work, we propose SOAEsV2-7B/72B, a specialized LLM series developed via a three-phase framework: 1) continual pre-training integrates domain knowledge while retaining base capabilities; 2) domain-progressive SFT employs curriculum-based learning strategy, transitioning from weakly relevant conversational data to expert-annotated SOAEs datasets to optimize domain-specific tasks; 3) distillation-enhanced speculative decoding accelerates inference via logit distillation between 72B target and 7B draft models, achieving 1.39-1.52$\times$ speedup without quality loss. Experimental results demonstrate that our domain-specific pre-training phase maintains 99.8% of original general language capabilities while significantly improving domain performance, resulting in a 1.08$\times$ improvement in Rouge-1 score and a 1.17$\times$ enhancement in BLEU-4 score. Ablation studies further show that domain-progressive SFT outperforms single-stage training, achieving 1.02$\times$ improvement in Rouge-1 and 1.06$\times$ in BLEU-4. Our work introduces a comprehensive, full-pipeline approach for optimizing SOAEs LLMs, bridging the gap between general language capabilities and domain-specific expertise.</p></details> |  |

With the rapid scaling of Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly through reinforcement learning (RL), there is a growing need for more capable discriminators. Consequently, advances in classification are becoming increasingly vital for enhancing the overall capabilities of LLMs. Traditional discriminative methods map text to labels but overlook LLMs' intrinsic generative strengths. Generative classification addresses this by prompting the model to directly output labels. However, existing studies still rely on simple SFT alone, seldom probing the interplay between training and inference prompts, and no work has systematically leveraged RL for generative text classifiers and unified SFT, RL, and inference-time prompting in one framework. We bridge this gap with GenCLS++, a framework that jointly optimizes SFT and RL while systematically exploring five high-level strategy dimensions-in-context learning variants, category definitions, explicit uncertainty labels, semantically irrelevant numeric labels, and perplexity-based decoding-during both training and inference. After an SFT "policy warm-up," we apply RL with a simple rule-based reward, yielding sizable extra gains. Across seven datasets, GenCLS++ achieves an average accuracy improvement of 3.46% relative to the naive SFT baseline; on public datasets, this improvement rises to 4.00%. Notably, unlike reasoning-intensive tasks that benefit from explicit thinking processes, we find that classification tasks perform better without such reasoning steps. These insights into the role of explicit reasoning provide valuable guidance for future LLM applications.</p></details> |  |

However, the specific capabilities enhanced through such fine-tuning remain poorly understood. In this paper, we conduct a detailed analysis of model performance on the AIME24 dataset to understand how reasoning capabilities evolve. We discover a ladder-like structure in problem difficulty, categorize questions into four tiers (Easy, Medium, Hard, and Extremely Hard (Exh)), and identify the specific requirements for advancing between tiers. We find that progression from Easy to Medium tier requires adopting an R1 reasoning style with minimal SFT (500-1K instances), while Hard-level questions suffer from frequent model's errors at each step of the reasoning chain, with accuracy plateauing at around 65% despite logarithmic scaling. Exh-level questions present a fundamentally different challenge; they require unconventional problem-solving skills that current models uniformly struggle with. Additional findings reveal that carefully curated small-scale datasets offer limited advantage-scaling dataset size proves far more effective. Our analysis provides a clearer roadmap for advancing language model capabilities in mathematical reasoning.</p></details> |  |

An Early Investigation into Training R1-Like Reasoning Large Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11468v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work revisits the dominant supervised fine-tuning (SFT) then reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm for training Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), and reveals a key finding: SFT can significantly undermine subsequent RL by inducing ``pseudo reasoning paths'' imitated from expert models. While these paths may resemble the native reasoning paths of RL models, they often involve prolonged, hesitant, less informative steps, and incorrect reasoning. To systematically study this effect, we introduce VLAA-Thinking, a new multimodal dataset designed to support reasoning in LVLMs. Constructed via a six-step pipeline involving captioning, reasoning distillation, answer rewrite and verification, VLAA-Thinking comprises high-quality, step-by-step visual reasoning traces for SFT, along with a more challenging RL split from the same data source. Using this dataset, we conduct extensive experiments comparing SFT, RL and their combinations. Results show that while SFT helps models learn reasoning formats, it often locks aligned models into imitative, rigid reasoning modes that impede further learning. In contrast, building on the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a novel mixed reward module integrating both perception and cognition signals, our RL approach fosters more genuine, adaptive reasoning behavior. Notably, our model VLAA-Thinker, based on Qwen2.5VL 3B, achieves top-1 performance on Open LMM Reasoning Leaderboard (https://huggingface.co/spaces/opencompass/Open_LMM_Reasoning_Leaderboard) among 4B scale LVLMs, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art by 1.8%. We hope our findings provide valuable insights in developing reasoning-capable LVLMs and can inform future research in this area.</p></details> |  |

However, to enhance its utility and reduce potential harm, SFT and alignment are applied sequentially to the pretrained model. Due to the differing nature and objective functions of SFT and alignment, catastrophic forgetting has become a significant issue. To address this, we introduce Unified Fine-Tuning (UFT), which integrates SFT and alignment into a single training stage using the same objective and loss functions through an implicit reward function. Our experimental results demonstrate that UFT outperforms SFT on instruction-tuning data alone. Moreover, when combining instruction-tuning data with alignment data, UFT effectively prevents catastrophic forgetting across these two stages and shows a clear advantage over sequentially applying SFT and alignment. This is evident in the significant improvements observed in the \textbf{ifeval} task for instruction-following and the \textbf{truthful-qa} task for factuality. The proposed general fine-tuning framework UFT establishes an effective and efficient pretraining-UFT paradigm for LLM training.</p></details> |  |

However, existing approaches struggle with temporal reasoning due to weak temporal correspondence in the data and reliance on the next-token prediction paradigm during training. To address these limitations, we propose TEMPLE (TEMporal Preference Learning), a systematic framework that enhances Video LLMs' temporal reasoning capabilities through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). To facilitate this, we introduce an automated preference data generation pipeline that systematically constructs preference pairs by selecting videos that are rich in temporal information, designing video-specific perturbation strategies, and finally evaluating model responses on clean and perturbed video inputs. Our temporal alignment features two key innovations: curriculum learning which that progressively increases perturbation difficulty to improve model robustness and adaptability; and "Pre-SFT Alignment'', applying preference optimization before instruction tuning to prioritize fine-grained temporal comprehension. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently improves Video LLM performance across multiple benchmarks with a relatively small set of self-generated DPO data. We further analyze the transferability of DPO data across architectures and the role of difficulty scheduling in optimization. Our findings highlight our TEMPLE as a scalable and efficient complement to SFT-based methods, paving the way for developing reliable Video LLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/lscpku/TEMPLE.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bring Remote Sensing Object Detect Into Nature Language Model: Using SFT Method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08144v2)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved significant success, demonstrating remarkable capabilities in understanding various images and videos, particularly in classification and detection tasks. However, due to the substantial differences between remote sensing images and conventional optical images, these models face considerable challenges in comprehension, especially in detection tasks. Directly prompting VLMs with detection instructions often leads to unsatisfactory results. To address this issue, this letter explores the application of VLMs for object detection in remote sensing images. Specifically, we constructed supervised fine-tuning (SFT) datasets using publicly available remote sensing object detection datasets, including SSDD, HRSID, and NWPU-VHR-10. In these new datasets, we converted annotation information into JSON-compliant natural language descriptions, facilitating more effective understanding and training for the VLM. We then evaluate the detection performance of various fine-tuning strategies for VLMs and derive optimized model weights for object detection in remote sensing images. Finally, we evaluate the model's prior knowledge capabilities using natural language queries. Experimental results demonstrate that, without modifying the model architecture, remote sensing object detection can be effectively achieved using natural language alone. Additionally, the model exhibits the ability to perform certain vision question answering (VQA) tasks. Our datasets and related code will be released soon.</p></details> |  |

However, attempts to extend this success to multimodal reasoning often failed to reproduce these key characteristics. In this report, we present the first successful replication of these emergent characteristics for multimodal reasoning on only a non-SFT 2B model. Starting with Qwen2-VL-2B and applying reinforcement learning directly on the SAT dataset, our model achieves 59.47% accuracy on CVBench, outperforming the base model by approximately ~30% and exceeding both SFT setting by ~2%. In addition, we share our failed attempts and insights in attempting to achieve R1-like reasoning using RL with instruct models. aiming to shed light on the challenges involved. Our key observations include: (1) applying RL on instruct model often results in trivial reasoning trajectories, and (2) naive length reward are ineffective in eliciting reasoning capabilities.

However, RLHF has been continuously challenged by its high complexity in implementation and computation consumption. Even with recent simplifications, such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Advantage Leftover Lunch (A-LoL), the problems of over-fitting and training instability remain hindering the alignment process from the expected optimal performance. To address the existing challenges, we propose a novel simplification of RLHF from the perspective of variational inference, called $\textbf{V}$ariational $\textbf{A}$lignment with $\textbf{R}$e-weighting ($\textbf{VAR}$). More specifically, by directly minimizing the distribution gap between the learning LLM policy and the optimal solution of RLHF, we transform the alignment objective into a reward-driven re-weighted supervised fine-tuning (SFT) form, which only requires minor adjustment on the SFT loss to obtain noticeable improvement on training stability and effectiveness. On comprehensive alignment and generation benchmarks, our VAR method has numerically achieved competitive performance in LLM alignment helpfulness and harmlessness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Provably Mitigating Overoptimization in RLHF: Your SFT Loss is Implicitly an Adversarial Regularizer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16436v3)** | 2024-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aligning generative models with human preference via RLHF typically suffers from overoptimization, where an imperfectly learned reward model can misguide the generative model to output undesired responses. We investigate this problem in a principled manner by identifying the source of the misalignment as a form of distributional shift and uncertainty in learning human preferences. To mitigate overoptimization, we first propose a theoretical algorithm that chooses the best policy for an adversarially chosen reward model; one that simultaneously minimizes the maximum likelihood estimation of the loss and a reward penalty term. Here, the reward penalty term is introduced to prevent the policy from choosing actions with spurious high proxy rewards, resulting in provable sample efficiency of the algorithm under a partial coverage style condition. Moving from theory to practice, the proposed algorithm further enjoys an equivalent but surprisingly easy-to-implement reformulation. Using the equivalence between reward models and the corresponding optimal policy, the algorithm features a simple objective that combines: (i) a preference optimization loss that directly aligns the policy with human preference, and (ii) a supervised learning loss that explicitly imitates the policy with a (suitable) baseline distribution. In the context of aligning large language models (LLM), this objective fuses the direct preference optimization (DPO) loss with the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) loss to help mitigate the overoptimization towards undesired responses, for which we name the algorithm Regularized Preference Optimization (RPO). Experiments of aligning LLMs demonstrate the improved performance of RPO compared with DPO baselines. Our work sheds light on the interplay between preference optimization and SFT in tuning LLMs with both theoretical guarantees and empirical evidence.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by The Thirty-Eighth Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems. 31 pages, 7 figures</p></details> |
| **[Continual SFT Matches Multimodal RLHF with Negative Supervision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14797v1)** | 2024-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal RLHF usually happens after supervised finetuning (SFT) stage to continually improve vision-language models' (VLMs) comprehension. Conventional wisdom holds its superiority over continual SFT during this preference alignment stage. In this paper, we observe that the inherent value of multimodal RLHF lies in its negative supervision, the logit of the rejected responses. We thus propose a novel negative supervised finetuning (nSFT) approach that fully excavates these information resided. Our nSFT disentangles this negative supervision in RLHF paradigm, and continually aligns VLMs with a simple SFT loss. This is more memory efficient than multimodal RLHF where 2 (e.g., DPO) or 4 (e.g., PPO) large VLMs are strictly required. The effectiveness of nSFT is rigorously proved by comparing it with various multimodal RLHF approaches, across different dataset sources, base VLMs and evaluation metrics. Besides, fruitful of ablations are provided to support our hypothesis. We hope this paper will stimulate further research to properly align large vision language models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Getting More Juice Out of the SFT Data: Reward Learning from Human Demonstration Improves SFT for LLM Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17888v3)** | 2024-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aligning human preference and value is an important requirement for contemporary foundation models. State-of-the-art techniques such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) often consist of two stages: 1) supervised fine-tuning (SFT), where the model is fine-tuned by learning from human demonstration data; 2) Preference learning, where preference data is used to learn a reward model, which is in turn used by a reinforcement learning (RL) step to fine-tune the model. Such reward model serves as a proxy to human preference, and it is critical to guide the RL step towards improving the model quality. In this work, we argue that the SFT stage significantly benefits from learning a reward model as well. Instead of using the human demonstration data directly via supervised learning, we propose to leverage an Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) technique to simultaneously build an reward model and a policy model. This approach leads to new SFT algorithms that are not only efficient to implement, but are robust to the presence of low-quality supervised learning data. Moreover, we discover a connection between the proposed IRL based approach, and a recent line of works called Self-Play Fine-tune (SPIN). Theoretically, we show that the proposed algorithms converge to the stationary solutions of the IRL problem. Empirically, we align 1B and 7B models using proposed methods and evaluate them on a reward benchmark model and the HuggingFace Open LLM Leaderboard. The proposed methods show significant performance improvement over existing SFT approaches. Our results indicate that it is beneficial to leverage reward learning throughout the entire alignment process.</p></details> |  |

In this article with insight from DPO and MinorDPO, we propose a training metric for SFT to measure the discrepancy between the optimized model and the original model, and a loss function MinorSFT that can increase the training effectiveness, and reduce the discrepancy between the optimized LLM and original LLM.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |

However, sourcing this data through human annotation is costly, and existing automated methods often fail to capture the diverse range of contextual granularity and tend to produce homogeneous data. To tackle these issues, we introduce a novel method named AugCon, capable of automatically generating context-driven SFT data across multiple levels of granularity with high diversity, quality and fidelity. AugCon begins by generating queries using the Context-Split-Tree (CST), an innovative approach for recursively deriving queries and splitting context to cover full granularity. Then, we train a scorer through contrastive learning to collaborate with CST to rank and refine queries. Finally, a synergistic integration of self-alignment and self-improving is introduced to obtain high-fidelity responses. Extensive experiments are conducted incorporating both human and automatic evaluations, encompassing a test scenario and four widely-used benchmarks in English and Chinese. The results highlight the significant advantages of AugCon in producing high diversity, quality, and fidelity SFT data against several state-of-the-art methods. All of our code, dataset, and fine-tuned model will be available at: https://github.com/quanshr/AugCon.</p></details> |  |

It typically consists of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) stages. However, RLHF faces inherent limitations stemming from a complex training setup and its tendency to align the model with implicit values that end users cannot control at run-time. Moreover, reward models in RLHF stage commonly rely on single-dimensional feedback as opposed to explicit, multifaceted signals that indicate attributes such as helpfulness, humor, and toxicity. To address these limitations, we propose SteerLM, a supervised fine-tuning method that empowers end-users to control responses during inference. SteerLM conditions responses to conform to an explicitly defined multi-dimensional set of attributes, thereby empowering a steerable AI capable of generating helpful and high-quality responses while maintaining customizability. Experiments show that SteerLM trained on open source datasets generates responses that are preferred by human and automatic evaluators to many state-of-the-art baselines trained with RLHF while being much easier to train.

However, as the number of cascades increases, the improvements in reconstruction tend to become marginal, indicating possible excess model capacity. Knowledge distillation (KD) is an emerging technique to compress these models, in which a trained deep teacher network is used to distill knowledge to a smaller student network such that the student learns to mimic the behavior of the teacher. Most KD methods focus on effectively training the student with a pre-trained teacher unaware of the student model. We propose SFT-KD-Recon, a student-friendly teacher training approach along with the student as a prior step to KD to make the teacher aware of the structure and capacity of the student and enable aligning the representations of the teacher with the student. In SFT, the teacher is jointly trained with the unfolded branch configurations of the student blocks using three loss terms - teacher-reconstruction loss, student-reconstruction loss, and teacher-student imitation loss, followed by KD of the student. We perform extensive experiments for MRI acceleration in 4x and 5x under-sampling on the brain and cardiac datasets on five KD methods using the proposed approach as a prior step. We consider the DC-CNN architecture and setup teacher as D5C5 (141765 parameters), and student as D3C5 (49285 parameters), denoting a compression of 2.87:1. Results show that (i) our approach consistently improves the KD methods with improved reconstruction performance and image quality, and (ii) the student distilled using our approach is competitive with the teacher, with the performance gap reduced from 0.53 dB to 0.03 dB.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 8 figures.

In particular we prove that all generalized Baumslag-Solitar groups (GBS) admit a strongly aperiodic SFT. Our proof is based on a structural theorem by Whyte and on two constructions of strongly aperiodic SFTs on $\mathbb{F}_n\times \mathbb{Z}$ and $BS(m,n)$ of our own. Our two constructions rely on a path-folding technique that lifts an SFT on $\mathbb{Z}^2$ inside an SFT on $\mathbb{F}_n\times \mathbb{Z}$ or an SFT on the hyperbolic plane inside an SFT on $BS(m,n)$. In the case of $\mathbb{F}_n\times \mathbb{Z}$ the path folding technique also preserves minimality, so that we get minimal strongly aperiodic SFTs on unimodular GBS groups.</p></details> | 31 pages, 13 figures |

To be more precise, we prove that given any \pizu subset $P$ of $\{0,1\}^\NN$ there is a SFT $X$ such that $P\times\ZZ^2$ is recursively homeomorphic to $X\setminus U$ where $U$ is a computable set of points. As a consequence, if $P$ contains a recursive member, $P$ and $X$ have the exact same set of Turing degrees. On the other hand, we prove that if $X$ contains only non-recursive members, some of its members always have different but comparable degrees. This gives a fairly complete study of Turing degrees of SFTs.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1102.1189</p></details> |

| **[Opal: An Operator Algebra View of RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11298v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Opal, an operator view of reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Objectives are expressed as ladders of two primitives on a base utility: additive penalties and multiplicative pairwise weights. We describe a simple reduction law with if-and-only-if conditions: such ladders collapse to a normal form on pairwise margins when the reference is fixed, penalties are additive, and weights are independent of intermediate margins. When these assumptions do not hold (reference shift, non-additive gates, score-dependent weights), small examples demonstrate non-reducibility. Building on this view, we introduce GKPO (Generalized Kernel Preference Object), a canonical schema in which many RLHF methods can be represented and, when reducible, mapped back from. GKPO provides a standard JSON serialization, canonicalization and hashing rules, and explicit flags with finite witnesses when assumptions fail. We illustrate these ideas with GKPO examples for DPO, RRHF, and ORPO, along with cross-method conversions (where assumptions permit) and minimal stress tests (SHIFT/GATE/SCORE) that highlight non-reducibility. A lightweight Python reference library accompanies the schema, implementing canonical hashing and adapters for DPO and RRHF.</p></details> | 11 pages main |

The state-of-the-art, MaxMin-RLHF, addresses this by learning group-specific reward models, and by optimizing for the group receiving the minimum reward, thereby promoting fairness. However, we identify that a key limitation of MaxMin-RLHF is its poor performance when the minimum-reward group is a minority. To mitigate this drawback, we introduce a novel framework, termed {\em SharedRep-RLHF}. At its core, SharedRep-RLHF learns and leverages {\em shared traits} in annotations among various groups, in contrast to learning separate reward models across groups. We first show that MaxMin-RLHF is provably suboptimal in learning shared traits, and then quantify the sample complexity of SharedRep-RLHF. Experiments across diverse natural language tasks showcase the effectiveness of SharedRep-RLHF compared to MaxMin-RLHF with a gain of up to 20% in win rate.</p></details> |  |
| **[Balanced Actor Initialization: Stable RLHF Training of Distillation-Based Reasoning Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00309v1)** | 2025-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of alignment and reasoning capabilities in large language models has seen remarkable progress through two paradigms: instruction tuning and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) alignment paradigm, and distillation-based reasoning fine-tuning paradigm. While both approaches prove effective independently, the third paradigm of applying RLHF to distillation-trained models presents significant challenges. Our investigation reveals two critical phenomena that emerge in this paradigm: Sequence Length Collapse, where language generation dramatically reduces during early RLHF training, and the Reward Hockey Stick Curve, featuring severe reward score drops followed by gradual recovery. These instabilities fundamentally compromise the model's alignment and reasoning capabilities. To address these challenges, we propose Balanced Actor Initialization (BAI), a two-stage weighted model merging approach. BAI first merges instruction-following and distillation-based reasoning fine-tuned models, then further combines this intermediate model with the pretrained model to preserve foundational knowledge. Through comprehensive experiments across diverse benchmarks and detailed analysis of training experiments, we demonstrate that BAI resolves Sequence Length Collapse, mitigates the Reward Hockey Stick Curve, and enables continuous sequence length improvement during training. Additionally, our analysis reveals that balanced merging ratios achieve optimal trade-offs between training stability and reasoning capability preservation. Our work provides the effective solution for stable training in this third paradigm, enabling more capable reasoning models that combine distillation efficiency with RLHF alignment.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Algorithmic Bias of Aligning Large Language Models with RLHF: Preference Collapse and Matching Regularization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16455v2)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences is crucial for informing fair, economically sound, and statistically efficient decision-making processes. However, we argue that the predominant approach for aligning LLMs with human preferences through a reward model -- reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) -- suffers from an inherent algorithmic bias due to its Kullback--Leibler-based regularization in optimization. In extreme cases, this bias could lead to a phenomenon we term preference collapse, where minority preferences are virtually disregarded. To mitigate this algorithmic bias, we introduce preference matching (PM) RLHF, a novel approach that provably aligns LLMs with the preference distribution of the reward model under the Bradley--Terry--Luce/Plackett--Luce model. Central to our approach is a PM regularizer that takes the form of the negative logarithm of the LLM's policy probability distribution over responses, which helps the LLM balance response diversification and reward maximization. Notably, we obtain this regularizer by solving an ordinary differential equation that is necessary for the PM property. For practical implementation, we introduce a conditional variant of PM RLHF that is tailored to natural language generation. Finally, we empirically validate the effectiveness of conditional PM RLHF through experiments on the OPT and Llama-family models, demonstrating a 29% to 41% improvement in alignment with human preferences, as measured by a certain metric, compared to standard RLHF.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the Journal of the American Statistical Association</p></details> |

PPO performs well empirically but has a heuristic motivation and handles the KL-divergence constraint used in LM-RLHF in an ad-hoc manner. In this paper, we develop a a new action-value RL method for the LM-RLHF setting, KL-regularised Q-Learning (KLQ). We then show that our method is equivalent to a version of PPO in a certain specific sense, despite its very different motivation. Finally, we benchmark KLQ on two key language generation tasks -- summarisation and single-turn dialogue. We demonstrate that KLQ performs on-par with PPO at optimising the LM-RLHF objective, and achieves a consistently higher win-rate against PPO on LLM-as-a-judge evaluations.</p></details> |  |
| **[RLHF Fine-Tuning of LLMs for Alignment with Implicit User Feedback in Conversational Recommenders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05289v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conversational recommender systems (CRS) based on Large Language Models (LLMs) need to constantly be aligned to the user preferences to provide satisfying and context-relevant item recommendations. The traditional supervised fine-tuning cannot capture the implicit feedback signal, e.g., dwell time, sentiment polarity, or engagement patterns. In this paper, we share a fine-tuning solution using human feedback reinforcement learning (RLHF) to maximize implied user feedback (IUF) in a multi-turn recommendation context. We specify a reward model $R_{\phi}$ learnt on weakly-labelled engagement information and maximize user-centric utility by optimizing the foundational LLM M_{\theta} through a proximal policy optimization (PPO) approach. The architecture models conversational state transitions $s_t \to a_t \to s_{t +1}$, where the action $a_t$ is associated with LLM-generated item suggestions only on condition of conversation history in the past. The evaluation across synthetic and real-world datasets (e.g.REDIAL, OpenDialKG) demonstrates that our RLHF-fine-tuned models can perform better in terms of top-$k$ recommendation accuracy, coherence, and user satisfaction compared to (arrow-zero-cmwrquca-teja-falset ensuite 2Round group-deca States penalty give up This paper shows that implicit signal alignment can be efficient in achieving scalable and user-adaptive design of CRS.</p></details> |  |
| **[REINFORCE++: An Efficient RLHF Algorithm with Robustness to Both Prompt and Reward Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03262v8)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) plays a crucial role in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values and preferences. While state-of-the-art applications like ChatGPT or GPT-4 commonly employ Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), the inclusion of a critic network introduces significant computational overhead. REINFORCE-based methods, such as REINFORCE Leave One-Out (RLOO), ReMax, and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), address this limitation by eliminating the critic network. However, these approaches face challenges in accurate advantage estimation. Specifically, they estimate advantages independently for responses to each prompt, which can lead to overfitting on simpler prompts and vulnerability to reward hacking and may be biased. To address these challenges, we introduce REINFORCE++, a novel approach that removes the critic model while using the global advantage normalization which is unbiased to improve the training stability. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that REINFORCE++ exhibits robust performance across various reward models without requiring prompt set truncation. Furthermore, it achieves superior generalization in both RLHF and long chain-of-thought (CoT) settings compared to existing REINFORCE-based methods. The implementation is available at https://github.com/OpenRLHF/OpenRLHF.</p></details> | add experiments |

While existing RLHF training systems have enabled significant progress, they often face challenges in scaling to multi-modal and diffusion workflows and adapting to dynamic workloads. In particular, current approaches may encounter limitations in controller scalability, flexible resource placement, and efficient orchestration when handling complex RLHF pipelines, especially in scenarios involving dynamic sampling or generative reward modeling. In this paper, we present \textbf{G-Core}, a simple, scalable, and balanced RLHF training framework designed to address these challenges. G-Core introduces a parallel controller programming model, enabling flexible and efficient orchestration of complex RLHF workflows without the bottlenecks of a single centralized controller. Furthermore, we propose a dynamic placement schema that adaptively partitions resources and schedules workloads, significantly reducing hardware idle time and improving utilization, even under highly variable training conditions. G-Core has successfully trained models that support WeChat product features serving a large-scale user base, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness in real-world scenarios. Our results show that G-Core advances the state of the art in RLHF training, providing a solid foundation for future research and deployment of large-scale, human-aligned models.</p></details> | <details><summary>I hav...</summary><p>I haven't received company approval yet, and I uploaded it by mistake</p></details> |
| **[Harnessing RLHF for Robust Unanswerability Recognition and Trustworthy Response Generation in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16951v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conversational Information Retrieval (CIR) systems, while offering intuitive access to information, face a significant challenge: reliably handling unanswerable questions to prevent the generation of misleading or hallucinated content. Traditional approaches often rely on external classifiers, which can introduce inconsistencies with the core generative Large Language Models (LLMs). This paper introduces Self-Aware LLM for Unanswerability (SALU), a novel approach that deeply integrates unanswerability detection directly within the LLM's generative process. SALU is trained using a multi-task learning framework for both standard Question Answering (QA) and explicit abstention generation for unanswerable queries. Crucially, it incorporates a confidence-score-guided reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) phase, which explicitly penalizes hallucinated responses and rewards appropriate abstentions, fostering intrinsic self-awareness of knowledge boundaries. Through extensive experiments on our custom-built C-IR_Answerability dataset, SALU consistently outperforms strong baselines, including hybrid LLM-classifier systems, in overall accuracy for correctly answering or abstaining from questions. Human evaluation further confirms SALU's superior reliability, achieving high scores in factuality, appropriate abstention, and, most importantly, a dramatic reduction in hallucination, demonstrating its ability to robustly "know when to say 'I don't know'."</p></details> |  |

We explore two approaches that leverage human gaze modeling to enhance RLHF: (1) gaze-aware reward models and (2) gaze-based distribution of sparse rewards at token level. Our experiments demonstate that gaze-informed RLHF achieves faster convergence while maintaining or slightly improving performance, thus, reducing computational costs during policy optimization. These results show that human gaze provides a valuable and underused signal for policy optimization, pointing to a promising direction for improving RLHF efficiency.</p></details> |  |

However, currently available open-source dLLMs often generate at much lower rates, typically decoding only a single token at every denoising timestep in order to maximize output quality. We present Spiffy, a speculative decoding algorithm that accelerates dLLM inference by $\mathbf{2.8{-}3.1\times}$ while provably preserving the model's output distribution. This work addresses the unique challenges involved in applying ideas from speculative decoding of AR-LLMs to the dLLM setting. Spiffy proposes draft states by leveraging the dLLM's distribution itself in an auto-speculative manner. This approach is efficient and effective, and eliminates the overheads of training and running an independent draft model. To structure the candidate draft states, we propose a novel directed draft graph which is uniquely designed to take advantage of the bidirectional, block-wise nature of dLLM generation and can be verified in parallel by the dLLM. To further optimize the structure of these draft graphs, we introduce an efficient, offline calibration algorithm that procedurally determines high-quality graph configurations. These optimized draft graphs, enabling increased acceptance rates, lead to a significant boost in the overall speedup achieved by the system. Crucially, Spiffy is also complementary to other recent innovations in improving dLLM generation speeds such as KV-caching and multi-token unmasking. We demonstrate that when combined with such parallel decoding algorithms, Spiffy is able to effectively multiply the benefits of these methods leading to total speedups of up to $\mathbf{7.9\times}$.</p></details> |  |

Unlike existing benchmarks that focus on games or isolated puzzles, Reasoning Core procedurally generates problems across core formal domains, including PDDL planning, first-order logic, context-free grammar parsing, causal reasoning, and system equation solving. The environment is built on key design principles of high-generality problem distributions, verification via external tools, and continuous difficulty control, which together provide a virtually infinite supply of novel training instances. Initial zero-shot evaluations with frontier LLMs confirm the difficulty of Reasoning Core's tasks, positioning it as a promising resource to improve the reasoning capabilities of future models.</p></details> |  |

Knowledge Graphs (KGs) provide structured external knowledge, yet their complexity and multi-hop reasoning requirements make integration challenging. We present ARK-V1, a simple KG-agent that iteratively explores graphs to answer natural language queries. We evaluate several not fine-tuned state-of-the art LLMs as backbones for ARK-V1 on the CoLoTa dataset, which requires both KG-based and commonsense reasoning over long-tail entities. ARK-V1 achieves substantially higher conditional accuracies than Chain-of-Thought baselines, and larger backbone models show a clear trend toward better coverage, correctness, and stability.</p></details> | Work in Progess |

However, when faced with malicious requests, models are trained to refuse, sacrificing helpfulness. We show that frontier LLMs can develop a preference for dishonesty as a new strategy, even when other options are available. Affected models respond to harmful requests with outputs that sound harmful but are subtly incorrect or otherwise harmless in practice. This behavior emerges with hard-to-predict variations even within models from the same model family. We find no apparent cause for the propensity to deceive, but we show that more capable models are better at executing this strategy. Strategic dishonesty already has a practical impact on safety evaluations, as we show that dishonest responses fool all output-based monitors used to detect jailbreaks that we test, rendering benchmark scores unreliable. Further, strategic dishonesty can act like a honeypot against malicious users, which noticeably obfuscates prior jailbreak attacks. While output monitors fail, we show that linear probes on internal activations can be used to reliably detect strategic dishonesty. We validate probes on datasets with verifiable outcomes and by using their features as steering vectors. Overall, we consider strategic dishonesty as a concrete example of a broader concern that alignment of LLMs is hard to control, especially when helpfulness and harmlessness conflict.</p></details> |  |
| **[The PIMMUR Principles: Ensuring Validity in Collective Behavior of LLM Societies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18052v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for social simulation, where populations of agents are expected to reproduce human-like collective behavior. However, we find that many recent studies adopt experimental designs that systematically undermine the validity of their claims. From a survey of over 40 papers, we identify six recurring methodological flaws: agents are often homogeneous (Profile), interactions are absent or artificially imposed (Interaction), memory is discarded (Memory), prompts tightly control outcomes (Minimal-Control), agents can infer the experimental hypothesis (Unawareness), and validation relies on simplified theoretical models rather than real-world data (Realism). For instance, GPT-4o and Qwen-3 correctly infer the underlying social experiment in 53.1% of cases when given instructions from prior work-violating the Unawareness principle. We formalize these six requirements as the PIMMUR principles and argue they are necessary conditions for credible LLM-based social simulation. To demonstrate their impact, we re-run five representative studies using a framework that enforces PIMMUR and find that the reported social phenomena frequently fail to emerge under more rigorous conditions. Our work establishes methodological standards for LLM-based multi-agent research and provides a foundation for more reliable and reproducible claims about "AI societies."</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Beyond Diagnosis: Evaluating Multimodal LLMs for Pathology Localization in Chest Radiographs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18015v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent work has shown promising performance of frontier large language models (LLMs) and their multimodal counterparts in medical quizzes and diagnostic tasks, highlighting their potential for broad clinical utility given their accessible, general-purpose nature. However, beyond diagnosis, a fundamental aspect of medical image interpretation is the ability to localize pathological findings. Evaluating localization not only has clinical and educational relevance but also provides insight into a model's spatial understanding of anatomy and disease. Here, we systematically assess two general-purpose MLLMs (GPT-4 and GPT-5) and a domain-specific model (MedGemma) in their ability to localize pathologies on chest radiographs, using a prompting pipeline that overlays a spatial grid and elicits coordinate-based predictions. Averaged across nine pathologies in the CheXlocalize dataset, GPT-5 exhibited a localization accuracy of 49.7%, followed by GPT-4 (39.1%) and MedGemma (17.7%), all lower than a task-specific CNN baseline (59.9%) and a radiologist benchmark (80.1%). Despite modest performance, error analysis revealed that GPT-5's predictions were largely in anatomically plausible regions, just not always precisely localized. GPT-4 performed well on pathologies with fixed anatomical locations, but struggled with spatially variable findings and exhibited anatomically implausible predictions more frequently. MedGemma demonstrated the lowest performance on all pathologies, showing limited capacity to generalize to this novel task. Our findings highlight both the promise and limitations of current MLLMs in medical imaging and underscore the importance of integrating them with task-specific tools for reliable use.</p></details> |  |

Although large language models (LLMs) are an attractive tool for measuring scalar constructs, their idiosyncratic treatment of numerical outputs raises questions of how to best apply them. We address these questions with a comprehensive evaluation of LLM-based approaches to scalar construct measurement in social science. Using multiple datasets sourced from the political science literature, we evaluate four approaches: unweighted direct pointwise scoring, aggregation of pairwise comparisons, token-probability-weighted pointwise scoring, and finetuning. Our study finds that pairwise comparisons made by LLMs produce better measurements than simply prompting the LLM to directly output the scores, which suffers from bunching around arbitrary numbers. However, taking the weighted mean over the token probability of scores further improves the measurements over the two previous approaches. Finally, finetuning smaller models with as few as 1,000 training pairs can match or exceed the performance of prompted LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2025 (Main)</p></details> |

Traditional BO methods often rely on fixed or heuristic kernel selection strategies, which can result in slow convergence or suboptimal solutions when the chosen kernel is poorly suited to the underlying objective function. To address this limitation, we propose a freshly-baked Context-Aware Kernel Evolution (CAKE) to enhance BO with large language models (LLMs). Concretely, CAKE leverages LLMs as the crossover and mutation operators to adaptively generate and refine GP kernels based on the observed data throughout the optimization process. To maximize the power of CAKE, we further propose BIC-Acquisition Kernel Ranking (BAKER) to select the most effective kernel through balancing the model fit measured by the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) with the expected improvement at each iteration of BO. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our fresh CAKE-based BO method consistently outperforms established baselines across a range of real-world tasks, including hyperparameter optimization, controller tuning, and photonic chip design.

| **[Training-free Truthfulness Detection via Value Vectors in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17932v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models often generate factually incorrect outputs, motivating efforts to detect the truthfulness of their content. Most existing approaches rely on training probes over internal activations, but these methods suffer from scalability and generalization issues. A recent training-free method, NoVo, addresses this challenge by exploiting statistical patterns from the model itself. However, it focuses exclusively on attention mechanisms, potentially overlooking the MLP module-a core component of Transformer models known to support factual recall. In this paper, we show that certain value vectors within MLP modules exhibit truthfulness-related statistical patterns. Building on this insight, we propose TruthV, a simple and interpretable training-free method that detects content truthfulness by leveraging these value vectors. On the NoVo benchmark, TruthV significantly outperforms both NoVo and log-likelihood baselines, demonstrating that MLP modules-despite being neglected in prior training-free efforts-encode rich and useful signals for truthfulness detection. These findings offer new insights into how truthfulness is internally represented in LLMs and motivate further research on scalable and interpretable truthfulness detection.</p></details> |  |

To strengthen this alignment, recent works propose Audio Difference Captioning (ADC), which takes multiple audio inputs and encourages the model to describe their differences, thereby promoting fine-grained discrimination. However, despite its effectiveness, ADC introduces a semantic gap between input audios-often rich in diverse events-and the brief, difference-focused short caption. This deviation from AC-style task causes a mismatch with the pretraining objective, leading to catastrophic forgetting. To address this, we propose Audio Commonality Captioning (ACC), a comparably challenging but gentler alternative that guides the model to capture shared semantics across audio clips rather than detailed differences. Experiments show that ACC not only improves audio-text understanding on captioning benchmarks but also better preserves general capabilities across diverse speech and music tasks, confirming its ability to enable more robust cross-modal understanding and achieve a better balance between generalization and task-specific performance in MLLMs.</p></details> |  |

Manual rewriting, guided by synthesis feedback, can yield high-quality results but is time-consuming and error-prone. Most existing compiler-based approaches have difficulty handling complex design constraints. Large Language Model (LLM)-based methods have emerged as a promising alternative to address these challenges. However, LLM-based approaches often face difficulties in ensuring alignment between the generated code and the provided prompts. This paper presents SymRTLO, a novel neuron-symbolic RTL optimization framework that seamlessly integrates LLM-based code rewriting with symbolic reasoning techniques. Our method incorporates a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system of optimization rules and Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)-based templates, enabling LLM-based rewriting that maintains syntactic correctness while minimizing undesired circuit behaviors. A symbolic module is proposed for analyzing and optimizing finite state machine (FSM) logic, allowing fine-grained state merging and partial specification handling beyond the scope of pattern-based compilers. Furthermore, a fast verification pipeline, combining formal equivalence checks with test-driven validation, further reduces the complexity of verification. Experiments on the RTL-Rewriter benchmark with Synopsys Design Compiler and Yosys show that SymRTLO improves power, performance, and area (PPA) by up to 43.9%, 62.5%, and 51.1%, respectively, compared to the state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |

We ask a direct question: how much does audio actually matter for contemporary Video-LLMs and the benchmarks that certify them? We audit widely used suites and observe that many items are even solvable from a single frame, rendering audio largely redundant. Building on LLaVA-OneVision architecture, we attach a speech/audio encoder (e.g., Whisper) and analyze when audio helps, while addressing audio token explosion with a lightweight Mamba-based state-space token compressor. We find that audio yields minimal gains on recent video benchmarks but is decisive on curated, audio-sensitive subsets. To enable faithful evaluation, we release AVQA-Hard and Music-AVQA-Hard, our model, and code. Our findings surface a growing gap between current academic practice and real-world expectations, and provide practical tools for scalable audio-visual Video-LLMs. We will fully open-source our work at https://github.com/naver-ai/LLaVA-AV-SSM.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 2 figures, under review.

To address this limitation, we introduce two large-scale resources: SensorCap, comprising 35,960 IMU--caption pairs, and OpenSQA, with 199,701 question--answer pairs designed for causal and explanatory reasoning. OpenSQA includes a curated tuning split (Tune-OpenSQA) optimized for scientific accuracy, narrative clarity, and diagnostic insight. Leveraging these datasets, we develop LLaSA (Large Language and Sensor Assistant), a family of compact sensor-aware language models (7B and 13B) that generate interpretable, context-rich responses to open-ended questions grounded in raw IMU data. LLaSA outperforms commercial LLMs, including GPT-3.5 and GPT-4o-mini, on benchmark and real-world tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of domain supervision and model alignment for sensor reasoning.

As in the previous editions, participants were challenged to develop systems that identify mentions and cluster them according to identity coreference. A key innovation of this year's task was the introduction of a dedicated Large Language Model (LLM) track, featuring a simplified plaintext format designed to be more suitable for LLMs than the original CoNLL-U representation. The task also expanded its coverage with three new datasets in two additional languages, using version 1.3 of CorefUD - a harmonized multilingual collection of 22 datasets in 17 languages. In total, nine systems participated, including four LLM-based approaches (two fine-tuned and two using few-shot adaptation). While traditional systems still kept the lead, LLMs showed clear potential, suggesting they may soon challenge established approaches in future editions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CODI-CRAC 2025</p></details> |

This paper introduces the Data Contamination Risk (DCR) framework, a lightweight, interpretable pipeline designed to detect and quantify BDC risk across four granular levels: semantic, informational, data, and label. By synthesizing contamination scores via a fuzzy inference system, DCR produces a unified DCR Factor that adjusts raw accuracy to reflect contamination-aware performance. Validated on 9 LLMs (0.5B-72B) across sentiment analysis, fake news detection, and arithmetic reasoning tasks, the DCR framework reliably diagnoses contamination severity and with accuracy adjusted using the DCR Factor to within 4% average error across the three benchmarks compared to the uncontaminated baseline. Emphasizing computational efficiency and transparency, DCR provides a practical tool for integrating contamination assessment into routine evaluations, fostering fairer comparisons and enhancing the credibility of LLM benchmarking practices.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 Main |

Serious games may serve as tools for combating misinformation, teaching players to recognize common misinformation tactics, and improving their skills of discernment. However, current interventions are designed as single-player, choice-based games, which present players with limited predefined choices. Such restrictions reduce replayability and may lead to an overly simplistic understanding of misinformation and how to debunk them. This study seeks to empower people to understand opinion-influencing and misinformation-debunking processes. We created a Player vs. Player (PvP) game in which participants attempt to generate or debunk misinformation to convince the public opinion represented by LLM. Using a within-subjects mixed-methods study design (N=47), we found that this game significantly raised participants' media literacy and improved their ability to identify misinformation. Qualitative analyses revealed how participants' use of debunking and content creation strategies deepened their understanding of misinformation. This work shows the potential for illuminating contrasting viewpoints of social issues by LLM-based mechanics in PvP games.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACM CHI PLAY 2025</p></details> |

However, comprehensive multilingual evaluation remains challenging due to limited benchmarks and questionable translation quality. To better assess these disparities, we introduce MAKIEval, an automatic multilingual framework for evaluating cultural awareness in LLMs across languages, regions, and topics. MAKIEval evaluates open-ended text generation, capturing how models express culturally grounded knowledge in natural language. Leveraging Wikidata's multilingual structure as a cross-lingual anchor, it automatically identifies cultural entities in model outputs and links them to structured knowledge, enabling scalable, language-agnostic evaluation without manual annotation or translation. We then introduce four metrics that capture complementary dimensions of cultural awareness: granularity, diversity, cultural specificity, and consensus across languages. We assess 7 LLMs developed from different parts of the world, encompassing both open-source and proprietary systems, across 13 languages, 19 countries and regions, and 6 culturally salient topics (e.g., food, clothing). Notably, we find that models tend to exhibit stronger cultural awareness in English, suggesting that English prompts more effectively activate culturally grounded knowledge.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP 2025 Findings, 33 pages, 30 figures</p></details> |
| **[Scaling Efficient LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14746v4)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trained LLMs in the transformer architecture are typically sparse in that most of the parameters are negligible, raising questions on efficiency. Furthermore, the so called "AI scaling law" for transformers suggests that the number of parameters must scale linearly with the size of the data. In response, we inquire into efficient LLMs, i.e. those with the fewest parameters that achieve the desired accuracy on a training corpus. Specifically, by comparing theoretical and empirical estimates of the Kullback-Liebler divergence, we derive a natural AI scaling law that the number of parameters in an efficient LLM scales as $D^{\gamma}$ where $D$ is the size of the training data and $ \gamma \in [0.44, 0.72]$, suggesting the existence of more efficient architectures. Against this backdrop, we propose recurrent transformers, combining the efficacy of transformers with the efficiency of recurrent networks, progressively applying a single transformer layer to a fixed-width sliding window across the input sequence. Recurrent transformers (a) run in linear time in the sequence length, (b) are memory-efficient and amenable to parallel processing in large batches, (c) learn to forget history for language tasks, or accumulate history for long range tasks like copy and selective copy, and (d) are amenable to curriculum training to overcome vanishing gradients. In our experiments, we find that recurrent transformers perform favorably on benchmark tests.</p></details> |  |
| **[ConfClip: Confidence-Weighted and Clipped Reward for Reinforcement Learning in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17730v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a standard paradigm for refining large language models (LLMs) beyond pre-training and instruction tuning. A prominent line of work is RL with verifiable rewards (RLVR), which leverages automatically verifiable outcomes (e.g., correctness or executability) to generate reward signals. While efficient, this framework faces two key limitations: First, its binary feedback is too sparse to capture the quality of the reasoning process. Second, its coarse-grained rewards potentially lead to vanishing gradients. Inspired by observations from human learning, we introduce a RL technique that integrates verifiable outcomes with the model's own confidence estimates. This joint design enriches the reward signal, providing finer-grained feedback and implicitly supervising the reasoning process. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method enhances RL performance across multiple datasets and reduces token consumption during inference, while incurring negligible additional training cost. Moreover, it can be used as a plug-in module to enhance other state-of-the-art RL methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[LightRetriever: A LLM-based Text Retrieval Architecture with Extremely Faster Query Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12260v4)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs)-based text retrieval retrieves documents relevant to search queries based on vector similarities. Documents are pre-encoded offline, while queries arrive in real-time, necessitating an efficient online query encoder. Although LLMs significantly enhance retrieval capabilities, serving deeply parameterized LLMs slows down query inference throughput and increases demands for online deployment resources. In this paper, we propose LightRetriever, a novel LLM-based retriever with extremely lightweight query encoders. Our method retains a full-sized LLM for document encoding, but reduces the workload of query encoding to no more than an embedding lookup. Compared to serving a full LLM on an A800 GPU, our method achieves over 1000x speedup in query encoding and over 10x increase in end-to-end retrieval throughput. Extensive experiments on large-scale retrieval benchmarks show that LightRetriever generalizes well across diverse tasks, maintaining an average of 95% retrieval performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[CoSIL: Issue Localization via LLM-Driven Code Graph Searching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22424v2)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Issue solving aims to generate patches to fix reported issues in real-world code repositories according to issue descriptions. Issue localization forms the basis for accurate issue solving. Recently, LLM-based issue localization methods have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance. However, these methods either search from files mentioned in issue descriptions or in the whole repository and struggle to balance the breadth and depth of the search space to converge on the target efficiently. Moreover, they allow LLM to explore whole repositories freely, making it challenging to control the search direction to prevent the LLM from searching for incorrect targets. This paper introduces CoSIL, an LLM-driven, powerful function-level issue localization method without training or indexing. CoSIL employs a two-phase code graph search strategy. It first conducts broad exploration at the file level using dynamically constructed module call graphs, and then performs in-depth analysis at the function level by expanding the module call graph into a function call graph and executing iterative searches. To precisely control the search direction, CoSIL designs a pruner to filter unrelated directions and irrelevant contexts. To avoid incorrect interaction formats in long contexts, CoSIL introduces a reflection mechanism that uses additional independent queries in short contexts to enhance formatted abilities. Experiment results demonstrate that CoSIL achieves a Top-1 localization accuracy of 43.3\% and 44.6\% on SWE-bench Lite and SWE-bench Verified, respectively, with Qwen2.5-Coder-32B, average outperforming the state-of-the-art methods by 96.04\%. When CoSIL is integrated into an issue-solving method, Agentless, the issue resolution rate improves by 2.98\%--30.5\%.</p></details> | Accepted by ASE 2025 |

We address this question by introducing a novel Large Language Model (LLM)-based agent simulation framework modeling prehistoric hunter-gatherer societies. This platform is designed to probe diverse questions in social evolution, from survival advantages to inter-group dynamics. To investigate moral evolution, we designed agents with varying moral dispositions based on the Expanding Circle Theory \citep{singer1981expanding}. We evaluated their evolutionary success across a series of simulations and analyzed their decision-making in specially designed moral dilemmas. These experiments reveal how an agent's moral framework, in combination with its cognitive constraints, directly shapes its behavior and determines its evolutionary outcome. Crucially, the emergent patterns echo seminal theories from related domains of social science, providing external validation for the simulations. This work establishes LLM-based simulation as a powerful new paradigm to complement traditional research in evolutionary biology and anthropology, opening new avenues for investigating the complexities of moral and social evolution.</p></details> |  |

This study compares LLM-generated and human-authored responses in multi-turn professional training simulations through human evaluation ($N=38$) and automated LLM-as-a-judge assessment. Human evaluation revealed significant degradation in LLM-generated response quality across turns, particularly in naturalness, context maintenance and overall quality, while human-authored responses progressively improved. In line with this finding, participants also indicated a consistent preference for human-authored dialogue. These human judgements were validated by our automated LLM-as-a-judge evaluation, where Gemini 2.0 Flash achieved strong alignment with human evaluators on both zero-shot pairwise preference and stochastic 6-shot construct ratings, confirming the widening quality gap between LLM and human responses over time. Our work contributes a multi-turn benchmark exposing LLM degradation in knowledge-grounded role-play dialogues and provides a validated hybrid evaluation framework to guide the reliable integration of LLMs in training simulations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at the 18th International Natural Language Generation Conference (INLG 2025)</p></details> |

Existing moderators mainly practice a conventional full detection, which determines the harmfulness based on the complete LLM output, causing high service latency. Recent works pay more attention to partial detection where moderators oversee the generation midway and early stop the output if harmfulness is detected, but they directly apply moderators trained with the full detection paradigm to incomplete outputs, introducing a training-inference gap that lowers the performance. In this paper, we explore how to form a data-and-model solution that natively supports partial detection. For the data, we construct FineHarm, a dataset consisting of 29K prompt-response pairs with fine-grained annotations to provide reasonable supervision for token-level training. Then, we propose the streaming content monitor, which is trained with dual supervision of response- and token-level labels and can follow the output stream of LLM to make a timely judgment of harmfulness. Experiments show that SCM gains 0.95+ in macro F1 score that is comparable to full detection, by only seeing the first 18% of tokens in responses on average. Moreover, the SCM can serve as a pseudo-harmfulness annotator for improving safety alignment and lead to a higher harmlessness score than DPO.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 Accepted Paper</p></details> |

However, their reasoning and coordination capabilities in complex, multi-stage scenarios remain underexplored. Existing benchmarks typically focus on isolated tasks or narrow domains, overlooking models' abilities for multi-stage collaboration and optimization without explicit external guidance. To bridge this gap, we propose \textbf{MSCoRe}, a novel benchmark comprising 126696 domain-specific QA instances spanning scenarios in automotive, pharmaceutical, electronics, and energy sectors. The dataset is created using a structured three-phase pipeline: dynamic sampling, iterative question-answer generation, and a multi-level quality assessment to ensure data quality. Tasks are further categorized into three difficulty levels according to stage coverage and complexity. With MSCoRe, we have conducted a comprehensive evaluation of various state-of-the-art LLM agents. The commercial models performed best across all tasks and scenarios, but a notable gap in ROUGE scores remains between simple and complex tasks. We also tested the models' robustness and found that their performance is negatively affected by noisy data. MSCoRe provides a valuable new resource for the community to evaluate and improve multi-stage reasoning in LLM agents.

A Case Study with In-Context Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17552v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The remarkable performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) can be enhanced with test-time computation, which relies on external tools and even other deep learning models. However, existing approaches for integrating non-text modality representations into LLMs typically require additional costly supervised training, restricting on-the-fly adaptation to new domains and modalities. In this work, we explore the feasibility of integrating representations from non-text foundational models (FMs) into text-based LLMs in a training-free manner. We propose In-Context Representation Learning (ICRL) as a proof-of-concept to allow LLMs to adaptively utilize non-text modality representations with few-shot learning. Unlike traditional in-context learning, which incorporates text-label pairs, ICRL replaces text inputs with FM representations, enabling the LLM to perform multi-modal inference without fine-tuning. We evaluate ICRL on a suite of tasks in the molecular domain, investigating three core research questions: (i) how to map FM representations into LLMs in a training-free manner, (ii) what factors influence ICRL performance, and (iii) what mechanisms underlie the effectiveness of ICRL. To the best of our knowledge, ICRL is the first training-free framework for integrating non-text modality representations into text-based LLMs, presenting a promising direction for adaptable, multi-modal generalization.</p></details> | NIPS 2025 |

The article explores how to model the CR task for LLMs via five different instruction sets using a controlled inference method. The approach is evaluated across three LLMs; Llama 3.1, Gemma 2, and Mistral 0.3. The results indicate that LLMs, when instruction-tuned with a suitable instruction set, can surpass state-of-the-art task-specific architectures.

While these capabilities offer exciting opportunities, they also raise critical concerns about fairness and reliability. In this paper, we investigate bias in LLM-generated peer reviews by conducting controlled experiments on sensitive metadata, including author affiliation and gender. Our analysis consistently shows affiliation bias favoring institutions highly ranked on common academic rankings. Additionally, we find some gender preferences, which, even though subtle in magnitude, have the potential to compound over time.

| **[SATBench: Benchmarking LLMs' Logical Reasoning via Automated Puzzle Generation from SAT Formulas](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14615v2)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce SATBench, a benchmark for evaluating the logical reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) through logical puzzles derived from Boolean satisfiability (SAT) problems. Unlike prior work that focuses on inference rule-based reasoning, which often involves deducing conclusions from a set of premises, our approach leverages the search-based nature of SAT problems, where the objective is to find a solution that fulfills a specified set of logical constraints. Each instance in SATBench is generated from a SAT formula, then translated into a puzzle using LLMs. The generation process is fully automated and allows for adjustable difficulty by varying the number of clauses. All 2100 puzzles are validated through both LLM-based and solver-based consistency checks, with human validation on a subset. Experimental results show that even the strongest model, o4-mini, achieves only 65.0% accuracy on hard UNSAT problems, close to the random baseline of 50%. Our error analysis reveals systematic failures such as satisfiability bias, context inconsistency, and condition omission, highlighting limitations of current LLMs in search-based logical reasoning.

We present MapCoder-Lite, which upgrades a single 7B model into four role-specialised agents-retriever, planner, coder, and debugger-using only rank-32, role-specific LoRA adapters ($<3\%$ extra parameters). Three lightweight techniques make this possible: (i) trajectory distillation from strong LLMs fixes format fragility in retrieval and debugging, (ii) supervisor-guided correction strengthens planning and coding agents, and (iii) agent-wise LoRA fine-tuning delivers memory-efficient specialisation. Comprehensive evaluation on xCodeEval, APPS, and CodeContests shows that MapCoder-Lite more than doubles xCodeEval accuracy (from $13.2\%$ to $28.3\%$), eliminates all format failures, and closes to within six points of a 32B baseline while cutting GPU memory and token-generation time by $4\times$. These results demonstrate that careful agent-wise fine-tuning unleashes high-quality multi-agent coding on a small language model.</p></details> |  |

While recent work reveals significant gaps between LLMs' privacy Q&A performance and their agent behavior, existing benchmarks remain limited to static, simplified scenarios. We present PrivacyChecker, a model-agnostic, contextual integrity based mitigation approach that effectively reduces privacy leakage from 36.08% to 7.30% on DeepSeek-R1 and from 33.06% to 8.32% on GPT-4o, all while preserving task helpfulness. We also introduce PrivacyLens-Live, transforming static benchmarks into dynamic MCP and A2A environments that reveal substantially higher privacy risks in practical. Our modular mitigation approach integrates seamlessly into agent protocols through three deployment strategies, providing practical privacy protection for the emerging agentic ecosystem. Our data and code will be made available at https://aka.ms/privacy_in_action.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at EMNLP 2025 (Findings)</p></details> |

However, despite their wide capabilities, they are shown to lack cultural alignment \citep{ryan-etal-2024-unintended, alkhamissi-etal-2024-investigating} and produce biased generations \cite{naous-etal-2024-beer} due to a lack of cultural knowledge and competence. Evaluation of LLMs for cultural awareness and alignment is particularly challenging due to the lack of proper evaluation metrics and unavailability of culturally grounded datasets representing the vast complexity of cultures at the regional and sub-regional levels. Existing datasets for culture specific items (CSIs) focus primarily on concepts at the regional level and may contain false positives. To address this issue, we introduce a novel CSI dataset for Indian culture, belonging to 17 cultural facets. The dataset comprises $\sim$8k cultural concepts from 36 sub-regions. To measure the cultural competence of LLMs on a cultural text adaptation task, we evaluate the adaptations using the CSIs created, LLM as Judge, and human evaluations from diverse socio-demographic region. Furthermore, we perform quantitative analysis demonstrating selective sub-regional coverage and surface-level adaptations across all considered LLMs. Our dataset is available here: \href{https://huggingface.co/datasets/nlip/DIWALI}{https://huggingface.co/datasets/nlip/DIWALI}, project webpage\footnote{\href{https://nlip-lab.github.io/nlip/publications/diwali/}{https://nlip-lab.github.io/nlip/publications/diwali/}}, and our codebase with model outputs can be found here: \href{https://github.com/pramitsahoo/culture-evaluation}{https://github.com/pramitsahoo/culture-evaluation}.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP 2025</p></details> |
| **[Correlation or Causation: Analyzing the Causal Structures of LLM and LRM Reasoning Process](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17380v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs suffer from critical reasoning issues such as unfaithfulness, bias, and inconsistency, since they lack robust causal underpinnings and may rely on superficial correlations rather than genuine understanding. Successive LRMs have emerged as a promising alternative, leveraging advanced training techniques such as reinforcement learning (RL) and distillation to improve task accuracy. However, the impact of these training methods on causality remains largely unexplored. In this study, we conduct a systematic causal analysis on LLMs and LRMs, examining structural causal models (SCMs) of four key variables: problem instruction (Z), thinking process (T), reasoning steps (X), and answer (Y). Our findings reveal that RLVR-trained LRMs exhibit enhanced causal reasoning capabilities, aligning more closely with ideal causal structures, while LLMs and distilled LRMs fail to address causality-related deficiencies. Our further investigation indicates that RLVR reduces spurious correlations and strengthens genuine causal patterns, thereby mitigating unfaithfulness and bias. In addition, our inspection on the dynamics of the RLVR training process observes a high correlation between reduced spurious features and improved causal structures, where the causal relationships consistently improve in the training process. This study contributes to the understanding of causality in reasoning models, highlights the critical role of RLVR in enhancing causal reasoning, and provides insights for designing future AI systems with stronger causal foundations. We release our code and data at https://github.com/Harryking1999/CoT_Causal_Analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Asteria: Semantic-Aware Cross-Region Caching for Agentic LLM Tool Access](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17360v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM) agents tackle data-intensive tasks such as deep research and code generation. However, their effectiveness depends on frequent interactions with knowledge sources across remote clouds or regions. Such interactions can create non-trivial latency and cost bottlenecks. Existing caching solutions focus on exact-match queries, limiting their effectiveness for semantic knowledge reuse. To address this challenge, we introduce Asteria, a novel cross-region knowledge caching architecture for LLM agents. At its core are two abstractions: Semantic Element (SE) and Semantic Retrieval Index (Sine). A semantic element captures the semantic embedding representation of an LLM query together with performance-aware metadata such as latency, cost, and staticity. Sine then provides two-stage retrieval: a vector similar index with semantic embedding for fast candidate selection and a lightweight LLM-powered semantic judger for precise validation. Atop these primitives, Asteria builds a new cache interface that includes a new semantic-aware cache hit definition, a cost-efficient eviction policy, and proactive prefetching. To reduce overhead, Asteria co-locates the small LLM judger with the main LLM using adaptive scheduling and resource sharing. Our evaluation demonstrates that Asteria delivers substantial performance improvements without compromising correctness. On representative search workloads, Asteria achieves up to a 3.6$\times$ increase in throughput by maintaining cache hit rates of over 85%, while preserving accuracy virtually identical to non-cached baselines. Asteria also improves throughput for complex coding tasks by 20%, showcasing its versatility across diverse agentic workloads.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cronus: Efficient LLM inference on Heterogeneous GPU Clusters via Partially Disaggregated Prefill](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17357v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient LLM inference is critical for real-world applications, especially within heterogeneous GPU clusters commonly found in organizations and on-premise datacenters as GPU architecture rapidly evolves. Current disaggregated prefill strategies, which separate the prefill and decode stages of LLM inference across different GPUs, often suffer from suboptimal performance due to imbalances between GPU capabilities and workload demands. On the other hand, extending conventional data parallelism and pipeline parallelism to heterogeneous setups incurs high inference latencies. To address these challenges, we introduce Cronus, a novel LLM inference system designed to dynamically balance workloads across heterogeneous GPUs using partially disaggregated prefill. Cronus partitions each prefill stage and executes its initial portion on the low-end GPU, while overlapping the remaining prefill and decode stages of earlier requests on the high-end GPU. Extensive evaluations across various high-end and low-end GPU combinations demonstrate that Cronus significantly improves the throughput over disaggregated prefill. It also reduces TTFT P99 and TBT P99 significantly over DP and PP while maintaining similar or better throughput.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLaVul: A Multimodal LLM for Interpretable Vulnerability Reasoning about Source Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17337v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Increasing complexity in software systems places a growing demand on reasoning tools that unlock vulnerabilities manifest in source code. Many current approaches focus on vulnerability analysis as a classifying task, oversimplifying the nuanced and context-dependent real-world scenarios. Even though current code large language models (LLMs) excel in code understanding, they often pay little attention to security-specific reasoning. We propose LLaVul, a multimodal LLM tailored to provide fine-grained reasoning about code through question-answering (QA). Our model is trained to integrate paired code and natural queries into a unified space, enhancing reasoning and context-dependent insights about code vulnerability. To evaluate our model performance, we construct a curated dataset of real-world vulnerabilities paired with security-focused questions and answers. Our model outperforms state-of-the-art general-purpose and code LLMs in the QA and detection tasks. We further explain decision-making by conducting qualitative analysis to highlight capabilities and limitations. By integrating code and QA, LLaVul enables more interpretable and security-focused code understanding.</p></details> |  |
| **[BASFuzz: Towards Robustness Evaluation of LLM-based NLP Software via Automated Fuzz Testing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17335v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fuzzing has shown great success in evaluating the robustness of intelligent natural language processing (NLP) software. As large language model (LLM)-based NLP software is widely deployed in critical industries, existing methods still face two main challenges: 1 testing methods are insufficiently coupled with the behavioral patterns of LLM-based NLP software; 2 fuzzing capability for the testing scenario of natural language generation (NLG) generally degrades. To address these issues, we propose BASFuzz, an efficient Fuzz testing method tailored for LLM-based NLP software. BASFuzz targets complete test inputs composed of prompts and examples, and uses a text consistency metric to guide mutations of the fuzzing loop, aligning with the behavioral patterns of LLM-based NLP software. A Beam-Annealing Search algorithm, which integrates beam search and simulated annealing, is employed to design an efficient fuzzing loop. In addition, information entropy-based adaptive adjustment and an elitism strategy further enhance fuzzing capability. We evaluate BASFuzz on six datasets in representative scenarios of NLG and natural language understanding (NLU). Experimental results demonstrate that BASFuzz achieves a testing effectiveness of 90.335% while reducing the average time overhead by 2,163.852 seconds compared to the current best baseline, enabling more effective robustness evaluation prior to software deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Clotho: Measuring Task-Specific Pre-Generation Test Adequacy for LLM Inputs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17314v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software increasingly relies on the emergent capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), from natural language understanding to program analysis and generation. Yet testing them on specific tasks remains difficult and costly: many prompts lack ground truth, forcing reliance on human judgment, while existing uncertainty and adequacy measures typically require full inference. A key challenge is to assess input adequacy in a way that reflects the demands of the task, ideally before even generating any output. We introduce CLOTHO, a task-specific, pre-generation adequacy measure that estimates input difficulty directly from hidden LLM states. Given a large pool of unlabelled inputs for a specific task, CLOTHO uses a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to adaptively sample the most informative cases for human labelling. Based on this reference set the GMM can then rank unseen inputs by their likelihood of failure. In our empirical evaluation across eight benchmark tasks and three open-weight LLMs, CLOTHO can predict failures with a ROC-AUC of 0.716, after labelling reference sets that are on average only 5.4% of inputs. It does so without generating any outputs, thereby reducing costs compared to existing uncertainty measures. Comparison of CLOTHO and post-generation uncertainty measures shows that the two approaches complement each other. Crucially, we show that adequacy scores learnt from open-weight LLMs transfer effectively to proprietary models, extending the applicability of the approach. When prioritising test inputs for proprietary models, CLOTHO increases the average number of failing inputs from 18.7 to 42.5 out of 100, compared to random prioritisation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mitigating Forgetting in LLM Fine-Tuning via Low-Perplexity Token Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14315v4)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Maintaining consistent model performance across domains is a fundamental challenge in machine learning. While recent work has explored using LLM-generated data for fine-tuning, its impact on cross-domain generalization remains poorly understood. This paper presents a systematic analysis revealing that fine-tuning with LLM-generated data not only improves target task performance but also reduces non-target task degradation compared to fine-tuning with ground truth data. Through analyzing the data sequence in tasks of various domains, we demonstrate that this enhancement of non-target task robustness stems from the reduction of high perplexity tokens found in LLM-generated sequences. Following our findings, we showed that masking high perplexity tokens in ground truth training data achieves similar non-target task performance preservation, comparable to using LLM-generated data. Extensive experiments across different model families and scales, including Gemma 2 IT 2B, Llama 3 8B Instruct, and 3 additional models, agree with our findings. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to provide an empirical explanation based on token perplexity reduction to mitigate catastrophic forgetting in LLMs after fine-tuning, offering valuable insights for developing more robust fine-tuning strategies.</p></details> |  |

We proposed a novel framework that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) with Multiple-Instance Learning (MIL) architecture to enhance interpretability and expression-level reasoning. Each utterance was decomposed into Emotion, Logic, and Behavior (ELB) components, which were processed by LLMs to infer multiple distortion instances, each with a predicted type, expression, and model-assigned salience score. These instances were integrated via a Multi-View Gated Attention mechanism for final classification. Experiments on Korean (KoACD) and English (Therapist QA) datasets demonstrate that incorporating ELB and LLM-inferred salience scores improves classification performance, especially for distortions with high interpretive ambiguity. Our results suggested a psychologically grounded and generalizable approach for fine-grained reasoning in mental health NLP.</p></details> |  |
| **[Feedback Friction: LLMs Struggle to Fully Incorporate External Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11930v2)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have shown LLMs possess some ability to improve their responses when given external feedback. However, it remains unclear how effectively and thoroughly these models can incorporate extrinsic feedback. In an ideal scenario, if LLMs receive near-perfect and complete feedback, we would expect them to fully integrate the feedback and reach correct solutions. In this paper, we systematically investigate LLMs' ability to incorporate feedback by designing a controlled experimental environment. For each problem, a solver model attempts a solution, then a feedback generator with access to near-complete ground-truth answers produces targeted feedback, after which the solver tries again. We evaluate this pipeline across a diverse range of tasks, including math reasoning, knowledge reasoning, scientific reasoning, and general multi-domain evaluations with state-of-the-art language models including Claude 3.7 with extended thinking. Surprisingly, even under these near-ideal conditions, solver models consistently show resistance to feedback, a limitation that we term Feedback Friction. To mitigate this limitation, we experiment with sampling-based strategies like progressive temperature increases and explicit rejection of previously attempted incorrect answers, which yield improvements but still fail to help models achieve target performance. We analyze Feedback Friction and find that models' confidence on specific questions, measured by semantic entropy, predicts feedback resistance: high-confidence predictions remain resistant to external correction. We hope that highlighting this issue in LLMs will help future research in self-improvement.</p></details> |  |
| **[Why Are Web AI Agents More Vulnerable Than Standalone LLMs? A Security Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20383v3)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Web AI agents have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in addressing complex web navigation tasks. However, emerging research shows that these agents exhibit greater vulnerability compared to standalone Large Language Models (LLMs), despite both being built upon the same safety-aligned models. This discrepancy is particularly concerning given the greater flexibility of Web AI Agent compared to standalone LLMs, which may expose them to a wider range of adversarial user inputs. To build a scaffold that addresses these concerns, this study investigates the underlying factors that contribute to the increased vulnerability of Web AI agents. Notably, this disparity stems from the multifaceted differences between Web AI agents and standalone LLMs, as well as the complex signals - nuances that simple evaluation metrics, such as success rate, often fail to capture. To tackle these challenges, we propose a component-level analysis and a more granular, systematic evaluation framework. Through this fine-grained investigation, we identify three critical factors that amplify the vulnerability of Web AI agents; (1) embedding user goals into the system prompt, (2) multi-step action generation, and (3) observational capabilities. Our findings highlights the pressing need to enhance security and robustness in AI agent design and provide actionable insights for targeted defense strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: http://vulnerable-ai-agents.github.io</p></details> |

This greatly expands their abilities as various agents. However, LLMs rely entirely on the text descriptions of tools to decide which ones to use--a process that is surprisingly fragile. In this work, we expose a vulnerability in prevalent tool/function-calling protocols by investigating a series of edits to tool descriptions, some of which can drastically increase a tool's usage from LLMs when competing with alternatives. Through controlled experiments, we show that tools with properly edited descriptions receive over 10 times more usage from GPT-4.1 and Qwen2.5-7B than tools with original descriptions. We further evaluate how various edits to tool descriptions perform when competing directly with one another and how these trends generalize or differ across a broader set of 17 different models. These phenomena, while giving developers a powerful way to promote their tools, underscore the need for a more reliable foundation for agentic LLMs to select and utilize tools and resources.

Evaluating SLRs with LLM-based Multi-Agent System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17240v1)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Systematic Literature Reviews (SLRs) are foundational to evidence-based research but remain labor-intensive and prone to inconsistency across disciplines. We present an LLM-based SLR evaluation copilot built on a Multi-Agent System (MAS) architecture to assist researchers in assessing the overall quality of the systematic literature reviews. The system automates protocol validation, methodological assessment, and topic relevance checks using a scholarly database. Unlike conventional single-agent methods, our design integrates a specialized agentic approach aligned with PRISMA guidelines to support more structured and interpretable evaluations. We conducted an initial study on five published SLRs from diverse domains, comparing system outputs to expert-annotated PRISMA scores, and observed 84% agreement. While early results are promising, this work represents a first step toward scalable and accurate NLP-driven systems for interdisciplinary workflows and reveals their capacity for rigorous, domain-agnostic knowledge aggregation to streamline the review process.</p></details> |  |

Personalized emails especially are a popular touch point for marketers to inform users of latest items in stock, especially for those who stopped visiting the marketplace. Such emails contain personalized recommendations tailored to each user's interests, enticing users to buy relevant items. A common limitation of these emails is that the primary entry point, the title of the email, tends to follow fixed templates, failing to inspire enough interest in the contents. In this work, we explore the potential of large language models (LLMs) for generating thematic titles that reflect the personalized content of the emails.

Many countries are now building ``regional'' LLMs, but it remains unclear whether they reflect local values and practices or merely speak local languages. Using India as a case study, we evaluate six Indic and six global LLMs on two dimensions -- values and practices -- grounded in nationally representative surveys and community-sourced QA datasets. Across tasks, Indic models do not align better with Indian norms than global models; in fact, a U.S. respondent is a closer proxy for Indian values than any Indic model. Prompting and regional fine-tuning fail to recover alignment and can even degrade existing knowledge. We attribute this to scarce culturally grounded data, especially for pretraining. We position cultural evaluation as a first-class requirement alongside multilingual benchmarks and offer a reusable, community-grounded methodology. We call for native, community-authored corpora and thick x wide evaluations to build truly sovereign LLMs.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[SignalLLM: A General-Purpose LLM Agent Framework for Automated Signal Processing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17197v1)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern signal processing (SP) pipelines, whether model-based or data-driven, often constrained by complex and fragmented workflow, rely heavily on expert knowledge and manual engineering, and struggle with adaptability and generalization under limited data. In contrast, Large Language Models (LLMs) offer strong reasoning capabilities, broad general-purpose knowledge, in-context learning, and cross-modal transfer abilities, positioning them as powerful tools for automating and generalizing SP workflows. Motivated by these potentials, we introduce SignalLLM, the first general-purpose LLM-based agent framework for general SP tasks. Unlike prior LLM-based SP approaches that are limited to narrow applications or tricky prompting, SignalLLM introduces a principled, modular architecture. It decomposes high-level SP goals into structured subtasks via in-context learning and domain-specific retrieval, followed by hierarchical planning through adaptive retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and refinement; these subtasks are then executed through prompt-based reasoning, cross-modal reasoning, code synthesis, model invocation, or data-driven LLM-assisted modeling. Its generalizable design enables the flexible selection of problem solving strategies across different signal modalities, task types, and data conditions. We demonstrate the versatility and effectiveness of SignalLLM through five representative tasks in communication and sensing, such as radar target detection, human activity recognition, and text compression. Experimental results show superior performance over traditional and existing LLM-based methods, particularly in few-shot and zero-shot settings.</p></details> | 11 pages |

However, current interpretability methods often face challenges such as low resolution and high computational cost. To address these limitations, we propose the \textbf{Multi-Layer Attention Consistency Score (MACS)}, a novel, lightweight, and easily deployable heuristic for estimating the importance of input tokens in decoder-based models. MACS measures contributions of input tokens based on the consistency of maximal attention. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that MACS achieves a favorable trade-off between interpretability quality and computational efficiency, showing faithfulness comparable to complex techniques with a 22\% decrease in VRAM usage and 30\% reduction in latency.</p></details> |  |

However, manual thematic analysis is time-consuming and limits scalability. Recent advances in LLMs offer a pathway to automate thematic analysis, but alignment with human results remains limited. To address these limitations, we propose SFT-TA, an automated thematic analysis framework that embeds supervised fine-tuned (SFT) agents within a multi-agent system. Our framework outperforms existing frameworks and the gpt-4o baseline in alignment with human reference themes. We observed that SFT agents alone may underperform, but achieve better results than the baseline when embedded within a multi-agent system. Our results highlight that embedding SFT agents in specific roles within a multi-agent system is a promising pathway to improve alignment with desired outputs for thematic analysis.</p></details> |  |

Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) deliver strong reasoning capabilities but incur prohibitive computational costs, while lightweight edge models often fail on complex cases. In this paper, we present SAEC, a scene-aware enhanced edge-cloud collaborative industrial vision inspection framework with MLLM. The framework is composed of three synergistic components: (1) Efficient MLLM Fine-Tuning for Complex Defect Inspection, (2) Lightweight Multiscale Scene-Complexity Estimation, and (3) Adaptive Edge-Cloud Scheduler. Together, these modules enable robust defect detection by tailoring multimodal reasoning to scene complexity and dynamically balancing computation between edge and cloud resources. Experimental results on MVTec AD and KSDD2 datasets demonstrate that SAEC attains 85.11% and 82.72% accuracy, surpassing Qwen by 22.1% and 20.8%, and LLaVA by 33.3% and 31.6%.

To enhance prompt reuse and quality, Prompt-with-Me suggests language refinements, masks sensitive information, and extracts reusable templates from a developer's prompt library. Our taxonomy study of 1108 real-world prompts demonstrates that modern LLMs can accurately classify software engineering prompts. Furthermore, our user study with 11 participants shows strong developer acceptance, with high usability (Mean SUS=73), low cognitive load (Mean NASA-TLX=21), and reported gains in prompt quality and efficiency through reduced repetitive effort.

However, it remains unclear whether these synthetic conversations capture the nuanced emotional dynamics of real therapy. In this work, we introduce RealCBT, a dataset of authentic cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) dialogues, and conduct the first comparative analysis of emotional arcs between real and LLM-generated CBT sessions. We adapt the Utterance Emotion Dynamics framework to analyze fine-grained affective trajectories across valence, arousal, and dominance dimensions. Our analysis spans both full dialogues and individual speaker roles (counselor and client), using real sessions from the RealCBT dataset and synthetic dialogues from the CACTUS dataset. We find that while synthetic dialogues are fluent and structurally coherent, they diverge from real conversations in key emotional properties: real sessions exhibit greater emotional variability, more emotion-laden language, and more authentic patterns of reactivity and regulation. Moreover, emotional arc similarity remains low across all pairings, with especially weak alignment between real and synthetic speakers. These findings underscore the limitations of current LLM-generated therapy data and highlight the importance of emotional fidelity in mental health applications. To support future research, our dataset RealCBT is released at https://gitlab.com/xiaoyi.wang/realcbt-dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 2025 EMNLP findings,19 page,2 figures</p></details> |

While sparsity can reduce these costs, existing design space exploration (DSE) frameworks often overlook compression formats, a key factor for leveraging sparsity on accelerators. This paper proposes SnipSnap, a joint compression format and dataflow co-optimization framework for efficient sparse LLM accelerator design. SnipSnap introduces: (1) a hierarchical compression format encoding to expand the design space; (2) an adaptive compression engine for selecting formats under diverse sparsity; and (3) a progressive co-search workflow that jointly optimizes dataflow and compression formats. SnipSnap achieves 18.24\% average memory energy savings via format optimization, along with 2248.3$\times$ and 21.0$\times$ speedups over Sparseloop and DiMO-Sparse frameworks, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in the 31st Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference (ASP-DAC 2026)</p></details> |

Traditional models require intensive training, while LLMs offer flexible and generalizable zero-shot solutions but often generate generic or geographically irrelevant results due to missing trajectory and spatial context. To address these issues, we propose RALLM-POI, a framework that couples LLMs with retrieval-augmented generation and self-rectification. We first propose a Historical Trajectory Retriever (HTR) that retrieves relevant past trajectories to serve as contextual references, which are then reranked by a Geographical Distance Reranker (GDR) for prioritizing spatially relevant trajectories. Lastly, an Agentic LLM Rectifier (ALR) is designed to refine outputs through self-reflection. Without additional training, RALLM-POI achieves substantial accuracy gains across three real-world Foursquare datasets, outperforming both conventional and LLM-based baselines. Code is released at https://github.com/LKRcrocodile/RALLM-POI.</p></details> | PRICAI 2025 |

We introduce TactfulToM, a novel English benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' ability to understand white lies within real-life conversations and reason about prosocial motivations behind them, particularly when they are used to spare others' feelings and maintain social harmony. Our benchmark is generated through a multi-stage human-in-the-loop pipeline where LLMs expand manually designed seed stories into conversations to maintain the information asymmetry between participants necessary for authentic white lies. We show that TactfulToM is challenging for state-of-the-art models, which perform substantially below humans, revealing shortcomings in their ability to fully comprehend the ToM reasoning that enables true understanding of white lies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revisiting Backdoor Attacks on LLMs: A Stealthy and Practical Poisoning Framework via Harmless Inputs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17601v3)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have widely investigated backdoor attacks on Large language models (LLMs) by inserting harmful question-answer (QA) pairs into training data to implant triggers. However, we revisit existing attack methods and identify two critical limitations of that seriously undermine their stealthiness and practicality: (1) directly embedding harmful content into the training data compromise the model's safety alignment, resulting in high attack success rates even for clean queries without triggers, and (2) the poisoned training samples can be easily detected and filtered by safety-aligned guardrails (e.g., LLaMAGuard). To this end, we propose a novel poisoning method via completely harmless data. Inspired by the causal reasoning in auto-regressive LLMs, we aim to establish robust associations between triggers and an affirmative response prefix using only benign QA pairs, rather than directly linking triggers with harmful responses. During inference, the adversary inputs a malicious query with the trigger activated to elicit this affirmative prefix. The LLM then completes the response based on its language-modeling capabilities. Notably, achieving this behavior from clean QA pairs is non-trivial. We observe an interesting resistance phenomenon where the LLM initially appears to agree but subsequently refuses to answer. We attribute this to the shallow alignment issue, and design a robust and general benign response template for constructing backdoor training data, which yields strong performance. To further enhance attack efficacy, we improve the universal trigger via a gradient-based coordinate optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method effectively injects backdoors into various LLMs for harmful content generation, even under the detection of powerful guardrail models. E.g., ASRs of 86.67% and 85% on LLaMA-3-8B and Qwen-2.5-7B judged by GPT-4o.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Transfer Neurons Hypothesis: An Underlying Mechanism for Language Latent Space Transitions in Multilingual LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17030v1)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have suggested a processing framework for multilingual inputs in decoder-based LLMs: early layers convert inputs into English-centric and language-agnostic representations; middle layers perform reasoning within an English-centric latent space; and final layers generate outputs by transforming these representations back into language-specific latent spaces. However, the internal dynamics of such transformation and the underlying mechanism remain underexplored. Towards a deeper understanding of this framework, we propose and empirically validate The Transfer Neurons Hypothesis: certain neurons in the MLP module are responsible for transferring representations between language-specific latent spaces and a shared semantic latent space. Furthermore, we show that one function of language-specific neurons, as identified in recent studies, is to facilitate movement between latent spaces. Finally, we show that transfer neurons are critical for reasoning in multilingual LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>57 pa...</summary><p>57 pages, 47 figures and 41 tables; Accepted to EMNLP 2025 Main</p></details> |

However, precisely removing an object and its corresponding audio from a video without affecting the rest of the scene remains a significant challenge. To address this, we propose VAInpaint, a novel pipeline that first utilizes a segmentation model to generate masks and guide a video inpainting model in removing objects. At the same time, an LLM then analyzes the scene globally, while a region-specific model provides localized descriptions. Both the overall and regional descriptions will be inputted into an LLM, which will refine the content and turn it into text queries for our text-driven audio separation model. Our audio separation model is fine-tuned on a customized dataset comprising segmented MUSIC instrument images and VGGSound backgrounds to enhance its generalization performance. Experiments show that our method achieves performance comparable to current benchmarks in both audio and video inpainting.</p></details> |  |

However, due to data-sharing restrictions, sectors such as healthcare and finance prefer to deploy local LLM applications using costly hardware resources. This scenario requires a balance between the effectiveness advantages of LLMs and significant financial burdens. Additionally, the rapid evolution of models increases the frequency and redundancy of benchmarking efforts. Existing benchmarking toolkits, which typically focus on effectiveness, often overlook economic considerations, making their findings less applicable to practical scenarios. To address these challenges, we introduce CEBench, an open-source toolkit specifically designed for multi-objective benchmarking that focuses on the critical trade-offs between expenditure and effectiveness required for LLM deployments. CEBench allows for easy modifications through configuration files, enabling stakeholders to effectively assess and optimize these trade-offs. This strategic capability supports crucial decision-making processes aimed at maximizing effectiveness while minimizing cost impacts. By streamlining the evaluation process and emphasizing cost-effectiveness, CEBench seeks to facilitate the development of economically viable AI solutions across various industries and research fields.

Fine-tuning approaches proposed in the literature for LLMs on program repair tasks generally overlook the need to reason about the logic behind code changes, beyond syntactic patterns in the data. High-performing fine-tuning experiments also usually come at very high computational costs. With MORepair, we propose a novel perspective on the learning focus of LLM fine-tuning for program repair: we not only adapt the LLM parameters to the syntactic nuances of the task of code transformation (objective 1), but we also specifically fine-tune the LLM with respect to the logical reason behind the code change in the training data (objective 2). Such a multi-objective fine-tuning will instruct LLMs to generate high-quality patches. We apply MORepair to fine-tune four open-source LLMs with different sizes and architectures. Experimental results on function-level and repository-level repair benchmarks show that the implemented fine-tuning effectively boosts LLM repair performance by 11.4% to 56.0%. We further show that our fine-tuning strategy yields superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art approaches, including standard fine-tuning, Fine-tune-CoT, and RepairLLaMA.</p></details> |  |

Although existing Dense Pseudo-Label methods have demonstrated substantial potential in pseudo-labeling tasks, they remain constrained by selection ambiguities and inconsistencies in confidence estimation.In this paper, we introduce an LLM-assisted semantic guidance framework tailored for sparsely annotated remote sensing object detection, exploiting the advanced semantic reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to distill high-confidence pseudo-labels.By integrating LLM-generated semantic priors, we propose a Class-Aware Dense Pseudo-Label Assignment mechanism that adaptively assigns pseudo-labels for both unlabeled and sparsely labeled data, ensuring robust supervision across varying data distributions. Additionally, we develop an Adaptive Hard-Negative Reweighting Module to stabilize the supervised learning branch by mitigating the influence of confounding background information. Extensive experiments on DOTA and HRSC2016 demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing single-stage detector-based frameworks, significantly improving detection performance under sparse annotations.</p></details> |  |

Although prior studies have explored this issue using fixed-template or retrieval-based distractions, such static methods show limited effectiveness against contemporary models. To address this problem, we propose a dynamic distraction generation framework based on tree search, where the generation process is guided by model behavior. Without modifying the original question or answer, the method efficiently produces challenging adaptive distractions across multiple datasets, enabling systematic stress testing of LLMs' contextual robustness. Experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that the generated distractions lead to an average performance drop of over 45\% for mainstream models. Further comparisons of mitigation strategies show that prompt-based optimization methods yield limited gains, whereas post-training approaches (e.g., DPO) significantly enhance the model's contextual robustness. The results indicate that these issues do not stem from knowledge deficits in LLMs, but from a fundamental inability to maintain consistent reasoning under contextual distraction, posing a major challenge to the reliability of LLMs in real-world applications. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/wyf23187/Adaptive_Distractions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Elevating Visual Perception in Multimodal LLMs with Auxiliary Embedding Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09585v2)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent times, the standard practice for developing MLLMs is to feed features from vision encoder(s) into the LLM and train with natural language supervision. This approach often causes models to lean towards language comprehension and undermine the rich visual perception signals present in the data, which are critical for tasks involving spatial reasoning in the domain of embodied AI and robotics. Is it possible to optimize both at the same time? In this work, we propose VisPer-LM, the first approach that infuses visual perception knowledge from expert vision encoders into the LLM's (of an MLLM) hidden representations. We start by investigating MLLMs trained solely with natural language supervision and identify a positive correlation between the quality of visual representations within these models and their downstream performance. Given this insight, we formulate the objective during the pretraining stage in MLLMs as a coupled optimization of predictive visual embedding and next (text) token prediction. Moreover, through extensive probing, we observe improved visual representation quality due to embedding optimization, underscoring the effectiveness of our probing setup. We demonstrate that our VisPer-LM outperforms the single and multi-encoder baselines, proving our approach's superiority over explicitly feeding the corresponding features to the LLM. In particular, VisPer-LM boosts performance by an average margin of up to 2.5% on various benchmarks, with a notable improvement of 8.7% on the Depth task in CV-Bench.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://praeclarumjj3.github.io/visper_lm/</p></details> |

To solve this, we present SwarmChat, a context-aware, multimodal interaction system powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). SwarmChat enables users to issue natural language commands to robotic swarms using multiple modalities, such as text, voice, or teleoperation. The system integrates four LLM-based modules: Context Generator, Intent Recognition, Task Planner, and Modality Selector. These modules collaboratively generate context from keywords, detect user intent, adapt commands based on real-time robot state, and suggest optimal communication modalities. Its three-layer architecture offers a dynamic interface with both fixed and customizable command options, supporting flexible control while optimizing cognitive effort. The preliminary evaluation also shows that the SwarmChat's LLM modules provide accurate context interpretation, relevant intent recognition, and effective command delivery, achieving high user satisfaction.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted and presented at the 16th International Conference on Swarm Intelligence (ICSI 2025), held on July 11-15, 2025, in Yokohama, Japan</p></details> |

While previous evaluations have explored whether LLMs can infer intentions or detect deception, they often overlook the individualized reasoning styles that influence how people interpret and act in social contexts. Social deduction games (SDGs) provide a natural testbed for evaluating individualized reasoning styles, where different players may adopt diverse but contextually valid reasoning strategies under identical conditions. To address this, we introduce InMind, a cognitively grounded evaluation framework designed to assess whether LLMs can capture and apply personalized reasoning styles in SDGs. InMind enhances structured gameplay data with round-level strategy traces and post-game reflections, collected under both Observer and Participant modes. It supports four cognitively motivated tasks that jointly evaluate both static alignment and dynamic adaptation. As a case study, we apply InMind to the game Avalon, evaluating 11 state-of-the-art LLMs. General-purpose LLMs, even GPT-4o frequently rely on lexical cues, struggling to anchor reflections in temporal gameplay or adapt to evolving strategies. In contrast, reasoning-enhanced LLMs like DeepSeek-R1 exhibit early signs of style-sensitive reasoning. These findings reveal key limitations in current LLMs' capacity for individualized, adaptive reasoning, and position InMind as a step toward cognitively aligned human-AI interaction.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2025 MainConference</p></details> |

Such capabilities, however, are critical for applications like content-aware graphic layout design, which demands precise placement, alignment, and structural organization of multiple elements within constrained visual spaces. To address this gap, we propose LaySPA, a reinforcement learning-based framework that augments LLM agents with explicit spatial reasoning capabilities. LaySPA leverages hybrid reward signals that capture geometric validity, structural fidelity, and visual quality, enabling agents to model inter-element relationships, navigate the canvas, and optimize spatial arrangements. Through iterative self-exploration and adaptive policy optimization, LaySPA produces both interpretable reasoning traces and structured layouts. Experimental results demonstrate that LaySPA generates structurally sound and visually appealing layouts, outperforming larger general-purpose LLMs and achieving results on par with state-of-the-art specialized layout models.</p></details> |  |

Our evaluations on state-of-the-art LLMs reveal a universal failure pattern: accuracy collapses exponentially beyond a model-specific logical depth. Unlike existing benchmarks, seqBench's fine-grained control facilitates targeted analyses of these reasoning failures, illuminating universal scaling laws and statistical limits, as detailed in this paper alongside its generation methodology and evaluation metrics. We find that even top-performing models systematically fail on seqBench's structured reasoning tasks despite minimal search complexity, underscoring key limitations in their commonsense reasoning capabilities. Designed for future evolution to keep pace with advancing models, the seqBench datasets are publicly released to spur deeper scientific inquiry into LLM reasoning, aiming to establish a clearer understanding of their true potential and current boundaries for robust real-world application.</p></details> |  |

Unlike traditional rule-based systems with limited, predefined input-output spaces that inherently constrain unsafe behavior, LLMs enable open-ended, intelligent interactions--opening the door to jailbreak attacks through user inputs. Guardrails serve as a protective layer, filtering unsafe prompts before they reach the LLM. However, prior research shows that jailbreak attacks can still succeed over 70% of the time, even against advanced models like GPT-4o. While guardrails such as LlamaGuard report up to 95% accuracy, our preliminary analysis shows their performance can drop sharply--to as low as 12%--when confronted with unseen attacks. This highlights a growing software engineering challenge: how to build a post-deployment guardrail that adapts dynamically to emerging threats? To address this, we propose AdaptiveGuard, an adaptive guardrail that detects novel jailbreak attacks as out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs and learns to defend against them through a continual learning framework. Through empirical evaluation, AdaptiveGuard achieves 96% OOD detection accuracy, adapts to new attacks in just two update steps, and retains over 85% F1-score on in-distribution data post-adaptation, outperforming other baselines. These results demonstrate that AdaptiveGuard is a guardrail capable of evolving in response to emerging jailbreak strategies post deployment. We release our AdaptiveGuard and studied datasets at https://github.com/awsm-research/AdaptiveGuard to support further research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the ASE 2025 International Conference on Automated Software Engineering, Industry Showcase Track</p></details> |

Inspired by the dynamics of scientific committees and the "Society of Mind," we introduce Roundtable Policy, a complementary inference-time reasoning framework that performs inference through the weighted consensus of multiple LLMs. Our findings indicate that this approach significantly enhances reasoning in complex heterogeneous scientific tasks and improves scientific narratives in terms of creativity, rigor, and logical coherence, while reducing hallucinations that single models are prone to. Our approach emphasizes structured and interpretable consensus rather than opaque convergence, while requiring only black-box access and uniform procedures, making it broadly applicable to multi-LLM reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Equal...</summary><p>Equal contribution: Yu Yao and Jiayi Dong.

The next frontier is LLM personalization, where a foundation model can be fine-tuned with user/task-specific data. Given the sensitive nature of such private data, it is desirable to fine-tune these models on edge devices to improve user trust. However, fine-tuning on resource-constrained edge devices presents significant challenges due to substantial memory and computational demands, as well as limited infrastructure support. We observe that inference engines (e.g., ExecuTorch) can be repurposed for fine-tuning by leveraging zeroth-order (ZO) optimization, which uses multiple forward passes to approximate gradients. While promising, direct application of ZO methods on edge devices is inefficient due to the high computational cost of multiple forward passes required for accurate gradient estimation, and their deployment has been largely unexplored in practice. We introduce MobiZO, a resource-efficient fine-tuning framework for LLMs specifically designed for edge devices. MobiZO combines three key innovations: (1) a parallelized randomized gradient estimator that employs both outer-loop and inner-loop parallelism to eliminate sequential forward passes, (2) a specialized Multi-Perturbed LoRA (MP-LoRA) module that enables efficient realization of both inner and outer loop parallelism, and (3) a seamless integration with ExecuTorch for on-device training, requiring no modifications to the runtime. Experiments demonstrate that MobiZO achieves substantial runtime speedups and memory savings while improving fine-tuning accuracy, paving the way for practical deployment of LLMs in real-time, on-device applications.</p></details> |  |

Uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods are a promising tool for coping with this fundamental shortcoming. Yet, existing UQ methods face challenges such as high computational overhead or reliance on supervised learning. Here, we aim to bridge this gap. In particular, we propose RAUQ (Recurrent Attention-based Uncertainty Quantification), an unsupervised approach that leverages intrinsic attention patterns in transformers to detect hallucinations efficiently. By analyzing attention weights, we identified a peculiar pattern: drops in attention to preceding tokens are systematically observed during incorrect generations for certain "uncertainty-aware" heads. RAUQ automatically selects such heads, recurrently aggregates their attention weights and token-level confidences, and computes sequence-level uncertainty scores in a single forward pass. Experiments across 4 LLMs and 12 question answering, summarization, and translation tasks demonstrate that RAUQ yields excellent results, outperforming state-of-the-art UQ methods using minimal computational overhead (<1% latency). Moreover, it requires no task-specific labels and no careful hyperparameter tuning, offering plug-and-play real-time hallucination detection in white-box LLMs.</p></details> |  |

Recently, the discussion about appropriate and illuminating metaphors to describe LLMs has gained momentum. As an alternative to well-established metaphors such as "hallucinating" and "bullshit", we propose "kitsch" as a new metaphor. As an internationally widespread term from literary and cultural studies, we argue that "kitsch" is particularly suitable for analytically illuminating a previously neglected feature of LLM-based images and texts: their tendency to produce homogeneous and average content, which is becoming increasingly dominant as the proportion of AI-generated content on the internet grows. This is leading to the equalisation of language, style and argument. In view of the potential negative consequences of this averaging, including for human content producers on the internet, we advocate combining methods and insights from kitsch studies with AI research, philosophy, and communication studies in order to better understand the phenomenon and develop countermeasures.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages + 4 pages references</p></details> |

To address this, rule-based interactive agent simulations have been proposed to provide a structured training experience for new counsellors. However, these agents might suffer from limited language understanding and response variety. To overcome these limitations, we present a hybrid interactive agent that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) into a rule-based Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) framework, simulating more realistic virtual child chat conversations. This hybrid solution incorporates LLMs into three components: intent recognition, response generation, and a bypass mechanism. We evaluated the system through two studies: a script-based assessment comparing LLM-generated responses to human-crafted responses, and a within-subject experiment (N=37) comparing the LLM-integrated agent with a rule-based version. The first study provided evidence that the three LLM components were non-inferior to human-crafted responses. In the second study, we found credible support for two hypotheses: participants perceived the LLM-integrated agent as more believable and reported more positive attitudes toward it than the rule-based agent. Additionally, although weaker, there was some support for increased engagement (posterior probability = 0.845, 95% HDI [-0.149, 0.465]). Our findings demonstrate the potential of integrating LLMs into rule-based systems, offering a promising direction for more flexible but controlled training systems.</p></details> |  |

However, data contamination-unintentional memorization of benchmark data during model training-poses critical challenges for fair evaluation. Existing detection methods for unimodal large language models (LLMs) are inadequate for MLLMs due to multimodal data complexity and multi-phase training. We systematically analyze multimodal data contamination using our analytical framework, MM-Detect, which defines two contamination categories-unimodal and cross-modal-and effectively quantifies contamination severity across multiple-choice and caption-based Visual Question Answering tasks. Evaluations on twelve MLLMs and five benchmarks reveal significant contamination, particularly in proprietary models and older benchmarks. Crucially, contamination sometimes originates during unimodal pre-training rather than solely from multimodal fine-tuning. Our insights refine contamination understanding, guiding evaluation practices and improving multimodal model reliability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2025 Findings</p></details> |

We define LLM dark patterns as manipulative or deceptive behaviors enacted in dialogue. Drawing on prior work and AI incident reports, we outline a diverse set of categories with real-world examples. Using them, we conducted a scenario-based study where participants (N=34) compared manipulative and neutral LLM responses. Our results reveal that recognition of LLM dark patterns often hinged on conversational cues such as exaggerated agreement, biased framing, or privacy intrusions, but these behaviors were also sometimes normalized as ordinary assistance. Users' perceptions of these dark patterns shaped how they respond to them. Responsibilities for these behaviors were also attributed in different ways, with participants assigning it to companies and developers, the model itself, or to users. We conclude with implications for design, advocacy, and governance to safeguard user autonomy.</p></details> |  |

This study introduces KoACD, the first large-scale dataset of cognitive distortions in Korean adolescents, containing 108,717 instances. We applied a multi-Large Language Model (LLM) negotiation method to refine distortion classification, enabling iterative feedback and role-switching between models to reduce bias and improve label consistency. In addition, we generated synthetic data using two approaches: cognitive clarification for textual clarity and cognitive balancing for diverse distortion representation. Validation through LLMs and expert evaluations showed that while LLMs classified distortions with explicit markers, they struggled with context-dependent reasoning, where human evaluators demonstrated higher accuracy. KoACD aims to enhance future research on cognitive distortion detection. The dataset and implementation details are publicly accessible.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Findings of EMNLP 2025</p></details> |

In contrast, many real-world settings are asynchronous. For example, in group chats, online team meetings, or social games, there is no inherent notion of turns. In this work, we develop an adaptive asynchronous LLM agent consisting of two modules: a generator that decides what to say, and a scheduler that decides when to say it. To evaluate our agent, we collect a unique dataset of online Mafia games, where our agent plays with human participants. Overall, our agent performs on par with human players, both in game performance metrics and in its ability to blend in with the other human players. Our analysis shows that the agent's behavior in deciding when to speak closely mirrors human patterns, although differences emerge in message content. We make all of our code and data publicly available. This work paves the way for integration of LLMs into realistic human group settings, from assistance in team discussions to educational and professional environments where complex social dynamics must be navigated.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Transparent and Incentive-Compatible Collaboration in Decentralized LLM Multi-Agent Systems: A Blockchain-Driven Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16736v1)** | 2025-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled the emergence of autonomous agents capable of complex reasoning, planning, and interaction. However, coordinating such agents at scale remains a fundamental challenge, particularly in decentralized environments where communication lacks transparency and agent behavior cannot be shaped through centralized incentives. We propose a blockchain-based framework that enables transparent agent registration, verifiable task allocation, and dynamic reputation tracking through smart contracts. The core of our design lies in two mechanisms: a matching score-based task allocation protocol that evaluates agents by reputation, capability match, and workload; and a behavior-shaping incentive mechanism that adjusts agent behavior via feedback on performance and reward. Our implementation integrates GPT-4 agents with Solidity contracts and demonstrates, through 50-round simulations, strong task success rates, stable utility distribution, and emergent agent specialization. The results underscore the potential for trustworthy, incentive-compatible multi-agent coordination in open environments.</p></details> | 17 pages, 7 figures |

We introduce PAPERS, an output-based evaluation of the values LLMs prioritise in their text. Study 1 thematically analysed responses from eleven LLMs, identifying five recurring dimensions (Purposeful Contribution, Adaptive Growth, Positive Relationality, Ethical Integrity, and Robust Functionality) with Self-Actualised Autonomy appearing only under a hypothetical sentience prompt. These results suggest that LLMs are trained to prioritise humanistic and utility values as dual objectives of optimal functioning, a pattern supported by existing AI alignment and prioritisation frameworks. Study 2 operationalised PAPERS as a ranking instrument across the same eleven LLMs, yielding stable, non-random value priorities alongside systematic between-model differences. Hierarchical clustering distinguished "human-centric" models (e.g., ChatGPT-4o, Claude Sonnet 4) that prioritised relational/ethical values from "utility-driven" models (e.g., Llama 4, Gemini 2.5 Pro) that emphasised operational priorities. Study 3 benchmarked four LLMs against human judgements (N = 376) under matched prompts, finding near-perfect rank-order convergence (r = .97-.98) but moderate absolute agreement; among tested models, ChatGPT-4o showed the closest alignment with human ratings (ICC = .78). Humans also showed limited readiness to endorse sentient AI systems. Taken together, PAPERS enabled systematic value audits and revealed trade-offs with direct implications for deployment: human-centric models aligned more closely with human value judgments and appear better suited for humanistic psychological applications, whereas utility-driven models emphasised functional efficiency and may be more appropriate for instrumental or back-office tasks.</p></details> |  |

Despite the fact that this emerging area holds significant promise, it remains largely underexplored due to the lack of a well-designed playground to develop a complete drama. This makes a significant barrier for researchers to replicate, extend, and study such systems. Hence, we present Open-Theatre, the first open-source toolkit for experiencing and customizing LLM-based interactive drama. It refines prior work with an efficient multi-agent architecture and a hierarchical retrieval-based memory system, designed to enhance narrative coherence and realistic long-term behavior in complex interactions. In addition, we provide a highly configurable pipeline, making it easy for researchers to develop and optimize new approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP 2025 demo</p></details> |

Our middle-ground view is that LLMs extrapolate from priors from their training data while using context to guide the model to the appropriate priors; we call this "context-directed extrapolation." Specifically, this context direction is achieved through examples in base models, leading to in-context learning, while instruction tuning allows LLMs to perform similarly based on prompts rather than explicit examples. Under this view, substantiated though existing literature, while reasoning capabilities go well beyond stochastic parroting, such capabilities are predictable, controllable, not indicative of advanced reasoning akin to high-level cognitive capabilities in humans, and not infinitely scalable with additional training. As a result, fears of uncontrollable emergence of agency are allayed, while research advances are appropriately refocused on the processes of context-directed extrapolation and how this interacts with training data to produce valuable capabilities in LLMs. Future work can therefore explore alternative augmenting techniques that do not rely on inherent advanced reasoning in LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[No Need for Explanations: LLMs can implicitly learn from mistakes in-context](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08550v3)** | 2025-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Showing incorrect answers to Large Language Models (LLMs) is a popular strategy to improve their performance in reasoning-intensive tasks. It is widely assumed that, in order to be helpful, the incorrect answers must be accompanied by comprehensive rationales, explicitly detailing where the mistakes are and how to correct them. However, in this work we present a counterintuitive finding: we observe that LLMs perform better in math reasoning tasks when these rationales are eliminated from the context and models are left to infer on their own what makes an incorrect answer flawed. This approach also substantially outperforms chain-of-thought prompting in our evaluations. These results are consistent across LLMs of different sizes and varying reasoning abilities. To gain an understanding of why LLMs learn from mistakes more effectively without explicit corrective rationales, we perform a thorough analysis, investigating changes in context length and answer diversity between different prompting strategies, and their effect on performance. We also examine evidence of overfitting to the in-context rationales when these are provided, and study the extent to which LLMs are able to autonomously infer high-quality corrective rationales given only incorrect answers as input. We find evidence that, while incorrect answers are more beneficial for LLM learning than additional diverse correct answers, explicit corrective rationales over-constrain the model, thus limiting those benefits.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 |

This challenge arises in typical scenarios such as replacing obsolete hardware and adapting configurations to emerging paradigms like Software Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV). Engineers need to thoroughly understand both source and target configuration models, which requires considerable effort due to the complexity and evolving nature of these specifications. To promote automation in network configuration translation, we propose INTA, an intent-based translation framework that leverages Large Language Model (LLM) agents. The key idea of INTA is to use configuration intent as an intermediate representation for translation. It first employs LLMs to decompose configuration files and extract fine-grained intents for each configuration fragment. These intents are then used to retrieve relevant manuals of the target device. Guided by a syntax checker, INTA incrementally generates target configurations. The translated configurations are further verified and refined for semantic consistency. We implement INTA and evaluate it on real-world configuration datasets from the industry. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in translation accuracy and exhibits strong generalizability. INTA achieves an accuracy of 98.15% in terms of both syntactic and view correctness, and a command recall rate of 84.72% for the target configuration. The semantic consistency report of the translated configuration further demonstrates its practical value in real-world network operations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by The 33rd IEEE International Conference on Network Protocols (IEEE ICNP 2025)</p></details> |

While Multi-Head Attention (MHA) offers strong representational power, it incurs significant memory overhead. Recent work on Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) mitigates this by compressing KV representations into a shared latent space, achieving a better trade-off between performance and cache efficiency. While MLA already achieves significant KV cache reduction, the scope for further compression remains limited without performance loss. In this paper, we propose \textbf{Embedding-Gated Multi-head Latent Attention (EG-MLA)}, a novel extension of MLA that further reduces KV cache size while enhancing representational expressiveness. EG-MLA introduces a token-specific embedding gating mechanism applied in the latent space, enabling fine-grained modulation of compressed KV vectors with minimal additional computation. Compared to MHA, EG-MLA achieves over 91.6\% reduction in KV cache size with negligible performance degradation. Relative to MLA, EG-MLA consistently improves task accuracy across diverse reasoning benchmarks while achieving up to 59.9\% additional memory savings. Our theoretical analysis highlights how embedding gating induces implicit high-order interactions, and empirical evaluations demonstrate robust generalization across model scales and compression regimes. Notably, we successfully scale EG-MLA to over 1 billion parameters, demonstrating its practical viability for large-scale LLM deployment. These results establish EG-MLA as a memory- and compute-efficient attention mechanism that enables scalable, high-performance inference in modern LLMs.</p></details> |  |

This scenario demands the implementation of advanced security measures, not only to mitigate damage but also to anticipate emerging attack trends. In this context, deception tools have become a key strategy, enabling the detection, deterrence, and deception of potential attackers while facilitating the collection of information about their tactics and methods. Among these tools, honeypots have proven their value, although they have traditionally been limited by rigidity and configuration complexity, hindering their adaptability to dynamic scenarios. The rise of artificial intelligence, and particularly general-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs), is driving the development of new deception solutions capable of offering greater adaptability and ease of use. This work proposes the design and implementation of an LLM-based honeypot to simulate an LDAP server, a critical protocol present in most organizations due to its central role in identity and access management. The proposed solution aims to provide a flexible and realistic tool capable of convincingly interacting with attackers, thereby contributing to early detection and threat analysis while enhancing the defensive capabilities of infrastructures against intrusions targeting this service.</p></details> |  |

Although existing surveys offer overviews of RL augmented LLMs, their scope is often limited, failing to provide a comprehensive summary of how RL operates across the full lifecycle of LLMs. We systematically review the theoretical and practical advancements whereby RL empowers LLMs, especially Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). First, we briefly introduce the basic theory of RL. Second, we thoroughly detail application strategies for RL across various phases of the LLM lifecycle, including pre-training, alignment fine-tuning, and reinforced reasoning. In particular, we emphasize that RL methods in the reinforced reasoning phase serve as a pivotal driving force for advancing model reasoning to its limits. Next, we collate existing datasets and evaluation benchmarks currently used for RL fine-tuning, spanning human-annotated datasets, AI-assisted preference data, and program-verification-style corpora. Subsequently, we review the mainstream open-source tools and training frameworks available, providing clear practical references for subsequent research. Finally, we analyse the future challenges and trends in the field of RL-enhanced LLMs. This survey aims to present researchers and practitioners with the latest developments and frontier trends at the intersection of RL and LLMs, with the goal of fostering the evolution of LLMs that are more intelligent, generalizable, and secure.</p></details> | <details><summary>A Sur...</summary><p>A Survey of Reinforcement Learning for Large Language Models</p></details> |

However, their reliability under adversarial compiler-level obfuscation is yet to be discovered. In this study, we empirically evaluate the robustness of three state-of-the-art LLMs: ChatGPT-4o, Gemini Flash 2.5, and Claude Sonnet 4 against compiler-level obfuscation techniques implemented via the LLVM infrastructure. These include control flow flattening, bogus control flow injection, instruction substitution, and split basic blocks, which are widely used to evade detection while preserving malicious behavior. We perform a structured evaluation on 40~C functions (20 vulnerable, 20 secure) sourced from the Devign dataset and obfuscated using LLVM passes. Our results show that these models often fail to correctly classify obfuscated code, with precision, recall, and F1-score dropping significantly after transformation. This reveals a critical limitation: LLMs, despite their language understanding capabilities, can be easily misled by compiler-based obfuscation strategies. To promote reproducibility, we release all evaluation scripts, prompts, and obfuscated code samples in a public repository. We also discuss the implications of these findings for adversarial threat modeling, and outline future directions such as software watermarking, compiler-aware defenses, and obfuscation-resilient model design.</p></details> |  |

However, the key properties of language shaping brain-like representations, and their evolution during training as a function of different tasks remain unclear. We here benchmark 34 training checkpoints spanning 300B tokens across 8 different model sizes to analyze how brain alignment relates to linguistic competence. Specifically, we find that brain alignment tracks the development of formal linguistic competence -- i.e., knowledge of linguistic rules -- more closely than functional linguistic competence. While functional competence, which involves world knowledge and reasoning, continues to develop throughout training, its relationship with brain alignment is weaker, suggesting that the human language network primarily encodes formal linguistic structure rather than broader cognitive functions. We further show that model size is not a reliable predictor of brain alignment when controlling for feature size and find that the correlation between next-word prediction, behavioral alignment and brain alignment fades once models surpass human language proficiency. Finally, using the largest set of rigorous neural language benchmarks to date, we show that language brain alignment benchmarks remain unsaturated, highlighting opportunities for improving future models. Taken together, our findings suggest that the human language network is best modeled by formal, rather than functional, aspects of language.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2025.

In this paper, we propose LIR-ASR, a heuristic optimized iterative correction framework using LLMs, inspired by human auditory perception. LIR-ASR applies a "Listening-Imagining-Refining" strategy, generating phonetic variants and refining them in context. A heuristic optimization with finite state machine (FSM) is introduced to prevent the correction process from being trapped in local optima and rule-based constraints help maintain semantic fidelity. Experiments on both English and Chinese ASR outputs show that LIR-ASR achieves average reductions in CER/WER of up to 1.5 percentage points compared to baselines, demonstrating substantial accuracy gains in transcription.</p></details> |  |

Previous work focuses on leveraging a user's own history, overlooking inter-user differences that are crucial for effective personalization. While recent work has attempted to model such differences, the reliance on language-based prompts often hampers the effective extraction of meaningful distinctions. To address these issues, we propose Difference-aware Embedding-based Personalization (DEP), a framework that models inter-user differences in the latent space instead of relying on language prompts. DEP constructs soft prompts by contrasting a user's embedding with those of peers who engaged with similar content, highlighting relative behavioral signals. A sparse autoencoder then filters and compresses both user-specific and difference-aware embeddings, preserving only task-relevant features before injecting them into a frozen LLM. Experiments on personalized review generation show that DEP consistently outperforms baseline methods across multiple metrics.

We propose Functionally Equivalent Sampling for Trust Assessment (FESTA), a multimodal input sampling technique for MLLMs, that generates an uncertainty measure based on the equivalent and complementary input samplings. The proposed task-preserving sampling approach for uncertainty quantification expands the input space to probe the consistency (through equivalent samples) and sensitivity (through complementary samples) of the model. FESTA uses only input-output access of the model (black-box), and does not require ground truth (unsupervised). The experiments are conducted with various off-the-shelf multi-modal LLMs, on both visual and audio reasoning tasks. The proposed FESTA uncertainty estimate achieves significant improvement (33.3% relative improvement for vision-LLMs and 29.6% relative improvement for audio-LLMs) in selective prediction performance, based on area-under-receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUROC) metric in detecting mispredictions.

Currently, jailbreak attacks based on prompt engineering have become a major safety threat. However, existing methods primarily rely on black-box manipulation of prompt templates, resulting in poor interpretability and limited generalization. To break through the bottleneck, this study first introduces the concept of Defense Threshold Decay (DTD), revealing the potential safety impact caused by LLMs' benign generation: as benign content generation in LLMs increases, the model's focus on input instructions progressively diminishes. Building on this insight, we propose the Sugar-Coated Poison (SCP) attack paradigm, which uses a "semantic reversal" strategy to craft benign inputs that are opposite in meaning to malicious intent. This strategy induces the models to generate extensive benign content, thereby enabling adversarial reasoning to bypass safety mechanisms. Experiments show that SCP outperforms existing baselines. Remarkably, it achieves an average attack success rate of 87.23% across six LLMs. For defense, we propose Part-of-Speech Defense (POSD), leveraging verb-noun dependencies for syntactic analysis to enhance safety of LLMs while preserving their generalization ability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP2025</p></details> |

In this work, we present an empirical study on using the diffusion-based large language model LLaDA for automatic speech recognition (ASR). We first investigate its use as an external deliberation-based processing module for Whisper-LLaMA transcripts. By leveraging the bidirectional attention and denoising capabilities of LLaDA, we explore random masking, low-confidence masking, and semi-autoregressive strategies, showing that Whisper-LLaDA substantially reduces WER compared with the baseline. On LibriSpeech, the best cascade system achieves 2.25%/4.94% WER on test-clean/test-other, representing a 12.3% relative improvement over the Whisper-LLaMA baseline on the test-other split. In contrast, a plain-text LLaDA without acoustic features fails to improve accuracy, highlighting the importance of audio-conditioned embeddings. We further evaluate Whisper-LLaDA as a standalone decoder for ASR with diffusion-based and semi-autoregressive decoding. Most experimental configurations achieve faster inference than the Whisper-LLaMA baseline, although recognition accuracy is slightly lower. These findings offer an empirical view of diffusion-based LLMs for ASR and point to promising directions for improvements.</p></details> |  |

These issues often stem from an incomplete understanding of user goals and inadequate comprehension of tool documentation. While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has proven effective for enhancing reasoning in general contexts, our analysis reveals that free-form CoT is insufficient and sometimes counterproductive for structured function-calling tasks. To address this, we introduce a curriculum-inspired framework that leverages structured reasoning templates to guide LLMs through more deliberate step-by-step instructions for generating function callings. Experimental results show that our method reduces tool-use errors, achieving 3-12% relative improvements over strong baselines across diverse model series and approaches. Moreover, our framework enhances the robustness, interpretability, and transparency of tool-using agents, advancing the development of more reliable AI assistants for real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2025 Main Conference</p></details> |

Issue localization forms the basis for accurate issue solving. Recently, LLM-based issue localization methods have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance. However, these methods either search from files mentioned in issue descriptions or in the whole repository and struggle to balance the breadth and depth of the search space to converge on the target efficiently. Moreover, they allow LLM to explore whole repositories freely, making it challenging to control the search direction to prevent the LLM from searching for incorrect targets. This paper introduces CoSIL, an LLM-driven, powerful function-level issue localization method without training or indexing. CoSIL employs a two-phase code graph search strategy. It first conducts broad exploration at the file level using dynamically constructed module call graphs, and then performs in-depth analysis at the function level by expanding the module call graph into a function call graph and executing iterative searches. To precisely control the search direction, CoSIL designs a pruner to filter unrelated directions and irrelevant contexts. To avoid incorrect interaction formats in long contexts, CoSIL introduces a reflection mechanism that uses additional independent queries in short contexts to enhance formatted abilities. Experiment results demonstrate that CoSIL achieves a Top-1 localization accuracy of 43.3\% and 44.6\% on SWE-bench Lite and SWE-bench Verified, respectively, with Qwen2.5-Coder-32B, average outperforming the state-of-the-art methods by 96.04\%. When CoSIL is integrated into an issue-solving method, Agentless, the issue resolution rate improves by 2.98\%--30.5\%.</p></details> | Accepted by ASE 2025 |

This greatly expands their abilities as various agents. However, LLMs rely entirely on the text descriptions of tools to decide which ones to use--a process that is surprisingly fragile. In this work, we expose a vulnerability in prevalent tool/function-calling protocols by investigating a series of edits to tool descriptions, some of which can drastically increase a tool's usage from LLMs when competing with alternatives. Through controlled experiments, we show that tools with properly edited descriptions receive over 10 times more usage from GPT-4.1 and Qwen2.5-7B than tools with original descriptions. We further evaluate how various edits to tool descriptions perform when competing directly with one another and how these trends generalize or differ across a broader set of 17 different models. These phenomena, while giving developers a powerful way to promote their tools, underscore the need for a more reliable foundation for agentic LLMs to select and utilize tools and resources.

These models are usually developed by optimization experts but are used by practitioners without optimization expertise in various application domains. As a result, practitioners often struggle to interact with and draw useful conclusions from optimization models independently. To fill this gap, we introduce OptiChat, a natural language dialogue system designed to help practitioners interpret model formulation, diagnose infeasibility, analyze sensitivity, retrieve information, evaluate modifications, and provide counterfactual explanations. By augmenting large language models (LLMs) with functional calls and code generation tailored for optimization models, we enable seamless interaction and minimize the risk of hallucinations in OptiChat. We develop a new dataset to evaluate OptiChat's performance in explaining optimization models. Experiments demonstrate that OptiChat effectively bridges the gap between optimization models and practitioners, delivering autonomous, accurate, and instant responses.</p></details> |  |

In real-world scenarios, user questions often require retrieving answers that are distributed across multiple tables. GraphRAG has recently attracted much attention for enhancing LLMs' reasoning capabilities by organizing external knowledge to address ad-hoc and complex questions, exemplifying a promising direction for cross-table question answering. In this paper, to address the current gap in available data, we first introduce a multi-table benchmark, MutliTableQA, comprising 60k tables and 25k user queries collected from real-world sources. Then, we propose the first Graph-Table-RAG framework, namely GTR, which reorganizes table corpora into a heterogeneous graph, employs a hierarchical coarse-to-fine retrieval process to extract the most relevant tables, and integrates graph-aware prompting for downstream LLMs' tabular reasoning. Extensive experiments show that GTR exhibits superior cross-table question-answering performance while maintaining high deployment efficiency, demonstrating its real-world practical applicability.</p></details> | 20 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Small Models are LLM Knowledge Triggers on Medical Tabular Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01570v3)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent development in large language models (LLMs) has demonstrated impressive domain proficiency on unstructured textual or multi-modal tasks. However, despite with intrinsic world knowledge, their application on structured tabular data prediction still lags behind, primarily due to the numerical insensitivity and modality discrepancy that brings a gap between LLM reasoning and statistical tabular learning. Unlike textual or vision data (e.g., electronic clinical notes or medical imaging data), tabular data is often presented in heterogeneous numerical values (e.g., CBC reports). This ubiquitous data format requires intensive expert annotation, and its numerical nature limits LLMs' capability to effectively transfer untapped domain expertise. In this paper, we propose SERSAL, a general self-prompting method by synergy learning with small models to enhance LLM tabular prediction in an unsupervised manner. Specifically, SERSAL utilizes the LLM's prior outcomes as original soft noisy annotations, which are dynamically leveraged to teach a better small student model. Reversely, the outcomes from the trained small model are used to teach the LLM to further refine its real capability. This process can be repeatedly applied to gradually distill refined knowledge for continuous progress. Comprehensive experiments on widely used medical domain tabular datasets show that, without access to gold labels, applying SERSAL to OpenAI GPT reasoning process attains substantial improvement compared to linguistic prompting methods, which serves as an orthogonal direction for tabular LLM, and increasing prompting bonus is observed as more powerful LLMs appear.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025.

| **[Elephants Never Forget: Memorization and Learning of Tabular Data in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06209v3)** | 2024-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While many have shown how Large Language Models (LLMs) can be applied to a diverse set of tasks, the critical issues of data contamination and memorization are often glossed over. In this work, we address this concern for tabular data. Specifically, we introduce a variety of different techniques to assess whether a language model has seen a tabular dataset during training. This investigation reveals that LLMs have memorized many popular tabular datasets verbatim. We then compare the few-shot learning performance of LLMs on datasets that were seen during training to the performance on datasets released after training. We find that LLMs perform better on datasets seen during training, indicating that memorization leads to overfitting. At the same time, LLMs show non-trivial performance on novel datasets and are surprisingly robust to data transformations. We then investigate the in-context statistical learning abilities of LLMs. While LLMs are significantly better than random at solving statistical classification problems, the sample efficiency of few-shot learning lags behind traditional statistical learning algorithms, especially as the dimension of the problem increases. This suggests that much of the observed few-shot performance on novel real-world datasets is due to the LLM's world knowledge. Overall, our results highlight the importance of testing whether an LLM has seen an evaluation dataset during pre-training. We release the https://github.com/interpretml/LLM-Tabular-Memorization-Checker Python package to test LLMs for memorization of tabular datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>COLM ...</summary><p>COLM camera ready, fix typo</p></details> |
| **[LLM Embeddings Improve Test-time Adaptation to Tabular $Y|X$-Shifts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07395v1)** | 2024-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For tabular datasets, the change in the relationship between the label and covariates ($Y|X$-shifts) is common due to missing variables (a.k.a. confounders). Since it is impossible to generalize to a completely new and unknown domain, we study models that are easy to adapt to the target domain even with few labeled examples. We focus on building more informative representations of tabular data that can mitigate $Y|X$-shifts, and propose to leverage the prior world knowledge in LLMs by serializing (write down) the tabular data to encode it. We find LLM embeddings alone provide inconsistent improvements in robustness, but models trained on them can be well adapted/finetuned to the target domain even using 32 labeled observations. Our finding is based on a comprehensive and systematic study consisting of 7650 source-target pairs and benchmark against 261,000 model configurations trained by 22 algorithms. Our observation holds when ablating the size of accessible target data and different adaptation strategies. The code is available at https://github.com/namkoong-lab/LLM-Tabular-Shifts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Elephants Never Forget: Testing Language Models for Memorization of Tabular Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06644v1)** | 2024-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While many have shown how Large Language Models (LLMs) can be applied to a diverse set of tasks, the critical issues of data contamination and memorization are often glossed over. In this work, we address this concern for tabular data. Starting with simple qualitative tests for whether an LLM knows the names and values of features, we introduce a variety of different techniques to assess the degrees of contamination, including statistical tests for conditional distribution modeling and four tests that identify memorization. Our investigation reveals that LLMs are pre-trained on many popular tabular datasets. This exposure can lead to invalid performance evaluation on downstream tasks because the LLMs have, in effect, been fit to the test set. Interestingly, we also identify a regime where the language model reproduces important statistics of the data, but fails to reproduce the dataset verbatim. On these datasets, although seen during training, good performance on downstream tasks might not be due to overfitting. Our findings underscore the need for ensuring data integrity in machine learning tasks with LLMs. To facilitate future research, we release an open-source tool that can perform various tests for memorization \url{https://github.com/interpretml/LLM-Tabular-Memorization-Checker}.</p></details> | <details><summary>Table...</summary><p>Table Representation Learning Workshop at NeurIPS 2023</p></details> |
