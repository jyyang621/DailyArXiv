| **[Retrieving Semantics from the Deep: an RAG Solution for Gesture Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06786v2)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Non-verbal communication often comprises of semantically rich gestures that help convey the meaning of an utterance. Producing such semantic co-speech gestures has been a major challenge for the existing neural systems that can generate rhythmic beat gestures, but struggle to produce semantically meaningful gestures. Therefore, we present RAG-Gesture, a diffusion-based gesture generation approach that leverages Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to produce natural-looking and semantically rich gestures. Our neuro-explicit gesture generation approach is designed to produce semantic gestures grounded in interpretable linguistic knowledge. We achieve this by using explicit domain knowledge to retrieve exemplar motions from a database of co-speech gestures. Once retrieved, we then inject these semantic exemplar gestures into our diffusion-based gesture generation pipeline using DDIM inversion and retrieval guidance at the inference time without any need of training. Further, we propose a control paradigm for guidance, that allows the users to modulate the amount of influence each retrieval insertion has over the generated sequence. Our comparative evaluations demonstrate the validity of our approach against recent gesture generation approaches. The reader is urged to explore the results on our project page.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

| **[GTR: Graph-Table-RAG for Cross-Table Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01346v2)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Beyond pure text, a substantial amount of knowledge is stored in tables. In real-world scenarios, user questions often require retrieving answers that are distributed across multiple tables. GraphRAG has recently attracted much attention for enhancing LLMs' reasoning capabilities by organizing external knowledge to address ad-hoc and complex questions, exemplifying a promising direction for cross-table question answering. In this paper, to address the current gap in available data, we first introduce a multi-table benchmark, MutliTableQA, comprising 60k tables and 25k user queries collected from real-world sources. Then, we propose the first Graph-Table-RAG framework, namely GTR, which reorganizes table corpora into a heterogeneous graph, employs a hierarchical coarse-to-fine retrieval process to extract the most relevant tables, and integrates graph-aware prompting for downstream LLMs' tabular reasoning. Extensive experiments show that GTR exhibits superior cross-table question-answering performance while maintaining high deployment efficiency, demonstrating its real-world practical applicability.</p></details> | 20 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Real-Time Evaluation Models for RAG: Who Detects Hallucinations Best?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21157v2)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This article surveys Evaluation models to automatically detect hallucinations in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and presents a comprehensive benchmark of their performance across six RAG applications. Methods included in our study include: LLM-as-a-Judge, Prometheus, Lynx, the Hughes Hallucination Evaluation Model (HHEM), and the Trustworthy Language Model (TLM). These approaches are all reference-free, requiring no ground-truth answers/labels to catch incorrect LLM responses. Our study reveals that, across diverse RAG applications, some of these approaches consistently detect incorrect RAG responses with high precision/recall.</p></details> | 11 pages, 8 figures |
| **[From Code Generation to Software Testing: AI Copilot with Context-Based RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01866v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid pace of large-scale software development places increasing demands on traditional testing methodologies, often leading to bottlenecks in efficiency, accuracy, and coverage. We propose a novel perspective on software testing by positing bug detection and coding with fewer bugs as two interconnected problems that share a common goal, which is reducing bugs with limited resources. We extend our previous work on AI-assisted programming, which supports code auto-completion and chatbot-powered Q&A, to the realm of software testing. We introduce Copilot for Testing, an automated testing system that synchronizes bug detection with codebase updates, leveraging context-based Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to enhance the capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Our evaluation demonstrates a 31.2% improvement in bug detection accuracy, a 12.6% increase in critical test coverage, and a 10.5% higher user acceptance rate, highlighting the transformative potential of AI-driven technologies in modern software development practices.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted for publication in IEEE Software (DOI: 10.1109/MS.2025.3549628)</p></details> |
| **[Beyond Quacking: Deep Integration of Language Models and RAG into DuckDB](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01157v1)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge-intensive analytical applications retrieve context from both structured tabular data and unstructured, text-free documents for effective decision-making. Large language models (LLMs) have made it significantly easier to prototype such retrieval and reasoning data pipelines. However, implementing these pipelines efficiently still demands significant effort and has several challenges. This often involves orchestrating heterogeneous data systems, managing data movement, and handling low-level implementation details, e.g., LLM context management. To address these challenges, we introduce FlockMTL: an extension for DBMSs that deeply integrates LLM capabilities and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). FlockMTL includes model-driven scalar and aggregate functions, enabling chained predictions through tuple-level mappings and reductions. Drawing inspiration from the relational model, FlockMTL incorporates: (i) cost-based optimizations, which seamlessly apply techniques such as batching and caching; and (ii) resource independence, enabled through novel SQL DDL abstractions: PROMPT and MODEL, introduced as first-class schema objects alongside TABLE. FlockMTL streamlines the development of knowledge-intensive analytical applications, and its optimizations ease the implementation burden.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-Routing RAG: Binding Selective Retrieval with Knowledge Verbalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01018v1)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Selective retrieval improves retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) by reducing distractions from low-quality retrievals and improving efficiency. However, existing approaches under-utilize the inherent knowledge of large language models (LLMs), leading to suboptimal retrieval decisions and degraded generation performance. To bridge this gap, we propose Self-Routing RAG (SR-RAG), a novel framework that binds selective retrieval with knowledge verbalization. SR-RAG enables an LLM to dynamically decide between external retrieval and verbalizing its own parametric knowledge. To this end, we design a multi-task objective that jointly optimizes an LLM on knowledge source selection, knowledge verbalization, and response generation. We further introduce dynamic knowledge source inference via nearest neighbor search to improve the accuracy of knowledge source decision under domain shifts. Fine-tuning three LLMs with SR-RAG significantly improves both their response accuracy and inference latency. Compared to the strongest selective retrieval baseline, SR-RAG reduces retrievals by 29% while improving the performance by 5.1%.</p></details> | Work in Progress |
| **[TOBUGraph: Knowledge Graph-Based Retrieval for Enhanced LLM Performance Beyond RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05447v2)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is one of the leading and most widely used techniques for enhancing LLM retrieval capabilities, but it still faces significant limitations in commercial use cases. RAG primarily relies on the query-chunk text-to-text similarity in the embedding space for retrieval and can fail to capture deeper semantic relationships across chunks, is highly sensitive to chunking strategies, and is prone to hallucinations. To address these challenges, we propose TOBUGraph, a graph-based retrieval framework that first constructs the knowledge graph from unstructured data dynamically and automatically. Using LLMs, TOBUGraph extracts structured knowledge and diverse relationships among data, going beyond RAG's text-to-text similarity. Retrieval is achieved through graph traversal, leveraging the extracted relationships and structures to enhance retrieval accuracy, eliminating the need for chunking configurations while reducing hallucination. We demonstrate TOBUGraph's effectiveness in TOBU, a real-world application in production for personal memory organization and retrieval. Our evaluation using real user data demonstrates that TOBUGraph outperforms multiple RAG implementations in both precision and recall, significantly improving user experience through improved retrieval accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Contradiction Detection in RAG Systems: Evaluating LLMs as Context Validators for Improved Information Consistency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00180v1)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have emerged as a powerful method for enhancing large language models (LLMs) with up-to-date information. However, the retrieval step in RAG can sometimes surface documents containing contradictory information, particularly in rapidly evolving domains such as news. These contradictions can significantly impact the performance of LLMs, leading to inconsistent or erroneous outputs. This study addresses this critical challenge in two ways. First, we present a novel data generation framework to simulate different types of contradictions that may occur in the retrieval stage of a RAG system. Second, we evaluate the robustness of different LLMs in performing as context validators, assessing their ability to detect contradictory information within retrieved document sets. Our experimental results reveal that context validation remains a challenging task even for state-of-the-art LLMs, with performance varying significantly across different types of contradictions. While larger models generally perform better at contradiction detection, the effectiveness of different prompting strategies varies across tasks and model architectures. We find that chain-of-thought prompting shows notable improvements for some models but may hinder performance in others, highlighting the complexity of the task and the need for more robust approaches to context validation in RAG systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Systematic Evaluation of LLM Strategies for Mental Health Text Analysis: Fine-tuning vs. Prompt Engineering vs. RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24307v1)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study presents a systematic comparison of three approaches for the analysis of mental health text using large language models (LLMs): prompt engineering, retrieval augmented generation (RAG), and fine-tuning. Using LLaMA 3, we evaluate these approaches on emotion classification and mental health condition detection tasks across two datasets. Fine-tuning achieves the highest accuracy (91% for emotion classification, 80% for mental health conditions) but requires substantial computational resources and large training sets, while prompt engineering and RAG offer more flexible deployment with moderate performance (40-68% accuracy). Our findings provide practical insights for implementing LLM-based solutions in mental health applications, highlighting the trade-offs between accuracy, computational requirements, and deployment flexibility.</p></details> |  |
| **[A RAG-Based Multi-Agent LLM System for Natural Hazard Resilience and Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07877v3)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are a transformational capability at the frontier of artificial intelligence and machine learning that can support decision-makers in addressing pressing societal challenges such as extreme natural hazard events. As generalized models, LLMs often struggle to provide context-specific information, particularly in areas requiring specialized knowledge. In this work, we propose a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based multi-agent LLM system to support analysis and decision-making in the context of natural hazards and extreme weather events. As a proof of concept, we present WildfireGPT, a specialized system focused on wildfire scenarios. The architecture employs a user-centered, multi-agent design to deliver tailored risk insights across diverse stakeholder groups. By integrating domain-specific projection data, observational datasets, and scientific literature through a RAG framework, the system ensures both accuracy and contextual relevance of the information it provides. Evaluation across ten expert-led case studies demonstrates that WildfireGPT significantly outperforms existing LLM-based solutions for decision support in natural hazard and extreme weather contexts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Systematic Knowledge Injection into Large Language Models via Diverse Augmentation for Domain-Specific RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08356v3)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a prominent method for incorporating domain knowledge into Large Language Models (LLMs). While RAG enhances response relevance by incorporating retrieved domain knowledge in the context, retrieval errors can still lead to hallucinations and incorrect answers. To recover from retriever failures, domain knowledge is injected by fine-tuning the model to generate the correct response, even in the case of retrieval errors. However, we observe that without systematic knowledge augmentation, fine-tuned LLMs may memorize new information but still fail to extract relevant domain knowledge, leading to poor performance. In this work, we present a novel framework that significantly enhances the fine-tuning process by augmenting the training data in two ways -- context augmentation and knowledge paraphrasing. In context augmentation, we create multiple training samples for a given QA pair by varying the relevance of the retrieved information, teaching the model when to ignore and when to rely on retrieved content. In knowledge paraphrasing, we fine-tune with multiple answers to the same question, enabling LLMs to better internalize specialized knowledge. To mitigate catastrophic forgetting due to fine-tuning, we add a domain-specific identifier to a question and also utilize a replay buffer containing general QA pairs. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our method over existing techniques, achieving up to 10\% relative gain in token-level recall while preserving the LLM's generalization capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 14 tables, to be published in NAACL 2025</p></details> |
| **[Does RAG Introduce Unfairness in LLMs? Evaluating Fairness in Retrieval-Augmented Generation Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19804v2)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has recently gained significant attention for its enhanced ability to integrate external knowledge sources into open-domain question answering (QA) tasks. However, it remains unclear how these models address fairness concerns, particularly with respect to sensitive attributes such as gender, geographic location, and other demographic factors. First, as language models evolve to prioritize utility, like improving exact match accuracy, fairness considerations may have been largely overlooked. Second, the complex, multi-component architecture of RAG methods poses challenges in identifying and mitigating biases, as each component is optimized for distinct objectives. In this paper, we aim to empirically evaluate fairness in several RAG methods. We propose a fairness evaluation framework tailored to RAG, using scenario-based questions and analyzing disparities across demographic attributes. Our experimental results indicate that, despite recent advances in utility-driven optimization, fairness issues persist in both the retrieval and generation stages. These findings underscore the need for targeted interventions to address fairness concerns throughout the RAG pipeline. The dataset and code used in this study are publicly available at this GitHub Repository https://github.com/elviswxy/RAG_fairness .</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at COLING 2025</p></details> |
| **[Balancing Content Size in RAG-Text2SQL System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15723v3)** | 2025-03-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising solution for converting natural language queries into SQL commands, enabling seamless database interaction. However, these Text-to-SQL (Text2SQL) systems face inherent limitations, hallucinations, outdated knowledge, and untraceable reasoning. To address these challenges, the integration of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with Text2SQL models has gained traction. RAG serves as a retrieval mechanism, providing essential contextual information, such as table schemas and metadata, to enhance the query generation process. Despite their potential, RAG + Text2SQL systems are susceptible to the quality and size of retrieved documents. While richer document content can improve schema relevance and retrieval accuracy, it also introduces noise, increasing the risk of hallucinations and reducing query fidelity as the prompt size of the Text2SQL model increases. This research investigates the nuanced trade-off between document size and quality, aiming to strike a balance that optimizes system performance. Key thresholds are identified where performance degradation occurs, along with actionable strategies to mitigate these challenges. Additionally, we explore the phenomenon of hallucinations in Text2SQL models, emphasizing the critical role of curated document presentation in minimizing errors. Our findings provide a roadmap for enhancing the robustness of RAG + Text2SQL systems, offering practical insights for real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tuning LLMs by RAG Principles: Towards LLM-native Memory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16071v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Memory, additional information beyond the training of large language models (LLMs), is crucial to various real-world applications, such as personal assistant. The two mainstream solutions to incorporate memory into the generation process are long-context LLMs and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). In this paper, we first systematically compare these two types of solutions on three renovated/new datasets and show that (1) long-context solutions, although more expensive, shall be easier to capture the big picture and better answer queries which require considering the memory as a whole; and (2) when the queries concern specific information, RAG solutions shall be more competitive especially when the keywords can be explicitly matched. Therefore, we propose a novel method RAG-Tuned-LLM which fine-tunes a relative small (e.g., 7B) LLM using the data generated following the RAG principles, so it can combine the advantages of both solutions. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate that RAG-Tuned-LLM can beat long-context LLMs and RAG methods across a wide range of query types.</p></details> |  |

This section serves as a valuable resource for early-career researchers seeking unexplored areas and experienced researchers looking for new projects or collaborations. In this study, we generate future work suggestions from key sections of a scientific article alongside related papers and analyze how the trends have evolved. We experimented with various Large Language Models (LLMs) and integrated Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to enhance the generation process. We incorporate a LLM feedback mechanism to improve the quality of the generated content and propose an LLM-as-a-judge approach for evaluation. Our results demonstrated that the RAG-based approach with LLM feedback outperforms other methods evaluated through qualitative and quantitative metrics. Moreover, we conduct a human evaluation to assess the LLM as an extractor and judge. The code and dataset for this project are here, code: HuggingFace</p></details> | 19 pages, 5 figures |

The recent purposed Mixed-Precision Over-the-Air Federated Learning (MP-OTA-FL) enables clients to operate at appropriate precision levels based on their heterogeneous hardware, taking advantages of the larger trade-off space while covering the quantization overheads in the mixed-precision modulation scheme for the OTA aggregation process. A key to further exploring the potential of the MP-OTA-FL framework is the optimization of client precision levels. The choice of precision level hinges on multifaceted factors including hardware capability, potential client contribution, and user satisfaction, among which factors can be difficult to define or quantify. In this paper, we propose a RAG-based User Profiling for precision planning framework that integrates retrieval-augmented LLMs and dynamic client profiling to optimize satisfaction and contributions. This includes a hybrid interface for gathering device/user insights and an RAG database storing historical quantization decisions with feedback. Experiments show that our method boosts satisfaction, energy savings, and global model accuracy in MP-OTA-FL systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables, submitted to IEEE VTC 2025 fall for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[A RAG-based Question Answering System Proposal for Understanding Islam: MufassirQAS LLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15378v5)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Challenges exist in learning and understanding religions, such as the complexity and depth of religious doctrines and teachings. Chatbots as question-answering systems can help in solving these challenges. LLM chatbots use NLP techniques to establish connections between topics and accurately respond to complex questions. These capabilities make it perfect for enlightenment on religion as a question-answering chatbot. However, LLMs also tend to generate false information, known as hallucination. Also, the chatbots' responses can include content that insults personal religious beliefs, interfaith conflicts, and controversial or sensitive topics. It must avoid such cases without promoting hate speech or offending certain groups of people or their beliefs. This study uses a vector database-based Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approach to enhance the accuracy and transparency of LLMs. Our question-answering system is called "MufassirQAS". We created a database consisting of several open-access books that include Turkish context. These books contain Turkish translations and interpretations of Islam. This database is utilized to answer religion-related questions and ensure our answers are trustworthy. The relevant part of the dataset, which LLM also uses, is presented along with the answer. We have put careful effort into creating system prompts that give instructions to prevent harmful, offensive, or disrespectful responses to respect people's values and provide reliable results. The system answers and shares additional information, such as the page number from the respective book and the articles referenced for obtaining the information. MufassirQAS and ChatGPT are also tested with sensitive questions. We got better performance with our system. Study and enhancements are still in progress. Results and future works are given.</p></details> |  |
| **[SOSecure: Safer Code Generation with RAG and StackOverflow Discussions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13654v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used for automated code generation. Their reliance on infrequently updated pretraining data leaves them unaware of newly discovered vulnerabilities and evolving security standards, making them prone to producing insecure code. In contrast, developer communities on Stack Overflow (SO) provide an ever-evolving repository of knowledge, where security vulnerabilities are actively discussed and addressed through collective expertise. These community-driven insights remain largely untapped by LLMs. This paper introduces SOSecure, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that leverages the collective security expertise found in SO discussions to improve the security of LLM-generated code. We build a security-focused knowledge base by extracting SO answers and comments that explicitly identify vulnerabilities. Unlike common uses of RAG, SOSecure triggers after code has been generated to find discussions that identify flaws in similar code. These are used in a prompt to an LLM to consider revising the code. Evaluation across three datasets (SALLM, LLMSecEval, and LMSys) show that SOSecure achieves strong fix rates of 71.7%, 91.3%, and 96.7% respectively, compared to prompting GPT-4 without relevant discussions (49.1%, 56.5%, and 37.5%), and outperforms multiple other baselines. SOSecure operates as a language-agnostic complement to existing LLMs, without requiring retraining or fine-tuning, making it easy to deploy. Our results underscore the importance of maintaining active developer forums, which have dropped substantially in usage with LLM adoptions.</p></details> |  |
| **[MES-RAG: Bringing Multi-modal, Entity-Storage, and Secure Enhancements to RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13563v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) improves Large Language Models (LLMs) by using external knowledge, but it struggles with precise entity information retrieval. In this paper, we proposed MES-RAG framework, which enhances entity-specific query handling and provides accurate, secure, and consistent responses. MES-RAG introduces proactive security measures that ensure system integrity by applying protections prior to data access. Additionally, the system supports real-time multi-modal outputs, including text, images, audio, and video, seamlessly integrating into existing RAG architectures. Experimental results demonstrate that MES-RAG significantly improves both accuracy and recall, highlighting its effectiveness in advancing the security and utility of question-answering, increasing accuracy to 0.83 (+0.25) on targeted task. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/wpydcr/MES-RAG.</p></details> | NAACL 2025 |
| **[Privacy-Aware RAG: Secure and Isolated Knowledge Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15548v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread adoption of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems in real-world applications has heightened concerns about the confidentiality and integrity of their proprietary knowledge bases. These knowledge bases, which play a critical role in enhancing the generative capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), are increasingly vulnerable to breaches that could compromise sensitive information. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an advanced encryption methodology designed to protect RAG systems from unauthorized access and data leakage. Our approach encrypts both textual content and its corresponding embeddings prior to storage, ensuring that all data remains securely encrypted. This mechanism restricts access to authorized entities with the appropriate decryption keys, thereby significantly reducing the risk of unintended data exposure. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our encryption strategy preserves the performance and functionality of RAG pipelines, ensuring compatibility across diverse domains and applications. To validate the robustness of our method, we provide comprehensive security proofs that highlight its resilience against potential threats and vulnerabilities. These proofs also reveal limitations in existing approaches, which often lack robustness, adaptability, or reliance on open-source models. Our findings suggest that integrating advanced encryption techniques into the design and deployment of RAG systems can effectively enhance privacy safeguards. This research contributes to the ongoing discourse on improving security measures for AI-driven services and advocates for stricter data protection standards within RAG architectures.</p></details> |  |
| **[RAG-KG-IL: A Multi-Agent Hybrid Framework for Reducing Hallucinations and Enhancing LLM Reasoning through RAG and Incremental Knowledge Graph Learning Integration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13514v1)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents RAG-KG-IL, a novel multi-agent hybrid framework designed to enhance the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Knowledge Graphs (KGs) with an Incremental Learning (IL) approach. Despite recent advancements, LLMs still face significant challenges in reasoning with structured data, handling dynamic knowledge evolution, and mitigating hallucinations, particularly in mission-critical domains. Our proposed RAG-KG-IL framework addresses these limitations by employing a multi-agent architecture that enables continuous knowledge updates, integrates structured knowledge, and incorporates autonomous agents for enhanced explainability and reasoning. The framework utilizes RAG to ensure the generated responses are grounded in verifiable information, while KGs provide structured domain knowledge for improved consistency and depth of understanding. The Incremental Learning approach allows for dynamic updates to the knowledge base without full retraining, significantly reducing computational overhead and improving the model's adaptability. We evaluate the framework using real-world case studies involving health-related queries, comparing it to state-of-the-art models like GPT-4o and a RAG-only baseline. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces hallucination rates and improves answer completeness and reasoning accuracy. The results underscore the potential of combining RAG, KGs, and multi-agent systems to create intelligent, adaptable systems capable of real-time knowledge integration and reasoning in complex domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Taxonomic Reasoning for Rare Arthropods: Combining Dense Image Captioning and RAG for Interpretable Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10886v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the context of pressing climate change challenges and the significant biodiversity loss among arthropods, automated taxonomic classification from organismal images is a subject of intense research. However, traditional AI pipelines based on deep neural visual architectures such as CNNs or ViTs face limitations such as degraded performance on the long-tail of classes and the inability to reason about their predictions. We integrate image captioning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with large language models (LLMs) to enhance biodiversity monitoring, showing particular promise for characterizing rare and unknown arthropod species. While a naive Vision-Language Model (VLM) excels in classifying images of common species, the RAG model enables classification of rarer taxa by matching explicit textual descriptions of taxonomic features to contextual biodiversity text data from external sources. The RAG model shows promise in reducing overconfidence and enhancing accuracy relative to naive LLMs, suggesting its viability in capturing the nuances of taxonomic hierarchy, particularly at the challenging family and genus levels. Our findings highlight the potential for modern vision-language AI pipelines to support biodiversity conservation initiatives, emphasizing the role of comprehensive data curation and collaboration with citizen science platforms to improve species identification, unknown species characterization and ultimately inform conservation strategies.</p></details> | 12 pages, 3 figures |
| **[ClaimTrust: Propagation Trust Scoring for RAG Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10702v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid adoption of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems has revolutionized large-scale content generation but has also highlighted the challenge of ensuring trustworthiness in retrieved information. This paper introduces ClaimTrust, a propagation-based trust scoring framework that dynamically evaluates the reliability of documents in a RAG system. Using a modified PageRank-inspired algorithm, ClaimTrust propagates trust scores across documents based on relationships derived from extracted factual claims. We preprocess and analyze 814 political news articles from Kaggle's Fake News Detection Dataset to extract 2,173 unique claims and classify 965 meaningful relationships (supporting or contradicting). By representing the dataset as a document graph, ClaimTrust iteratively updates trust scores until convergence, effectively differentiating trustworthy articles from unreliable ones. Our methodology, which leverages embedding-based filtering for efficient claim comparison and relationship classification, achieves a 11.2% of significant connections while maintaining computational scalability. Experimental results demonstrate that ClaimTrust successfully assigns higher trust scores to verified documents while penalizing those containing false information. Future directions include fine-tuned claim extract and compare (Li et al., 2022), parameter optimization, enhanced language model utilization, and robust evaluation metrics to generalize the framework across diverse datasets and domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 2 figures, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[RAG-Adapter: A Plug-and-Play RAG-enhanced Framework for Long Video Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08576v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) capable of video understanding are advancing rapidly. To effectively assess their video comprehension capabilities, long video understanding benchmarks, such as Video-MME and MLVU, are proposed. However, these benchmarks directly use uniform frame sampling for testing, which results in significant information loss and affects the accuracy of the evaluations in reflecting the true abilities of MLLMs. To address this, we propose RAG-Adapter, a plug-and-play framework that reduces information loss during testing by sampling frames most relevant to the given question. Additionally, we introduce a Grouped-supervised Contrastive Learning (GCL) method to further enhance sampling effectiveness of RAG-Adapter through fine-tuning on our constructed MMAT dataset. Finally, we test numerous baseline MLLMs on various video understanding benchmarks, finding that RAG-Adapter sampling consistently outperforms uniform sampling (e.g., Accuracy of GPT-4o increases by 9.3 percent on Video-MME), providing a more accurate testing method for long video benchmarks.</p></details> | 37 pages, 36 figures |
| **[RAAD-LLM: Adaptive Anomaly Detection Using LLMs and RAG Integration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02800v3)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection in complex industrial environments poses unique challenges, particularly in contexts characterized by data sparsity and evolving operational conditions. Predictive maintenance (PdM) in such settings demands methodologies that are adaptive, transferable, and capable of integrating domain-specific knowledge. In this paper, we present RAAD-LLM, a novel framework for adaptive anomaly detection, leveraging large language models (LLMs) integrated with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). This approach addresses the aforementioned PdM challenges. By effectively utilizing domain-specific knowledge, RAAD-LLM enhances the detection of anomalies in time series data without requiring fine-tuning on specific datasets. The framework's adaptability mechanism enables it to adjust its understanding of normal operating conditions dynamically, thus increasing detection accuracy. We validate this methodology through a real-world application for a plastics manufacturing plant and the Skoltech Anomaly Benchmark (SKAB). Results show significant improvements over our previous model with an accuracy increase from 70.7% to 88.6% on the real-world dataset. By allowing for the enriching of input series data with semantics, RAAD-LLM incorporates multimodal capabilities that facilitate more collaborative decision-making between the model and plant operators. Overall, our findings support RAAD-LLM's ability to revolutionize anomaly detection methodologies in PdM, potentially leading to a paradigm shift in how anomaly detection is implemented across various industries.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2411.00914</p></details> |
| **[OpenRAG: Optimizing RAG End-to-End via In-Context Retrieval Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08398v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we analyze and empirically show that the learned relevance for conventional information retrieval (IR) scenarios may be inconsistent in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce OpenRAG, a RAG framework that is optimized end-to-end by tuning the retriever to capture in-context relevance, enabling adaptation to the diverse and evolving needs. Extensive experiments across a wide range of tasks demonstrate that OpenRAG, by tuning a retriever end-to-end, leads to a consistent improvement of 4.0% over the original retriever, consistently outperforming existing state-of-the-art retrievers by 2.1%. Additionally, our results indicate that for some tasks, an end-to-end tuned 0.2B retriever can achieve improvements that surpass those of RAG-oriented or instruction-tuned 8B large language models (LLMs), highlighting the cost-effectiveness of our approach in enhancing RAG systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[OCR Hinders RAG: Evaluating the Cascading Impact of OCR on Retrieval-Augmented Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02592v2)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating external knowledge to reduce hallucinations and incorporate up-to-date information without retraining. As an essential part of RAG, external knowledge bases are commonly built by extracting structured data from unstructured PDF documents using Optical Character Recognition (OCR). However, given the imperfect prediction of OCR and the inherent non-uniform representation of structured data, knowledge bases inevitably contain various OCR noises. In this paper, we introduce OHRBench, the first benchmark for understanding the cascading impact of OCR on RAG systems. OHRBench includes 8,561 carefully selected unstructured document images from seven real-world RAG application domains, along with 8,498 Q&A pairs derived from multimodal elements in documents, challenging existing OCR solutions used for RAG. To better understand OCR's impact on RAG systems, we identify two primary types of OCR noise: Semantic Noise and Formatting Noise and apply perturbation to generate a set of structured data with varying degrees of each OCR noise. Using OHRBench, we first conduct a comprehensive evaluation of current OCR solutions and reveal that none is competent for constructing high-quality knowledge bases for RAG systems. We then systematically evaluate the impact of these two noise types and demonstrate the trend relationship between the degree of OCR noise and RAG performance. Our OHRBench, including PDF documents, Q&As, and the ground truth structured data are released at: https://github.com/opendatalab/OHR-Bench</p></details> | Work in progress |

We demonstrate that RAG systems that operate on databases with untrusted content are vulnerable to denial-of-service attacks we call jamming. An adversary can add a single ``blocker'' document to the database that will be retrieved in response to a specific query and result in the RAG system not answering this query, ostensibly because it lacks relevant information or because the answer is unsafe. We describe and measure the efficacy of several methods for generating blocker documents, including a new method based on black-box optimization. Our method (1) does not rely on instruction injection, (2) does not require the adversary to know the embedding or LLM used by the target RAG system, and (3) does not employ an auxiliary LLM. We evaluate jamming attacks on several embeddings and LLMs and demonstrate that the existing safety metrics for LLMs do not capture their vulnerability to jamming. We then discuss defenses against blocker documents.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in USENIX Security Symposium 2025</p></details> |

However, the specialized nature of biochemical data often necessitates costly domain-specific fine-tuning, posing critical challenges. First, it hinders the application of more flexible general-purpose LLMs in cutting-edge drug discovery tasks. More importantly, it impedes the rapid integration of the vast amounts of scientific data continuously generated through experiments and research. To investigate these challenges, we propose CLADD, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-empowered agentic system tailored to drug discovery tasks. Through the collaboration of multiple LLM agents, CLADD dynamically retrieves information from biomedical knowledge bases, contextualizes query molecules, and integrates relevant evidence to generate responses -- all without the need for domain-specific fine-tuning. Crucially, we tackle key obstacles in applying RAG workflows to biochemical data, including data heterogeneity, ambiguity, and multi-source integration. We demonstrate the flexibility and effectiveness of this framework across a variety of drug discovery tasks, showing that it outperforms general-purpose and domain-specific LLMs as well as traditional deep learning approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Machi...</summary><p>Machine Learning, Drug Discovery</p></details> |

However, these modules are usually separately trained. We argue that a system like RAG that incorporates multiple modules should be jointly optimized to achieve optimal performance. To demonstrate this, we design a specific pipeline called \textbf{SmartRAG} that includes a policy network and a retriever. The policy network can serve as 1) a decision maker that decides when to retrieve, 2) a query rewriter to generate a query most suited to the retriever, and 3) an answer generator that produces the final response with/without the observations. We then propose to jointly optimize the whole system using a reinforcement learning algorithm, with the reward designed to encourage the system to achieve the best performance with minimal retrieval cost. When jointly optimized, all the modules can be aware of how other modules are working and thus find the best way to work together as a complete system. Empirical results demonstrate that the jointly optimized SmartRAG can achieve better performance than separately optimized counterparts.</p></details> |  |

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising solution to enhance LLMs accuracy by incorporating external knowledge. However, traditional RAG systems struggle with processing complex relational information and multi-step reasoning, limiting their effectiveness in advanced problem-solving tasks. To address these limitations, we propose CogGRAG, a cognition inspired graph-based RAG framework, designed to improve LLMs performance in Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA). Inspired by the human cognitive process of decomposing complex problems and performing self-verification, our framework introduces a three-stage methodology: decomposition, retrieval, and reasoning with self-verification. By integrating these components, CogGRAG enhances the accuracy of LLMs in complex problem solving. We conduct systematic experiments with three LLM backbones on four benchmark datasets, where CogGRAG outperforms the baselines.</p></details> |  |

While RAG enhances MLLMs by grounding responses in query-relevant external knowledge, this reliance poses a critical yet underexplored safety risk: knowledge poisoning attacks, where misinformation or irrelevant knowledge is intentionally injected into external knowledge bases to manipulate model outputs to be incorrect and even harmful. To expose such vulnerabilities in multimodal RAG, we propose MM-PoisonRAG, a novel knowledge poisoning attack framework with two attack strategies: Localized Poisoning Attack (LPA), which injects query-specific misinformation in both text and images for targeted manipulation, and Globalized Poisoning Attack (GPA) to provide false guidance during MLLM generation to elicit nonsensical responses across all queries. We evaluate our attacks across multiple tasks, models, and access settings, demonstrating that LPA successfully manipulates the MLLM to generate attacker-controlled answers, with a success rate of up to 56% on MultiModalQA. Moreover, GPA completely disrupts model generation to 0% accuracy with just a single irrelevant knowledge injection. Our results highlight the urgent need for robust defenses against knowledge poisoning to safeguard multimodal RAG frameworks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is available at https://github.com/HyeonjeongHa/MM-PoisonRAG</p></details> |

Although these speech act indicators communicate the user\textquotesingle s intent -- whether it is asking a question, making a request, or stating a fact -- they do not necessarily add to the core informational content of the query itself. This paper investigates whether extracting the underlying propositional content from user utterances -- essentially stripping away the linguistic markers of intent -- can improve retrieval quality in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Drawing upon foundational insights from speech act theory, we propose a practical method for automatically transforming queries into their propositional equivalents before embedding. To assess the efficacy of this approach, we conducted an experimental study involving 63 user queries related to a Brazilian telecommunications news corpus with precomputed semantic embeddings. Results demonstrate clear improvements in semantic similarity between query embeddings and document embeddings at top ranks, confirming that queries stripped of speech act indicators more effectively retrieve relevant content.</p></details> | 19 pages, 4 figures |

Built from heterologous data of NASDAQ 100 companies, FinTMMBench offers three significant advantages. 1) Multi-modal Corpus: It encompasses a hybrid of financial tables, news articles, daily stock prices, and visual technical charts as the corpus. 2) Temporal-aware Questions: Each question requires the retrieval and interpretation of its relevant data over a specific time period, including daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, and annual periods. 3) Diverse Financial Analysis Tasks: The questions involve 10 different tasks, including information extraction, trend analysis, sentiment analysis and event detection, etc. We further propose a novel TMMHybridRAG method, which first leverages LLMs to convert data from other modalities (e.g., tabular, visual and time-series data) into textual format and then incorporates temporal information in each node when constructing graphs and dense indexes. Its effectiveness has been validated in extensive experiments, but notable gaps remain, highlighting the challenges presented by our FinTMMBench.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[Beyond RAG: Task-Aware KV Cache Compression for Comprehensive Knowledge Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04973v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Incorporating external knowledge in large language models (LLMs) enhances their utility across diverse applications, but existing methods have trade-offs. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) fetches evidence via similarity search, but key information may fall outside top ranked results. Long-context models can process multiple documents but are computationally expensive and limited by context window size. Inspired by students condensing study material for open-book exams, we propose task-aware key-value (KV) cache compression, which compresses external knowledge in a zero- or few-shot setup. This enables LLMs to reason efficiently over a compacted representation of all relevant information. Experiments show our approach outperforms both RAG and task-agnostic compression methods. On LongBench v2, it improves accuracy by up to 7 absolute points over RAG with a 30x compression rate, while reducing inference latency from 0.43s to 0.16s. A synthetic dataset highlights that RAG performs well when sparse evidence suffices, whereas task-aware compression is superior for broad knowledge tasks.</p></details> |  |

Although previous studies noted that retrieving many documents can degrade performance, they did not isolate how the quantity of documents affects performance while controlling for context length. We evaluate various language models on custom datasets derived from a multi-hop QA task. We keep the context length and position of relevant information constant while varying the number of documents, and find that increasing the document count in RAG settings poses significant challenges for LLMs. Additionally, our results indicate that processing multiple documents is a separate challenge from handling long contexts. We also make the datasets and code available: https://github.com/shaharl6000/MoreDocsSameLen .</p></details> | Preprint |

A number of graph-based RAG methods have been proposed in the literature. However, these methods have not been systematically and comprehensively compared under the same experimental settings. In this paper, we first summarize a unified framework to incorporate all graph-based RAG methods from a high-level perspective. We then extensively compare representative graph-based RAG methods over a range of questing-answering (QA) datasets -- from specific questions to abstract questions -- and examine the effectiveness of all methods, providing a thorough analysis of graph-based RAG approaches. As a byproduct of our experimental analysis, we are also able to identify new variants of the graph-based RAG methods over specific QA and abstract QA tasks respectively, by combining existing techniques, which outperform the state-of-the-art methods. Finally, based on these findings, we offer promising research opportunities. We believe that a deeper understanding of the behavior of existing methods can provide new valuable insights for future research.</p></details> |  |

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers an effective method for achieving this by retrieving the most relevant fragments into LLMs. However, the advancements in context window size for LLMs offer an alternative approach, raising the question of whether RAG remains necessary for effectively handling external knowledge. Several existing studies provide inconclusive comparisons between RAG and long-context (LC) LLMs, largely due to limitations in the benchmark designs. In this paper, we present LaRA, a novel benchmark specifically designed to rigorously compare RAG and LC LLMs. LaRA encompasses 2326 test cases across four practical QA task categories and three types of naturally occurring long texts. Through systematic evaluation of seven open-source and four proprietary LLMs, we find that the optimal choice between RAG and LC depends on a complex interplay of factors, including the model's parameter size, long-text capabilities, context length, task type, and the characteristics of the retrieved chunks. Our findings provide actionable guidelines for practitioners to effectively leverage both RAG and LC approaches in developing and deploying LLM applications.

While many studies focus on evaluating the overall quality of end-to-end RAG systems, there is a gap in understanding the appropriateness of LLMs for the RAG task. To address this, we introduce Trust-Score, a holistic metric that evaluates the trustworthiness of LLMs within the RAG framework. Our results show that various prompting methods, such as in-context learning, fail to effectively adapt LLMs to the RAG task as measured by Trust-Score. Consequently, we propose Trust-Align, a method to align LLMs for improved Trust-Score performance. 26 out of 27 models aligned using Trust-Align substantially outperform competitive baselines on ASQA, QAMPARI, and ELI5. Specifically, in LLaMA-3-8b, Trust-Align outperforms FRONT on ASQA (up 12.56), QAMPARI (up 36.04), and ELI5 (up 17.69). Trust-Align also significantly enhances models' ability to correctly refuse and provide quality citations. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of Trust-Align across different open-weight models, including the LLaMA series (1b to 8b), Qwen-2.5 series (0.5b to 7b), and Phi3.5 (3.8b).

However, evaluating the effectiveness of RAG systems in specialized scenarios remains challenging due to the high costs of data construction and the lack of suitable evaluation metrics. This paper introduces RAGEval, a framework designed to assess RAG systems across diverse scenarios by generating high-quality documents, questions, answers, and references through a schema-based pipeline. With a focus on factual accuracy, we propose three novel metrics: Completeness, Hallucination, and Irrelevance to evaluate LLM generated responses rigorously. Experimental results show that RAGEval outperforms zero-shot and one-shot methods in terms of clarity, safety, conformity, and richness of generated samples. Furthermore, the use of LLMs for scoring the proposed metrics demonstrates a high level of consistency with human evaluations. RAGEval establishes a new paradigm for evaluating RAG systems in real-world applications.

| **[SAGE: A Framework of Precise Retrieval for RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01713v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has demonstrated significant proficiency in conducting question-answering (QA) tasks within a specified corpus. Nonetheless, numerous failure instances of RAG in QA still exist. These failures are not solely attributable to the limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs); instead, they predominantly arise from the retrieval of inaccurate information for LLMs due to two limitations: (1) Current RAG methods segment the corpus without considering semantics, making it difficult to find relevant context due to impaired correlation between questions and the segments. (2) There is a trade-off between missing essential context with fewer context retrieved and getting irrelevant context with more context retrieved. In this paper, we introduce a RAG framework (SAGE), to overcome these limitations. First, to address the segmentation issue without considering semantics, we propose to train a semantic segmentation model. This model is trained to segment the corpus into semantically complete chunks. Second, to ensure that only the most relevant chunks are retrieved while the irrelevant ones are ignored, we design a chunk selection algorithm to dynamically select chunks based on the decreasing speed of the relevance score, leading to a more relevant selection. Third, to further ensure the precision of the retrieved chunks, we propose letting LLMs assess whether retrieved chunks are excessive or lacking and then adjust the amount of context accordingly. Experiments show that SAGE outperforms baselines by 61.25% in the quality of QA on average. Moreover, by avoiding retrieving noisy context, SAGE lowers the cost of the tokens consumed in LLM inference and achieves a 49.41% enhancement in cost efficiency on average. Additionally, our work offers valuable insights for boosting RAG.</p></details> |  |

To overcome the limitations of existing methods, this paper shifts away from prior dedicated heuristic approaches and revisits the most fundamental idea to HR perception by enhancing the long-context capability of MLLMs, driven by recent advances in long-context techniques like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for general LLMs. Towards this end, this paper presents the first study exploring the use of RAG to address HR perception challenges. Specifically, we propose Retrieval-Augmented Perception (RAP), a training-free framework that retrieves and fuses relevant image crops while preserving spatial context using the proposed Spatial-Awareness Layout. To accommodate different tasks, the proposed Retrieved-Exploration Search (RE-Search) dynamically selects the optimal number of crops based on model confidence and retrieval scores. Experimental results on HR benchmarks demonstrate the significant effectiveness of RAP, with LLaVA-v1.5-13B achieving a 43% improvement on $V^*$ Bench and 19% on HR-Bench.</p></details> |  |

Recent progress in Medical Large Vision-Language Models (Med-LVLMs) has opened up new possibilities for interactive diagnostic tools. However, these models often suffer from factual hallucination, which can lead to incorrect diagnoses. Fine-tuning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) have emerged as methods to address these issues. However, the amount of high-quality data and distribution shifts between training data and deployment data limit the application of fine-tuning methods. Although RAG is lightweight and effective, existing RAG-based approaches are not sufficiently general to different medical domains and can potentially cause misalignment issues, both between modalities and between the model and the ground truth. In this paper, we propose a versatile multimodal RAG system, MMed-RAG, designed to enhance the factuality of Med-LVLMs. Our approach introduces a domain-aware retrieval mechanism, an adaptive retrieved contexts selection method, and a provable RAG-based preference fine-tuning strategy. These innovations make the RAG process sufficiently general and reliable, significantly improving alignment when introducing retrieved contexts. Experimental results across five medical datasets (involving radiology, ophthalmology, pathology) on medical VQA and report generation demonstrate that MMed-RAG can achieve an average improvement of 43.8% in the factual accuracy of Med-LVLMs. Our data and code are available in https://github.com/richard-peng-xia/MMed-RAG.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

In this paper, we propose a generative AI-powered GATE question-answering framework (GATE stands for Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering) that leverages LLMs to explain GATE solutions and support students in their exam preparation. We conducted extensive benchmarking to select the optimal embedding model and LLM, evaluating our framework based on criteria such as latency, faithfulness, and relevance, with additional validation through human evaluation. Our chatbot integrates state-of-the-art embedding models and LLMs to deliver accurate, context-aware responses. Through rigorous experimentation, we identified configurations that balance performance and computational efficiency, ensuring a reliable chatbot to serve students' needs. Additionally, we discuss the challenges faced in data processing and modeling and implemented solutions. Our work explores the application of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for GATE Q/A explanation tasks, and our findings demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval accuracy and response quality.

| **[Post-training an LLM for RAG? Train on Self-Generated Demonstrations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10596v2)** | 2025-03-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) often struggle with knowledge intensive NLP tasks, such as answering "Who won the latest World Cup?" because the knowledge they learn during training may be insufficient or outdated. Conditioning generation on retrieved documents -- a technique known as retrieval augmented generation (RAG) -- mitigates these shortcomings by allowing the model to leverage in-context information. Practitioners can improve LLM RAG performance by fine-tuning on retrieval-augmented instructions, but must beware that this can cause undesirable model behaviors like hallucinations. We attribute this degradation to the fact that the training data is likely to be out-of-distribution for the model and may suffer from quality issues, such as misalignment between retrievals and target responses (since retrievals are frequently added post-hoc). We propose a recipe for training RAG-enabled LLMs using self-generated demonstrations, thereby avoiding training on out-of-distribution text and integrating retrievals into the LLM responses. We evaluate our method on knowledge intensive question answering (QA) tasks and show that our method teaches LLMs to properly handle in-context retrievals and abstain from questions it will likely get wrong. Compared to conventional RA-IT methods, our method prevents model degradation in non-RAG settings while exhibiting superior QA performance.</p></details> |  |

To address the fragmented evaluation paradigms and limited cases in existing Needle-in-a-Haystack (NIAH), this paper introduces U-NIAH, a unified framework that systematically compares LLMs and RAG methods in controlled long context settings. Our framework extends beyond traditional NIAH by incorporating multi-needle, long-needle, and needle-in-needle configurations, along with different retrieval settings, while leveraging the synthetic Starlight Academy dataset-a fictional magical universe-to eliminate biases from pre-trained knowledge. Through extensive experiments, we investigate three research questions: (1) performance trade-offs between LLMs and RAG, (2) error patterns in RAG, and (3) RAG's limitations in complex settings. Our findings show that RAG significantly enhances smaller LLMs by mitigating the "lost-in-the-middle" effect and improving robustness, achieving an 82.58% win-rate over LLMs. However, we observe that retrieval noise and reverse chunk ordering degrade performance, while surprisingly, advanced reasoning LLMs exhibit reduced RAG compatibility due to sensitivity to semantic distractors. We identify typical error patterns including omission due to noise, hallucination under high noise critical condition, and self-doubt behaviors. Our work not only highlights the complementary roles of RAG and LLMs, but also provides actionable insights for optimizing deployments.

However, these models face challenges in retrieving precise information from vast datasets. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) was developed to combining LLMs with external information retrieval systems to enhance the accuracy and context of responses. Despite improvements, RAG still struggles with comprehensive retrieval in high-volume, low-information-density databases and lacks relational awareness, leading to fragmented answers. To address this, this paper introduces the Pseudo-Knowledge Graph (PKG) framework, designed to overcome these limitations by integrating Meta-path Retrieval, In-graph Text and Vector Retrieval into LLMs. By preserving natural language text and leveraging various retrieval techniques, the PKG offers a richer knowledge representation and improves accuracy in information retrieval. Extensive evaluations using Open Compass and MultiHop-RAG benchmarks demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in managing large volumes of data and complex relationships.</p></details> |  |

However, these methods rely on unrealistic white-box assumptions, such as attackers having access to RAG systems' internal processes. To address this issue, we introduce a realistic black-box attack scenario based on the RAG paradox, where RAG systems inadvertently expose vulnerabilities while attempting to enhance trustworthiness. Because RAG systems reference external documents during response generation, our attack targets these sources without requiring internal access. Our approach first identifies the external sources disclosed by RAG systems and then automatically generates poisoned documents with misinformation designed to match these sources. Finally, these poisoned documents are newly published on the disclosed sources, disrupting the RAG system's response generation process. Both offline and online experiments confirm that this attack significantly reduces RAG performance without requiring internal access. Furthermore, from an insider perspective within the RAG system, we propose a re-ranking method that acts as a fundamental safeguard, offering minimal protection against unforeseen attacks.</p></details> |  |

Different from traditional RAG methods that mostly deal with flat text chunks, the proposed method takes into account the relationship of multimodalities by using a graph structure. To do that, a graph modeling structure is defined based on document layout parsing. The structure of an input document is retained with the connection of text chunks, tables, and figures. This representation allows the method to handle complex questions that require information from multimodalities. To confirm the efficiency of the graph modeling, a flexible RAG pipeline is developed using robust components.

| **[Speculative RAG: Enhancing Retrieval Augmented Generation through Drafting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08223v2)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) combines the generative abilities of large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge sources to provide more accurate and up-to-date responses. Recent RAG advancements focus on improving retrieval outcomes through iterative LLM refinement or self-critique capabilities acquired through additional instruction tuning of LLMs. In this work, we introduce Speculative RAG - a framework that leverages a larger generalist LM to efficiently verify multiple RAG drafts produced in parallel by a smaller, distilled specialist LM. Each draft is generated from a distinct subset of retrieved documents, offering diverse perspectives on the evidence while reducing input token counts per draft. This approach enhances comprehension of each subset and mitigates potential position bias over long context. Our method accelerates RAG by delegating drafting to the smaller specialist LM, with the larger generalist LM performing a single verification pass over the drafts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Speculative RAG achieves state-of-the-art performance with reduced latency on TriviaQA, MuSiQue, PopQA, PubHealth, and ARC-Challenge benchmarks. It notably enhances accuracy by up to 12.97% while reducing latency by 50.83% compared to conventional RAG systems on PubHealth.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[OntologyRAG: Better and Faster Biomedical Code Mapping with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Leveraging Ontology Knowledge Graphs and Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18992v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Biomedical ontologies, which comprehensively define concepts and relations for biomedical entities, are crucial for structuring and formalizing domain-specific information representations. Biomedical code mapping identifies similarity or equivalence between concepts from different ontologies. Obtaining high-quality mapping usually relies on automatic generation of unrefined mapping with ontology domain fine-tuned language models (LMs), followed by manual selections or corrections by coding experts who have extensive domain expertise and familiarity with ontology schemas. The LMs usually provide unrefined code mapping suggestions as a list of candidates without reasoning or supporting evidence, hence coding experts still need to verify each suggested candidate against ontology sources to pick the best matches. This is also a recurring task as ontology sources are updated regularly to incorporate new research findings. Consequently, the need of regular LM retraining and manual refinement make code mapping time-consuming and labour intensive. In this work, we created OntologyRAG, an ontology-enhanced retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) method that leverages the inductive biases from ontological knowledge graphs for in-context-learning (ICL) in large language models (LLMs). Our solution grounds LLMs to knowledge graphs with unrefined mappings between ontologies and processes questions by generating an interpretable set of results that include prediction rational with mapping proximity assessment. Our solution doesn't require re-training LMs, as all ontology updates could be reflected by updating the knowledge graphs with a standard process. Evaluation results on a self-curated gold dataset show promises of using our method to enable coding experts to achieve better and faster code mapping. The code is available at https://github.com/iqvianlp/ontologyRAG.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted as a workshop paper for KEIR@ECIR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Faster, Cheaper, Better: Multi-Objective Hyperparameter Optimization for LLM and RAG Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18635v1)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a popular technique for improving Large Language Model (LLM) systems, it introduces a large number of choices, parameters and hyperparameters that must be made or tuned. This includes the LLM, embedding, and ranker models themselves, as well as hyperparameters governing individual RAG components. Yet, collectively optimizing the entire configuration in a RAG or LLM system remains under-explored - especially in multi-objective settings - due to intractably large solution spaces, noisy objective evaluations, and the high cost of evaluations. In this work, we introduce the first approach for multi-objective parameter optimization of cost, latency, safety and alignment over entire LLM and RAG systems. We find that Bayesian optimization methods significantly outperform baseline approaches, obtaining a superior Pareto front on two new RAG benchmark tasks. We conclude our work with important considerations for practitioners who are designing multi-objective RAG systems, highlighting nuances such as how optimal configurations may not generalize across tasks and objectives.</p></details> |  |
| **[Ward: Provable RAG Dataset Inference via LLM Watermarks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03537v2)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>RAG enables LLMs to easily incorporate external data, raising concerns for data owners regarding unauthorized usage of their content. The challenge of detecting such unauthorized usage remains underexplored, with datasets and methods from adjacent fields being ill-suited for its study. We take several steps to bridge this gap. First, we formalize this problem as (black-box) RAG Dataset Inference (RAG-DI). We then introduce a novel dataset designed for realistic benchmarking of RAG-DI methods, alongside a set of baselines. Finally, we propose Ward, a method for RAG-DI based on LLM watermarks that equips data owners with rigorous statistical guarantees regarding their dataset's misuse in RAG corpora. Ward consistently outperforms all baselines, achieving higher accuracy, superior query efficiency and robustness. Our work provides a foundation for future studies of RAG-DI and highlights LLM watermarks as a promising approach to this problem.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

Yet, most existing work in RAG has underemphasized fair ranking techniques and neglected the diverse interests of all stakeholders. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study of RAG systems that incorporate fairness-aware rankings, focusing on both ranking fairness and attribution fairness - ensuring equitable exposure of sources cited in the final text. We specifically examine item-side fairness, i.e., whether retrieved documents receive balanced exposure, and assess how this affects both the system's overall performance and the eventual distribution of cited sources. Across twelve RAG models and seven tasks, we find that fairness-aware retrieval frequently retains or even improves ranking effectiveness and generation quality, countering the widespread belief that fairness compromises system performance. Moreover, we show that fair retrieval leads to more balanced attribution in the final responses, ensuring that the cited sources are credited more equitably. Our results underscore the importance of item-side fairness throughout both retrieval and generation phases, offering key insights for building more responsible and equitable RAG systems and illustrating promising avenues for future exploration in fair ranking and source attribution.</p></details> | <details><summary>Top 5...</summary><p>Top 5 Spotlight at AFME Workshop at NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |
| **[Evaluating the Effectiveness and Efficiency of Demonstration Retrievers in RAG for Coding Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09662v2)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating external knowledge bases, achieving state-of-the-art results in various coding tasks. The core of RAG is retrieving demonstration examples, which is essential to balance effectiveness (generation quality) and efficiency (retrieval time) for optimal performance. However, the high-dimensional nature of code representations and large knowledge bases often create efficiency bottlenecks, which are overlooked in previous research. This paper systematically evaluates the efficiency-effectiveness trade-off of retrievers across three coding tasks: Program Synthesis, Commit Message Generation, and Assertion Generation. We examined six retrievers: two sparse (BM25 and BM25L) and four dense retrievers, including one exhaustive dense retriever (SBERT's Semantic Search) and three approximate dense retrievers (ANNOY, LSH, and HNSW). Our findings show that while BM25 excels in effectiveness, it suffers in efficiency as the knowledge base grows beyond 1000 entries. In large-scale retrieval, efficiency differences become more pronounced, with approximate dense retrievers offering the greatest gains. For instance, in Commit Generation task, HNSW achieves a 44x speed up, while only with a 1.74% drop in RougeL compared with BM25. Our results also show that increasing the number of demonstrations in the prompt doesn't always improve the effectiveness and can increase latency and lead to incorrect outputs. Our findings provide valuable insights for practitioners aiming to build efficient and effective RAG systems for coding tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 6 figures, 6 tables, accepted by SANER 2025</p></details> |

In this work, we study the conflict between biases of each component and their relationship to the overall bias of the RAG system, which we call bias conflict. Examining both gender and political biases as case studies, we show that bias conflict can be characterized through a linear relationship among components despite its complexity in 6 different LLMs. Through comprehensive fine-tuning experiments creating 120 differently biased embedders, we demonstrate how to control bias while maintaining utility and reveal the importance of reverse-biasing the embedder to mitigate bias in the overall system. Additionally, we find that LLMs and tasks exhibit varying sensitivities to the embedder bias, a crucial factor to consider for debiasing. Our results underscore that a fair RAG system can be better achieved by carefully controlling the bias of the embedder rather than increasing its fairness.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages (8 main), 12 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

We present LettuceDetect a framework that addresses two critical limitations in existing hallucination detection methods: (1) the context window constraints of traditional encoder-based methods, and (2) the computational inefficiency of LLM based approaches. Building on ModernBERT's extended context capabilities (up to 8k tokens) and trained on the RAGTruth benchmark dataset, our approach outperforms all previous encoder-based models and most prompt-based models, while being approximately 30 times smaller than the best models. LettuceDetect is a token-classification model that processes context-question-answer triples, allowing for the identification of unsupported claims at the token level. Evaluations on the RAGTruth corpus demonstrate an F1 score of 79.22% for example-level detection, which is a 14.8% improvement over Luna, the previous state-of-the-art encoder-based architecture. Additionally, the system can process 30 to 60 examples per second on a single GPU, making it more practical for real-world RAG applications.</p></details> | 6 pages |
| **[Don't Do RAG: When Cache-Augmented Generation is All You Need for Knowledge Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15605v2)** | 2025-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has gained traction as a powerful approach for enhancing language models by integrating external knowledge sources. However, RAG introduces challenges such as retrieval latency, potential errors in document selection, and increased system complexity. With the advent of large language models (LLMs) featuring significantly extended context windows, this paper proposes an alternative paradigm, cache-augmented generation (CAG) that bypasses real-time retrieval. Our method involves preloading all relevant resources, especially when the documents or knowledge for retrieval are of a limited and manageable size, into the LLM's extended context and caching its runtime parameters. During inference, the model utilizes these preloaded parameters to answer queries without additional retrieval steps. Comparative analyses reveal that CAG eliminates retrieval latency and minimizes retrieval errors while maintaining context relevance. Performance evaluations across multiple benchmarks highlight scenarios where long-context LLMs either outperform or complement traditional RAG pipelines. These findings suggest that, for certain applications, particularly those with a constrained knowledge base, CAG provide a streamlined and efficient alternative to RAG, achieving comparable or superior results with reduced complexity.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, accepted by the Web Conference 2025 (WWW '25) as a short paper</p></details> |
| **[Worse than Zero-shot? A Fact-Checking Dataset for Evaluating the Robustness of RAG Against Misleading Retrievals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16101v1)** | 2025-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has shown impressive capabilities in mitigating hallucinations in large language models (LLMs). However, LLMs struggle to handle misleading retrievals and often fail to maintain their own reasoning when exposed to conflicting or selectively-framed evidence, making them vulnerable to real-world misinformation. In such real-world retrieval scenarios, misleading and conflicting information is rampant, particularly in the political domain, where evidence is often selectively framed, incomplete, or polarized. However, existing RAG benchmarks largely assume a clean retrieval setting, where models succeed by accurately retrieving and generating answers from gold-standard documents. This assumption fails to align with real-world conditions, leading to an overestimation of RAG system performance. To bridge this gap, we introduce RAGuard, a fact-checking dataset designed to evaluate the robustness of RAG systems against misleading retrievals. Unlike prior benchmarks that rely on synthetic noise, our dataset constructs its retrieval corpus from Reddit discussions, capturing naturally occurring misinformation. It categorizes retrieved evidence into three types: supporting, misleading, and irrelevant, providing a realistic and challenging testbed for assessing how well RAG systems navigate different retrieval information. Our benchmark experiments reveal that when exposed to misleading retrievals, all tested LLM-powered RAG systems perform worse than their zero-shot baselines (i.e., no retrieval at all), highlighting their susceptibility to noisy environments. To the best of our knowledge, RAGuard is the first benchmark to systematically assess RAG robustness against misleading evidence. We expect this benchmark will drive future research toward improving RAG systems beyond idealized datasets, making them more reliable for real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

However, due to access restrictions, Large Language Models (LLMs) cannot retrieve these internal documents, limiting their ability to generate accurate zero-shot responses. To overcome this limitation, we use a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework powered by a Knowledge Graph (KG) to retrieve relevant information from external knowledge sources, enabling LLMs to answer questions over private or previously unseen document collections. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for building a high-quality, low-noise KG. We apply several techniques, including incremental entity resolution using seed concepts, similarity-based filtering to deduplicate entries, assigning confidence scores to entity-relation pairs to filter for high-confidence pairs, and linking facts to source documents for provenance. Our KG-RAG system retrieves relevant tuples, which are added to the user prompts context before being sent to the LLM generating the response. Our evaluation demonstrates that this approach significantly enhances response relevance, reducing irrelevant answers by over 50% and increasing fully relevant answers by 88% compared to the existing production system.</p></details> |  |
| **[Chain-of-Rank: Enhancing Large Language Models for Domain-Specific RAG in Edge Device](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15134v1)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with large language models (LLMs) is especially valuable in specialized domains, where precision is critical. To more specialize the LLMs into a target domain, domain-specific RAG has recently been developed by allowing the LLM to access the target domain early via finetuning. The domain-specific RAG makes more sense in resource-constrained environments like edge devices, as they should perform a specific task (e.g. personalization) reliably using only small-scale LLMs. While the domain-specific RAG is well-aligned with edge devices in this respect, it often relies on widely-used reasoning techniques like chain-of-thought (CoT). The reasoning step is useful to understand the given external knowledge, and yet it is computationally expensive and difficult for small-scale LLMs to learn it. Tackling this, we propose the Chain of Rank (CoR) which shifts the focus from intricate lengthy reasoning to simple ranking of the reliability of input external documents. Then, CoR reduces computational complexity while maintaining high accuracy, making it particularly suited for resource-constrained environments. We attain the state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in benchmarks, and analyze its efficacy.</p></details> | <details><summary>NAACL...</summary><p>NAACL 2025 (Findings)</p></details> |

Different from a standard retrieval task's objective of maximising the relevance of a set of top-ranked documents, a RAG system's objective is rather to maximise their total utility, where the utility of a document indicates whether including it as a part of the additional contextual information in an LLM prompt improves a downstream task. Existing studies investigate the role of the relevance of a RAG context for knowledge-intensive language tasks (KILT), where relevance essentially takes the form of answer containment. In contrast, in our work, relevance corresponds to that of topical overlap between a query and a document for an information seeking task. Specifically, we make use of an IR test collection to empirically investigate whether a RAG context comprised of topically relevant documents leads to improved downstream performance. Our experiments lead to the following findings: (a) there is a small positive correlation between relevance and utility; (b) this correlation decreases with increasing context sizes (higher values of k in k-shot); and (c) a more effective retrieval model generally leads to better downstream RAG performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages (including reference), 5 figures, 1 table, 48 references; this paper has been accepted by ECIR'25 as a full paper</p></details> |

Our approach combines RAG with Socratic dialogue to align a user's intuitive understanding of research topics with established Knowledge Organization Systems (KOSs). The proposed approach will effectively bridge "little semantics" (domain-specific KOS structures) with "big semantics" (broad bibliometric repositories), making complex academic taxonomies more accessible. Such agents have the potential for broad use. We illustrate with a sample application called CollabNext, which is a person-centric knowledge graph connecting people, organizations, and research topics. We further describe how the application design has an intentional focus on HBCUs and emerging researchers to raise visibility of people historically rendered invisible in the current science system.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 2 figures, AAAI 2025 Workshop on A Translational Institute for Knowledge Axiomatization</p></details> |

Given the challenges in continual learning with large language models (LLMs), retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become the dominant way to introduce new information. However, its reliance on vector retrieval hinders its ability to mimic the dynamic and interconnected nature of human long-term memory. Recent RAG approaches augment vector embeddings with various structures like knowledge graphs to address some of these gaps, namely sense-making and associativity. However, their performance on more basic factual memory tasks drops considerably below standard RAG. We address this unintended deterioration and propose HippoRAG 2, a framework that outperforms standard RAG comprehensively on factual, sense-making, and associative memory tasks. HippoRAG 2 builds upon the Personalized PageRank algorithm used in HippoRAG and enhances it with deeper passage integration and more effective online use of an LLM. This combination pushes this RAG system closer to the effectiveness of human long-term memory, achieving a 7% improvement in associative memory tasks over the state-of-the-art embedding model while also exhibiting superior factual knowledge and sense-making memory capabilities. This work paves the way for non-parametric continual learning for LLMs. Our code and data will be released at https://github.com/OSU-NLP-Group/HippoRAG.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and data to be released at: https://github.com/OSU-NLP-Group/HippoRAG</p></details> |

However, when the retrieval process involves private data, RAG systems may face severe privacy risks, potentially leading to the leakage of sensitive information. To address this issue, we propose using synthetic data as a privacy-preserving alternative for the retrieval data. We propose SAGE, a novel two-stage synthetic data generation paradigm. In the stage-1, we employ an attribute-based extraction and generation approach to preserve key contextual information from the original data. In the stage-2, we further enhance the privacy properties of the synthetic data through an agent-based iterative refinement process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that using our synthetic data as the retrieval context achieves comparable performance to using the original data while substantially reducing privacy risks. Our work takes the first step towards investigating the possibility of generating high-utility and privacy-preserving synthetic data for RAG, opening up new opportunities for the safe application of RAG systems in various domains.</p></details> |  |

This is critical given existing workforce shortages, especially in marginalized communities like Underrepresented Minorities (URM), who often lack access to quality education. Addressing these challenges, this research presents gAI-PT4I4, a Generative AI-based Personalized Tutor for Industrial 4.0, designed to personalize 4IR experiential learning. gAI-PT4I4 employs sentiment analysis to assess student comprehension, leveraging generative AI and finite automaton to tailor learning experiences. The framework integrates low-fidelity Digital Twins for VR-based training, featuring an Interactive Tutor - a generative AI assistant providing real-time guidance via audio and text. It uses zero-shot sentiment analysis with LLMs and prompt engineering, achieving 86\% accuracy in classifying student-teacher interactions as positive or negative. Additionally, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enables personalized learning content grounded in domain-specific knowledge. To adapt training dynamically, finite automaton structures exercises into states of increasing difficulty, requiring 80\% task-performance accuracy for progression. Experimental evaluation with 22 volunteers showed improved accuracy exceeding 80\%, reducing training time. Finally, this paper introduces a Multi-Fidelity Digital Twin model, aligning Digital Twin complexity with Bloom's Taxonomy and Kirkpatrick's model, providing a scalable educational framework.</p></details> |  |

However, RAG fails on global questions directed at an entire text corpus, such as "What are the main themes in the dataset?", since this is inherently a query-focused summarization (QFS) task, rather than an explicit retrieval task. Prior QFS methods, meanwhile, do not scale to the quantities of text indexed by typical RAG systems. To combine the strengths of these contrasting methods, we propose GraphRAG, a graph-based approach to question answering over private text corpora that scales with both the generality of user questions and the quantity of source text. Our approach uses an LLM to build a graph index in two stages: first, to derive an entity knowledge graph from the source documents, then to pregenerate community summaries for all groups of closely related entities. Given a question, each community summary is used to generate a partial response, before all partial responses are again summarized in a final response to the user. For a class of global sensemaking questions over datasets in the 1 million token range, we show that GraphRAG leads to substantial improvements over a conventional RAG baseline for both the comprehensiveness and diversity of generated answers.</p></details> |  |

To comprehensively evaluate the resilience of current RAG methods, we introduce HawkBench, a human-labeled, multi-domain benchmark designed to rigorously assess RAG performance across categorized task types. By stratifying tasks based on information-seeking behaviors, HawkBench provides a systematic evaluation of how well RAG systems adapt to diverse user needs. Unlike existing benchmarks, which focus primarily on specific task types (mostly factoid queries) and rely on varying knowledge bases, HawkBench offers: (1) systematic task stratification to cover a broad range of query types, including both factoid and rationale queries, (2) integration of multi-domain corpora across all task types to mitigate corpus bias, and (3) rigorous annotation for high-quality evaluation. HawkBench includes 1,600 high-quality test samples, evenly distributed across domains and task types. Using this benchmark, we evaluate representative RAG methods, analyzing their performance in terms of answer quality and response latency. Our findings highlight the need for dynamic task strategies that integrate decision-making, query interpretation, and global knowledge understanding to improve RAG generalizability. We believe HawkBench serves as a pivotal benchmark for advancing the resilience of RAG methods and their ability to achieve general-purpose information seeking.</p></details> | 13 pages |

It has been shown to enhance both generation quality and trustworthiness. While numerous works have focused on improving retrieval, generation, and evaluation, the role of reward models in reinforcement learning for optimizing RAG remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{RAG-Reward}, a framework designed to develop reward models to enable \textit{hallucination-free, comprehensive, reliable, and efficient RAG}. We define four key metrics to assess generation quality and develop an automated benchmarking pipeline to evaluate the outputs of multiple LLMs across a variety of RAG scenarios. Using \textbf{RAG-Reward}, we train reward models and apply {reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF)} to improve LLMs' effectiveness in RAG. Experimental results demonstrate that our reward model achieves state-of-the-art performance in automatic benchmarking and aligns closely with human evaluations. Furthermore, the improved generation quality of the trained policy model highlights the feasibility and efficiency of using RLHF to enhance RAG outputs.</p></details> | Preprint |

In this paper, we introduce an omnidirectional and automatic RAG benchmark, OmniEval, in the financial domain. Our benchmark is characterized by its multi-dimensional evaluation framework, including (1) a matrix-based RAG scenario evaluation system that categorizes queries into five task classes and 16 financial topics, leading to a structured assessment of diverse query scenarios; (2) a multi-dimensional evaluation data generation approach, which combines GPT-4-based automatic generation and human annotation, achieving an 87.47\% acceptance ratio in human evaluations on generated instances; (3) a multi-stage evaluation system that evaluates both retrieval and generation performance, result in a comprehensive evaluation on the RAG pipeline; and (4) robust evaluation metrics derived from rule-based and LLM-based ones, enhancing the reliability of assessments through manual annotations and supervised fine-tuning of an LLM evaluator.

| **[Does RAG Really Perform Bad For Long-Context Processing?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11444v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The efficient processing of long context poses a serious challenge for large language models (LLMs). Recently, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising strategy for this problem, as it enables LLMs to make selective use of the long context for efficient computation. However, existing RAG approaches lag behind other long-context processing methods due to inherent limitations on inaccurate retrieval and fragmented contexts. To address these challenges, we introduce RetroLM, a novel RAG framework for long-context processing. Unlike traditional methods, RetroLM employs KV-level retrieval augmentation, where it partitions the LLM's KV cache into contiguous pages and retrieves the most crucial ones for efficient computation. This approach enhances robustness to retrieval inaccuracy, facilitates effective utilization of fragmented contexts, and saves the cost from repeated computation. Building on this framework, we further develop a specialized retriever for precise retrieval of critical pages and conduct unsupervised post-training to optimize the model's ability to leverage retrieved information. We conduct comprehensive evaluations with a variety of benchmarks, including LongBench, InfiniteBench, and RULER, where RetroLM significantly outperforms existing long-context LLMs and efficient long-context processing methods, particularly in tasks requiring intensive reasoning or extremely long-context comprehension.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revisiting Robust RAG: Do We Still Need Complex Robust Training in the Era of Powerful LLMs?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11400v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems often suffer from performance degradation when encountering noisy or irrelevant documents, driving researchers to develop sophisticated training strategies to enhance their robustness against such retrieval noise. However, as large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, the necessity of these complex training methods is increasingly questioned. In this paper, we systematically investigate whether complex robust training strategies remain necessary as model capacity grows. Through comprehensive experiments spanning multiple model architectures and parameter scales, we evaluate various document selection methods and adversarial training techniques across diverse datasets. Our extensive experiments consistently demonstrate that as models become more powerful, the performance gains brought by complex robust training methods drop off dramatically. We delve into the rationale and find that more powerful models inherently exhibit superior confidence calibration, better generalization across datasets (even when trained with randomly selected documents), and optimal attention mechanisms learned with simpler strategies. Our findings suggest that RAG systems can benefit from simpler architectures and training strategies as models become more powerful, enabling more scalable applications with minimal complexity.</p></details> |  |
| **[FunnelRAG: A Coarse-to-Fine Progressive Retrieval Paradigm for RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10293v3)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) prevails in Large Language Models. It mainly consists of retrieval and generation. The retrieval modules (a.k.a. retrievers) aim to find useful information used to facilitate the generation modules (a.k.a. generators). As such, generators' performance largely depends on the effectiveness and efficiency of retrievers. However, the widely used retrieval paradigm remains flat. It treats retrieval procedures as a one-off deal with constant granularity. Despite effectiveness, we argue that they suffer from two limitations: (1) flat retrieval exerts a significant burden on one retriever; (2) constant granularity limits the ceiling of retrieval performance. In this work, we propose a progressive retrieval paradigm with coarse-to-fine granularity for RAG, termed FunnelRAG, so as to balance effectiveness and efficiency. Specifically, FunnelRAG establishes a progressive retrieval pipeline by collaborating coarse-to-fine granularity, large-to-small quantity, and low-to-high capacity, which can relieve the burden on one retriever and also promote the ceiling of retrieval performance. Extensive experiments manifest that FunnelRAG achieves comparable retrieval performance while the time overhead is reduced by nearly 40 percent.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 6 figures, 13 tables.

For structured data, such as knowledge graphs, GraphRAG has been widely used to retrieve relevant information. However, recent studies have revealed that structuring implicit knowledge from text into graphs can benefit certain tasks, extending the application of GraphRAG from graph data to general text-based data. Despite their successful extensions, most applications of GraphRAG for text data have been designed for specific tasks and datasets, lacking a systematic evaluation and comparison between RAG and GraphRAG on widely used text-based benchmarks. In this paper, we systematically evaluate RAG and GraphRAG on well-established benchmark tasks, such as Question Answering and Query-based Summarization. Our results highlight the distinct strengths of RAG and GraphRAG across different tasks and evaluation perspectives. Inspired by these observations, we investigate strategies to integrate their strengths to improve downstream tasks. Additionally, we provide an in-depth discussion of the shortcomings of current GraphRAG approaches and outline directions for future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Investigating Language Preference of Multilingual RAG Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11175v1)** | 2025-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multilingual Retrieval-Augmented Generation (mRAG) systems enhance language models by integrating external multilingual information to produce context-aware responses. However, mRAG systems struggle with retrieving relevant information due to linguistic variations between queries and documents, generating inconsistent responses when multilingual sources conflict. In this work, we systematically investigate language preferences in both retrieval and generation of mRAG through a series of experiments. Our analysis indicates that retrievers tend to prefer high-resource and query languages, yet this preference does not consistently improve generation performance. Moreover, we observe that generators prefer the query language or Latin scripts, leading to inconsistent outputs. To overcome these issues, we propose Dual Knowledge Multilingual RAG (DKM-RAG), a simple yet effective framework that fuses translated multilingual passages with complementary model knowledge. Empirical results demonstrate that DKM-RAG mitigates language preference in generation and enhances performance across diverse linguistic settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 16 tables, 14 figures</p></details> |

These two capabilities are complementary to each other and essential for LLMs to process large volumes of information that cannot fit into a single prompt. We present a detailed continued training recipe to extend the context window of Llama3-70B-base from 8K to 128K tokens, along with a three-stage instruction tuning process to enhance the model's instruction-following, RAG performance, and long-context understanding capabilities. Our results demonstrate that the Llama3-ChatQA-2-70B model outperforms most existing state-of-the-art models, including GPT-4-Turbo-2024-04-09, Qwen2-72B-Instruct, and Llama3.1-70B-Instruct, on ultra-long tasks beyond 100K tokens, as well as on the RAG benchmark using only a 4K context window, showing the strong long context capability across varying sequence lengths. We further provide extensive comparisons between direct long-context and RAG solutions using the same state-of-the-art long-context LLMs. Interestingly, we find that the performance of strong long-context LLMs using RAG improves when retrieving a larger number of chunks. With a large set of top-k chunks, RAG consistently outperforms direct long-context solution using the same state-of-the-art long-context models (e.g., Llama3-ChatQA-2-70B and Qwen2-72B-Instruct) on both 32K and 128K benchmarks.

| **[Hallucinations and Truth: A Comprehensive Accuracy Evaluation of RAG, LoRA and DoRA](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10497v1)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Generative AI have significantly improved the efficiency and adaptability of natural language processing (NLP) systems, particularly through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), and Weight-Decomposed Low-Rank Adaptation (DoRA). RAG integrates external knowledge to enhance factual consistency in generative outputs, while LoRA enables parameter-efficient fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs). DoRA further refines this process by optimizing fine-tuning through adaptive parameter ranking and domain-aware weight adjustments, improving learning efficiency while maintaining inference performance. This paper presents a large-scale empirical evaluation of RAG, LoRA, and DoRA, with model fine-tuning and generation performance assessed on 20,000 FAQ-based queries, while the knowledge base spans 400,000 entries. The study analyzes key performance metrics such as accuracy, relevance, and inference latency. Experimental results demonstrate that DoRA achieves the highest accuracy (90.1%), relevance score (0.88), and lowest latency (110 ms per query), outperforming both LoRA and RAG in real-world, domain-specific generative AI applications. Furthermore, this study examines the trade-offs between fine-tuning efficiency, computational cost, and real-time adaptability across different models. Findings highlight RAG's effectiveness in knowledge grounding, LoRA's cost-efficient domain adaptation, and DoRA's ability to balance fine-tuning efficiency with model precision. These insights provide practical guidance for deploying AI-driven generative systems in accuracy-critical domains such as healthcare, finance, and legal services, ensuring scalability, reliability, and optimal performance in dynamic environments.</p></details> | 10 Pages |
| **[EACO-RAG: Towards Distributed Tiered LLM Deployment using Edge-Assisted and Collaborative RAG with Adaptive Knowledge Update](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20299v2)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in language tasks, but they require high computing power and rely on static knowledge. To overcome these limitations, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) incorporates up-to-date external information into LLMs without extensive fine-tuning. Meanwhile, small language models (SLMs) deployed on edge devices offer efficiency and low latency but often struggle with complex reasoning tasks. Unfortunately, current RAG approaches are predominantly based on centralized databases and have not been adapted to address the distinct constraints associated with deploying SLMs in edge environments. To bridge this gap, we propose Edge-Assisted and Collaborative RAG (EACO-RAG), a lightweight framework that leverages distributed edge nodes for adaptive knowledge updates and retrieval. EACO-RAG also employs a hierarchical collaborative gating mechanism to dynamically select among local, edge-assisted, and cloud-based strategies, with a carefully designed algorithm based on Safe Online Bayesian Optimization to maximize the potential performance enhancements. Experimental results demonstrate that EACO-RAG matches the accuracy of cloud-based knowledge graph RAG systems while reducing total costs by up to 84.6% under relaxed delay constraints and by 65.3% under stricter delay requirements. This work represents our initial effort toward achieving a distributed and scalable tiered LLM deployments, with EACO-RAG serving as a promising first step in unlocking the full potential of hybrid edge-cloud intelligence.</p></details> |  |
| **[KET-RAG: A Cost-Efficient Multi-Granular Indexing Framework for Graph-RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09304v1)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph-RAG constructs a knowledge graph from text chunks to improve retrieval in Large Language Model (LLM)-based question answering. It is particularly useful in domains such as biomedicine, law, and political science, where retrieval often requires multi-hop reasoning over proprietary documents. Some existing Graph-RAG systems construct KNN graphs based on text chunk relevance, but this coarse-grained approach fails to capture entity relationships within texts, leading to sub-par retrieval and generation quality. To address this, recent solutions leverage LLMs to extract entities and relationships from text chunks, constructing triplet-based knowledge graphs. However, this approach incurs significant indexing costs, especially for large document collections. To ensure a good result accuracy while reducing the indexing cost, we propose KET-RAG, a multi-granular indexing framework. KET-RAG first identifies a small set of key text chunks and leverages an LLM to construct a knowledge graph skeleton. It then builds a text-keyword bipartite graph from all text chunks, serving as a lightweight alternative to a full knowledge graph. During retrieval, KET-RAG searches both structures: it follows the local search strategy of existing Graph-RAG systems on the skeleton while mimicking this search on the bipartite graph to improve retrieval quality. We evaluate eight solutions on two real-world datasets, demonstrating that KET-RAG outperforms all competitors in indexing cost, retrieval effectiveness, and generation quality. Notably, it achieves comparable or superior retrieval quality to Microsoft's Graph-RAG while reducing indexing costs by over an order of magnitude. Additionally, it improves the generation quality by up to 32.4% while lowering indexing costs by around 20%.</p></details> |  |

However, RAG still struggles to fully prevent hallucinated responses. To address this, it is essential to identify samples prone to hallucination or guide LLMs toward correct responses, which experts then annotate to develop high-quality datasets for refining LLMs. However, the growing scarcity of such datasets makes their creation challenging. This paper proposes using the vast amount of conversations from widespread LLM usage to build these datasets, training LLMs to avoid hallucination-prone questions while accurately responding to manageable ones. Given the impracticality of expert-annotating all conversation records, the paper introduces AL4RAG, which uses active learning to select the most suitable conversation samples for annotation, optimizing performance within an annotation budget. Additionally, recognizing that traditional active learning methods are not fully compatible with RAG due to unsuitable distance metrics, we develop a novel sample distance measurement for RAG active learning. Extensive experiments show that our method consistently outperforms baselines across multiple metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diversity Enhances an LLM's Performance in RAG and Long-context Task](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09017v1)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have highlighted the challenge of context window limitations, primarily due to the quadratic time complexity of the self-attention mechanism (\(O(N^2)\), where \(N\) denotes the context window length). This constraint impacts tasks such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) in question answering (Q\&A) and long context summarization. A common approach involves selecting content with the highest similarity to the query; however, this often leads to redundancy and the exclusion of diverse yet relevant information. Building on principles from Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) and Farthest Point Sampling (FPS), we integrate diversity into the content selection process. Our findings reveal that incorporating diversity substantially increases the recall of selecting relevant sentences or chunks before LLM-based Q\&A and summarization. These results highlight the importance of maintaining diversity in future LLM applications to further improve summarization and Q\&A outcomes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Better RAG using Relevant Information Gain](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12101v2)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A common way to extend the memory of large language models (LLMs) is by retrieval augmented generation (RAG), which inserts text retrieved from a larger memory into an LLM's context window. However, the context window is typically limited to several thousand tokens, which limits the number of retrieved passages that can inform a model's response. For this reason, it's important to avoid occupying context window space with redundant information by ensuring a degree of diversity among retrieved passages. At the same time, the information should also be relevant to the current task. Most prior methods that encourage diversity among retrieved results, such as Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR), do so by incorporating an objective that explicitly trades off diversity and relevance. We propose a novel simple optimization metric based on relevant information gain, a probabilistic measure of the total information relevant to a query for a set of retrieved results. By optimizing this metric, diversity organically emerges from our system. When used as a drop-in replacement for the retrieval component of a RAG system, this method yields state-of-the-art performance on question answering tasks from the Retrieval Augmented Generation Benchmark (RGB), outperforming existing metrics that directly optimize for relevance and diversity.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 page paper submitted to EMNLP</p></details> |

However, current implementations face two critical challenges: maintaining factual accuracy and delivering coherent, context-aware instruction. While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) partially addresses these issues, its reliance on pure semantic similarity limits its effectiveness in educational contexts where conceptual relationships are crucial. This paper introduces Knowledge Graph-enhanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (KG-RAG), a novel framework that integrates structured knowledge representation with context-aware retrieval to enable more effective AI tutoring. We present three key contributions: (1) a novel architecture that grounds AI responses in structured domain knowledge, (2) empirical validation through controlled experiments (n=76) demonstrating significant learning improvements (35% increase in assessment scores, p<0.001), and (3) a comprehensive implementation framework addressing practical deployment considerations.

| **[A RAG Approach for Generating Competency Questions in Ontology Engineering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08820v2)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Competency question (CQ) formulation is central to several ontology development and evaluation methodologies. Traditionally, the task of crafting these competency questions heavily relies on the effort of domain experts and knowledge engineers which is often time-consuming and labor-intensive. With the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs), there arises the possibility to automate and enhance this process. Unlike other similar works which use existing ontologies or knowledge graphs as input to LLMs, we present a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approach that uses LLMs for the automatic generation of CQs given a set of scientific papers considered to be a domain knowledge base. We investigate its performance and specifically, we study the impact of different number of papers to the RAG and different temperature setting of the LLM. We conduct experiments using GPT-4 on two domain ontology engineering tasks and compare results against ground-truth CQs constructed by domain experts. Empirical assessments on the results, utilizing evaluation metrics (precision and consistency), reveal that compared to zero-shot prompting, adding relevant domain knowledge to the RAG improves the performance of LLMs on generating CQs for concrete ontology engineering tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, traditional RAG-based tool retrieval fails to capture structured dependencies between tools, limiting the retrieval accuracy of a retrieved tool's dependencies. For example, among a vector database of tools, a "get stock price" API requires a "stock ticker" parameter from a "get stock ticker" API, and both depend on OS-level internet connectivity tools. In this paper, we address this limitation by introducing Graph RAG-Tool Fusion, a novel plug-and-play approach that combines the strengths of vector-based retrieval with efficient graph traversal to capture all relevant tools (nodes) along with any nested dependencies (edges) within the predefined tool knowledge graph. We also present ToolLinkOS, a new tool selection benchmark of 573 fictional tools, spanning over 15 industries, each with an average of 6.3 tool dependencies. We demonstrate that Graph RAG-Tool Fusion achieves absolute improvements of 71.7% and 22.1% over na\"ive RAG on ToolLinkOS and ToolSandbox benchmarks, respectively (mAP@10).

While language models show promise in this context, their probabilistic nature complicates truthfulness and comprehensibility. This paper examines state-of-the-art Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enhanced with alignment techniques to fulfill GDPR obligations. We evaluate RAG systems incorporating an alignment module like Rewindable Auto-regressive Inference (RAIN) and our proposed multidimensional extension, MultiRAIN, using a Privacy Q&A dataset. Responses are optimized for preciseness and comprehensibility and are assessed through 21 metrics, including deterministic and large language model-based evaluations. Our results show that RAG systems with an alignment module outperform baseline RAG systems on most metrics, though none fully match human answers. Principal component analysis of the results reveals complex interactions between metrics, highlighting the need to refine metrics. This study provides a foundation for integrating advanced natural language processing systems into legal compliance frameworks.</p></details> | Submitted to ARR |

Currently, the most popular methods in literature consists of fine-tuning the model on written mathematical content such as academic publications and textbooks, so that the model can learn to emulate the style of mathematical writing. In this project, we explore the effectiveness of using retrieval augmented generation (RAG) to address gaps in the mathematical reasoning of LLMs. We develop LemmaHead, a RAG knowledge base that supplements queries to the model with relevant mathematical context, with particular focus on context from published textbooks. To measure our model's performance in mathematical reasoning, our testing paradigm focuses on the task of automated theorem proving via generating proofs to a given mathematical claim in the Lean formal language.</p></details> |  |

Through systematic empirical evaluation of three different LLM variants across multiple parameter configurations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our testing methodology in assessing both functional correctness and extra-functional properties. Our framework implements 17 distinct metrics that encompass syntactic analysis, semantic evaluation, and behavioral evaluation through LLM judges. The study reveals significant information about how different architectural choices and parameter configurations affect system performance, particularly highlighting the impact of temperature and top-p parameters on response quality. The tests were carried out on a tourism recommendation system for the V\"armland region, utilizing standard and RAG-enhanced configurations. The results indicate that the newer LLM versions show modest improvements in performance metrics, though the differences are more pronounced in response length and complexity rather than in semantic quality. The research contributes practical insights for implementing robust testing practices in LLM-RAG systems, providing valuable guidance to organizations deploying these architectures in production environments.</p></details> | 10 pages |

Typically, such RAG systems retrieve search results, download HTML sources of the results, and then extract plain texts from the HTML sources. Plain text documents or chunks are fed into the LLMs to augment the generation. However, much of the structural and semantic information inherent in HTML, such as headings and table structures, is lost during this plain-text-based RAG process. To alleviate this problem, we propose HtmlRAG, which uses HTML instead of plain text as the format of retrieved knowledge in RAG. We believe HTML is better than plain text in modeling knowledge in external documents, and most LLMs possess robust capacities to understand HTML. However, utilizing HTML presents new challenges. HTML contains additional content such as tags, JavaScript, and CSS specifications, which bring extra input tokens and noise to the RAG system. To address this issue, we propose HTML cleaning, compression, and a two-step block-tree-based pruning strategy, to shorten the HTML while minimizing the loss of information. Experiments on six QA datasets confirm the superiority of using HTML in RAG systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by WWW 2025 main conference.

To this aim, this paper introduces a solution driven by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which leverages the capabilities of generative Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance the retrieval of health-related documents grounded in scientific evidence. In particular, we propose a three-stage model: in the first stage, the user's query is employed to retrieve topically relevant passages with associated references from a knowledge base constituted by scientific literature. In the second stage, these passages, alongside the initial query, are processed by LLMs to generate a contextually relevant rich text (GenText). In the last stage, the documents to be retrieved are evaluated and ranked both from the point of view of topical relevance and factual accuracy by means of their comparison with GenText, either through stance detection or semantic similarity. In addition to calculating factual accuracy, GenText can offer a layer of explainability for it, aiding users in understanding the reasoning behind the retrieval. Experimental evaluation of our model on benchmark datasets and against baseline models demonstrates its effectiveness in enhancing the retrieval of both topically relevant and factually accurate health information, thus presenting a significant step forward in the health misinformation mitigation problem.</p></details> |  |

While existing approaches such as ReAct maintain reasoning chains within the language model's context window, we observe that this often leads to plan fragmentation and execution failures. Our key insight is that by isolating the reasoning plan as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) outside the LM's working memory, we can enable (1) systematic exploration of reasoning paths, (2) atomic subqueries enabling precise retrievals and grounding, and (3) efficiency through parallel execution and bounded context window utilization. Moreover, Plan*RAG's modular design allows it to be integrated with existing RAG methods, thus providing a practical solution to improve current RAG systems. On standard multi-hop reasoning benchmarks, Plan*RAG consistently achieves improvements over recently proposed methods such as RQ-RAG and Self-RAG, while maintaining comparable computational costs.</p></details> | 19 pages, preprint |

However, their reliance on static training data limits their ability to respond to dynamic, real time queries, resulting in outdated or inaccurate outputs. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a solution, enhancing LLMs by integrating real time data retrieval to provide contextually relevant and up-to-date responses. Despite its promise, traditional RAG systems are constrained by static workflows and lack the adaptability required for multistep reasoning and complex task management. Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Agentic RAG) transcends these limitations by embedding autonomous AI agents into the RAG pipeline. These agents leverage agentic design patterns reflection, planning, tool use, and multiagent collaboration to dynamically manage retrieval strategies, iteratively refine contextual understanding, and adapt workflows to meet complex task requirements. This integration enables Agentic RAG systems to deliver unparalleled flexibility, scalability, and context awareness across diverse applications. This survey provides a comprehensive exploration of Agentic RAG, beginning with its foundational principles and the evolution of RAG paradigms. It presents a detailed taxonomy of Agentic RAG architectures, highlights key applications in industries such as healthcare, finance, and education, and examines practical implementation strategies. Additionally, it addresses challenges in scaling these systems, ensuring ethical decision making, and optimizing performance for real-world applications, while providing detailed insights into frameworks and tools for implementing Agentic RAG.</p></details> |  |

Mitigation is achieved in a question-answering Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework while detection is obtained by introducing the Negative Missing Information Scoring System (NMISS), which accounts for contextual relevance in responses. While RAG mitigates hallucinations by grounding answers in external data, NMISS refines the evaluation by identifying cases where traditional metrics incorrectly flag contextually accurate responses as hallucinations. I use Italian health news articles as context to evaluate LLM performance. Results show that Gemma2 and GPT-4 outperform the other models, with GPT-4 producing answers closely aligned with reference responses. Mid-tier models, such as Llama2, Llama3, and Mistral benefit significantly from NMISS, highlighting their ability to provide richer contextual information. This combined approach offers new insights into the reduction and more accurate assessment of hallucinations in LLMs, with applications in real-world healthcare tasks and other domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging LLM Agents for Automated Optimization Modeling for SASP Problems: A Graph-RAG based Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18320v1)** | 2025-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated optimization modeling (AOM) has evoked considerable interest with the rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs). Existing approaches predominantly rely on prompt engineering, utilizing meticulously designed expert response chains or structured guidance. However, prompt-based techniques have failed to perform well in the sensor array signal processing (SASP) area due the lack of specific domain knowledge. To address this issue, we propose an automated modeling approach based on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) technique, which consists of two principal components: a multi-agent (MA) structure and a graph-based RAG (Graph-RAG) process. The MA structure is tailored for the architectural AOM process, with each agent being designed based on principles of human modeling procedure. The Graph-RAG process serves to match user query with specific SASP modeling knowledge, thereby enhancing the modeling result. Results on ten classical signal processing problems demonstrate that the proposed approach (termed as MAG-RAG) outperforms several AOM benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

Concepts such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and other advanced techniques have been developed to enhance these systems by integrating specific university data, enabling LLMs to provide informed responses on admissions and academic counseling. However, these enhanced RAG techniques often involve high operational costs and require the training of complex, specialized modules, which poses challenges for practical deployment. Additionally, in the educational context, it is crucial to provide accurate answers to prevent misinformation, a task that LLM-based systems find challenging without appropriate strategies and methods. In this paper, we introduce the Unified RAG (URAG) Framework, a hybrid approach that significantly improves the accuracy of responses, particularly for critical queries. Experimental results demonstrate that URAG enhances our in-house, lightweight model to perform comparably to state-of-the-art commercial models. Moreover, to validate its practical applicability, we conducted a case study at our educational institution, which received positive feedback and acclaim. This study not only proves the effectiveness of URAG but also highlights its feasibility for real-world implementation in educational settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review at SoICT'24</p></details> |

However, current benchmarks for evaluating RAG systems suffer from two key deficiencies: (1) they fail to adequately measure LLMs' capability in handling long-context retrieval due to a lack of datasets that reflect the characteristics of retrieved documents, and (2) they lack a comprehensive evaluation method for assessing LLMs' ability to generate long-form responses that effectively exploits retrieved information. To address these shortcomings, we introduce the Long$^2$RAG benchmark and the Key Point Recall (KPR) metric. Long$^2$RAG comprises 280 questions spanning 10 domains and across 8 question categories, each associated with 5 retrieved documents with an average length of 2,444 words. KPR evaluates the extent to which LLMs incorporate key points extracted from the retrieved documents into their generated responses, providing a more nuanced assessment of their ability to exploit retrieved information.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP'24 (Findings).

While it empowers individuals it also enables malicious actors to perpetrate scams such as fraudulent phone calls and user impersonations. This growing threat necessitates a robust system to protect individuals In this paper we introduce a novel real time fraud detection mechanism using Retrieval Augmented Generation technology to address this challenge on two fronts. First our system incorporates a continuously updating policy checking feature that transcribes phone calls in real time and uses RAG based models to verify that the caller is not soliciting private information thus ensuring transparency and the authenticity of the conversation. Second we implement a real time user impersonation check with a two step verification process to confirm the callers identity ensuring accountability. A key innovation of our system is the ability to update policies without retraining the entire model enhancing its adaptability. We validated our RAG based approach using synthetic call recordings achieving an accuracy of 97.98 percent and an F1score of 97.44 percent with 100 calls outperforming state of the art methods. This robust and flexible fraud detection system is well suited for real world deployment.</p></details> |  |

Web search is frequently adopted as grounding for agent knowledge, yet an improper configuration affects the quality of the agent's responses. Here, we assess the agent behavior using distinct date-controlled tools (DCTs) as stress test to measure the knowledge variability of large language model (LLM) agents. We demonstrate the temporal effects of an LLM agent as a writing assistant, which uses web search to complete scientific publication abstracts. We show that the temporality of search engine translates into tool-dependent agent performance but can be alleviated with base model choice and explicit reasoning instructions such as chain-of-thought prompting. Our results indicate that agent design and evaluations should take a dynamical view and implement measures to account for the temporal influence of external resources to ensure reliability.</p></details> | <details><summary>under...</summary><p>under review, comments welcome</p></details> |

We focus on a dynamic network bridging task, where agents must learn to maintain a communication path between two moving targets. To ensure safety during training and deployment, we integrate a control-theoretic safety filter that enforces collision avoidance through local setpoint updates. We develop and evaluate multi-agent reinforcement learning safety-informed message passing, showing that encoding safety filter activations as edge-level features improves coordination. The results suggest that local safety enforcement and decentralized learning can be effectively combined in distributed multi-agent tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 18 equations, 4 figures, 1 algorithm, and 1 table</p></details> |
| **[Sequential Binary Hypothesis Testing with Competing Agents under Information Asymmetry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02743v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper concerns sequential hypothesis testing in competitive multi-agent systems where agents exchange potentially manipulated information. Specifically, a two-agent scenario is studied where each agent aims to correctly infer the true state of nature while optimizing decision speed and accuracy. At each iteration, agents collect private observations, update their beliefs, and share (possibly corrupted) belief signals with their counterparts before deciding whether to stop and declare a state, or continue gathering more information. The analysis yields three main results: (1)~when agents share information strategically, the optimal signaling policy involves equal-probability randomization between truthful and inverted beliefs; (2)~agents maximize performance by relying solely on their own observations for belief updating while using received information only to anticipate their counterpart's stopping decision; and (3)~the agent reaching their confidence threshold first cause the other agent to achieve a higher conditional probability of error. Numerical simulations further demonstrate that agents with higher KL divergence in their conditional distributions gain competitive advantage. Furthermore, our results establish that information sharing -- despite strategic manipulation -- reduces overall system stopping time compared to non-interactive scenarios, which highlights the inherent value of communication even in this competitive setup.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, submitted to IEEE Conference on Decision and Control 2025</p></details> |
| **[Agentic Large Language Models, a survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23037v2)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There is great interest in agentic LLMs, large language models that act as agents. We review the growing body of work in this area and provide a research agenda. Agentic LLMs are LLMs that (1) reason, (2) act, and (3) interact. We organize the literature according to these three categories. The research in the first category focuses on reasoning, reflection, and retrieval, aiming to improve decision making; the second category focuses on action models, robots, and tools, aiming for agents that act as useful assistants; the third category focuses on multi-agent systems, aiming for collaborative task solving and simulating interaction to study emergent social behavior. We find that works mutually benefit from results in other categories: retrieval enables tool use, reflection improves multi-agent collaboration, and reasoning benefits all categories. We discuss applications of agentic LLMs and provide an agenda for further research. Important applications are in medical diagnosis, logistics and financial market analysis. Meanwhile, self-reflective agents playing roles and interacting with one another augment the process of scientific research itself. Further, agentic LLMs may provide a solution for the problem of LLMs running out of training data: inference-time behavior generates new training states, such that LLMs can keep learning without needing ever larger datasets. We note that there is risk associated with LLM assistants taking action in the real world, while agentic LLMs are also likely to benefit society.</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website: https://askeplaat.github.io/agentic-llm-survey-site/</p></details> |

Users increasingly rely on LLM-based agents to solve complex missions through iterative interactions. However, existing benchmarks predominantly access agents in single-mission scenarios, failing to capture real-world complexity. To bridge this gap, we propose the Multi-Mission Tool Bench. In the benchmark, each test case comprises multiple interrelated missions. This design requires agents to dynamically adapt to evolving demands. Moreover, the proposed benchmark explores all possible mission-switching patterns within a fixed mission number. Specifically, we propose a multi-agent data generation framework to construct the benchmark. We also propose a novel method to evaluate the accuracy and efficiency of agent decisions with dynamic decision trees. Experiments on diverse open-source and closed-source LLMs reveal critical factors influencing agent robustness and provide actionable insights to the tool invocation society.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning based Traffic Signal Control through Spatio-temporal Hypergraphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11014v2)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic signal control systems (TSCSs) are integral to intelligent traffic management, fostering efficient vehicle flow. Traditional approaches often simplify road networks into standard graphs, which results in a failure to consider the dynamic nature of traffic data at neighboring intersections, thereby neglecting higher-order interconnections necessary for real-time control. To address this, we propose a novel TSCS framework to realize intelligent traffic control. This framework collaborates with multiple neighboring edge computing servers to collect traffic information across the road network. To elevate the efficiency of traffic signal control, we have crafted a multi-agent soft actor-critic (MA-SAC) reinforcement learning algorithm. Within this algorithm, individual agents are deployed at each intersection with a mandate to optimize traffic flow across the road network collectively. Furthermore, we introduce hypergraph learning into the critic network of MA-SAC to enable the spatio-temporal interactions from multiple intersections in the road network. This method fuses hypergraph and spatio-temporal graph structures to encode traffic data and capture the complex spatio-temporal correlations between multiple intersections. Our empirical evaluation, tested on varied datasets, demonstrates the superiority of our framework in minimizing average vehicle travel times and sustaining high-throughput performance. This work facilitates the development of more intelligent urban traffic management solutions.

| **[CHARMS: Cognitive Hierarchical Agent with Reasoning and Motion Styles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02450v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To address the current challenges of low intelligence and simplistic vehicle behavior modeling in autonomous driving simulation scenarios, this paper proposes the Cognitive Hierarchical Agent with Reasoning and Motion Styles (CHARMS). The model can reason about the behavior of other vehicles like a human driver and respond with different decision-making styles, thereby improving the intelligence and diversity of the surrounding vehicles in the driving scenario. By introducing the Level-k behavioral game theory, the paper models the decision-making process of human drivers and employs deep reinforcement learning to train the models with diverse decision styles, simulating different reasoning approaches and behavioral characteristics. Building on the Poisson cognitive hierarchy theory, this paper also presents a novel driving scenario generation method. The method controls the proportion of vehicles with different driving styles in the scenario using Poisson and binomial distributions, thus generating controllable and diverse driving environments. Experimental results demonstrate that CHARMS not only exhibits superior decision-making capabilities as ego vehicles, but also generates more complex and diverse driving scenarios as surrounding vehicles. We will release code for CHARMS at https://github.com/WUTAD-Wjy/CHARMS.</p></details> |  |

The advent of modern computers and supercomputers has enabled these bottom-up approaches to realistically model human mobility and contact behavior. The COVID-19 pandemic showcased the urgent need for detailed and informative models that can answer research questions on transmission dynamics. We present a sophisticated agent-based model to simulate the spread of respiratory diseases. The model is highly modularized and can be used on various scales, from a small collection of buildings up to cities or countries. Although not being the focus of this paper, the model has undergone performance engineering on a single core and provides an efficient intra- and inter-simulation parallelization for time-critical decision-making processes. In order to allow answering research questions on individual level resolution, nonpharmaceutical intervention strategies such as face masks or venue closures can be implemented for particular locations or agents. In particular, we allow for sophisticated testing and isolation strategies to study the effects of minimal-invasive infectious disease mitigation. With realistic human mobility patterns for the region of Brunswick, Germany, we study the effects of different interventions between March 1st and May 30, 2021 in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Our analyses suggest that symptom-independent testing has limited impact on the mitigation of disease dynamics if the dark figure in symptomatic cases is high. Furthermore, we found that quarantine length is more important than quarantine efficiency but that, with sufficient symptomatic control, also short quarantines can have a substantial effect.</p></details> | <details><summary>40 pa...</summary><p>40 pages, 18 figures, submitted to Elsevier</p></details> |
| **[Unlocking LLM Repair Capabilities in Low-Resource Programming Languages Through Cross-Language Translation and Multi-Agent Refinement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22512v2)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in leveraging LLMs for APR have demonstrated impressive capabilities in fixing software defects. However, current LLM-based approaches predominantly focus on mainstream programming languages like Java and Python, neglecting less prevalent but emerging languages such as Rust due to expensive training resources, limited datasets, and insufficient community support. This narrow focus creates a significant gap in repair capabilities across the programming language spectrum, where the full potential of LLMs for comprehensive multilingual program repair remains largely unexplored. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel cross-language program repair approach LANTERN that leverages LLMs' differential proficiency across languages through a multi-agent iterative repair paradigm. Our technique strategically translates defective code from languages where LLMs exhibit weaker repair capabilities to languages where they demonstrate stronger performance, without requiring additional training. A key innovation of our approach is an LLM-based decision-making system that dynamically selects optimal target languages based on bug characteristics and continuously incorporates feedback from previous repair attempts. We evaluate our method on xCodeEval, a comprehensive multilingual benchmark comprising 5,068 bugs across 11 programming languages. Results demonstrate significant enhancement in repair effectiveness, particularly for underrepresented languages, with Rust showing a 22.09% improvement in Pass@10 metrics. Our research provides the first empirical evidence that cross-language translation significantly expands the repair capabilities of LLMs and effectively bridges the performance gap between programming languages with different levels of popularity, opening new avenues for truly language-agnostic automated program repair.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we investigate how an LLM, acting as an autonomous agent, leverages semantic ambiguity to generate deceptive puzzles that mislead and challenge human users. Inspired by the popular puzzle game "Connections", we systematically compare puzzles produced through zero-shot prompting, role-injected adversarial prompts, and human-crafted examples, with an emphasis on understanding the underlying agent decision-making processes. Employing computational analyses with HateBERT to quantify semantic ambiguity, alongside subjective human evaluations, we demonstrate that explicit adversarial agent behaviors significantly heighten semantic ambiguity -- thereby increasing cognitive load and reducing fairness in puzzle solving. These findings provide critical insights into the emergent agentic qualities of LLMs and underscore important ethical considerations for evaluating and safely deploying autonomous language systems in both educational technologies and entertainment.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

A Case Study in Online Learning and Games](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16843v4)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly employed for (interactive) decision-making, via the development of LLM-based autonomous agents. Despite their emerging successes, the performance of LLM agents in decision-making has not been fully investigated through quantitative metrics, especially in the multi-agent setting when they interact with each other, a typical scenario in real-world LLM-agent applications. To better understand the limits of LLM agents in these interactive environments, we propose to study their interactions in benchmark decision-making settings in online learning and game theory, through the performance metric of \emph{regret}. We first empirically study the {no-regret} behaviors of LLMs in canonical (non-stationary) online learning problems, as well as the emergence of equilibria when LLM agents interact through playing repeated games. We then provide some theoretical insights into the no-regret behaviors of LLM agents, under certain assumptions on the supervised pre-training and the rationality model of human decision-makers who generate the data. Notably, we also identify (simple) cases where advanced LLMs such as GPT-4 fail to be no-regret. To promote the no-regret behaviors, we propose a novel \emph{unsupervised} training loss of \emph{regret-loss}, which, in contrast to the supervised pre-training loss, does not require the labels of (optimal) actions. We then establish the statistical guarantee of generalization bound for regret-loss minimization, followed by the optimization guarantee that minimizing such a loss may automatically lead to known no-regret learning algorithms. Our further experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our regret-loss, especially in addressing the above ``regrettable'' cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>Camer...</summary><p>Camera ready version of ICLR 2025</p></details> |

However, these approaches struggle with adaptability for decision-making where the opinions of each matter rather than reaching an agreement based on honest majority or weighted consensus. This paper introduces a novel deliberation-based consensus mechanism where Large Language Models (LLMs) act as rational agents engaging in structured discussions to reach a unanimous consensus. By leveraging graded consensus and a multi-round deliberation process, our approach ensures both unanimous consensus for definitive problems and graded confidence for prioritized decisions and policies. We provide a formalization of our system and use it to show that the properties of blockchains: consistency, agreement, liveness, and determinism are maintained. Moreover, experimental results demonstrate our system's feasibility, showcasing how our deliberation method's convergence, block properties, and accuracy enable decision-making on blockchain networks. We also address key challenges with this novel approach such as degeneration of thoughts, hallucinations, malicious models and nodes, resource consumption, and scalability.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 9 figure, 3 tables</p></details> |

This paper explores how LLMs can effectively allocate computational tasks among multiple agents, considering factors such as cost, efficiency, and performance. In this work, we address key questions, including the effectiveness of LLMs as orchestrators and planners, comparing their effectiveness in task assignment and coordination. Our experiments demonstrate that LLMs can achieve high validity and accuracy in resource allocation tasks. We find that the planner method outperforms the orchestrator method in handling concurrent actions, resulting in improved efficiency and better utilization of agents. Additionally, we show that providing explicit information about worker capabilities enhances the allocation strategies of planners, particularly when dealing with suboptimal workers.</p></details> |  |
| **[Distributed Multi-agent Coordination over Cellular Sheaves](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02049v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Techniques for coordination of multi-agent systems are vast and varied, often utilizing purpose-built solvers or controllers with tight coupling to the types of systems involved or the coordination goal. In this paper, we introduce a general unified framework for heterogeneous multi-agent coordination using the language of cellular sheaves and nonlinear sheaf Laplacians, which are generalizations of graphs and graph Laplacians. Specifically, we introduce the concept of a nonlinear homological program encompassing a choice of cellular sheaf on an undirected graph, nonlinear edge potential functions, and constrained convex node objectives. We use the alternating direction method of multipliers to derive a distributed optimization algorithm for solving these nonlinear homological programs. To demonstrate the wide applicability of this framework, we show how hybrid coordination goals including combinations of consensus, formation, and flocking can be formulated as nonlinear homological programs and provide numerical simulations showing the efficacy of our distributed solution algorithm.</p></details> |  |
| **[Review, Refine, Repeat: Understanding Iterative Decoding of AI Agents with Dynamic Evaluation and Selection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01931v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While AI agents have shown remarkable performance at various tasks, they still struggle with complex multi-modal applications, structured generation and strategic planning. Improvements via standard fine-tuning is often impractical, as solving agentic tasks usually relies on black box API access without control over model parameters. Inference-time methods such as Best-of-N (BON) sampling offer a simple yet effective alternative to improve performance. However, BON lacks iterative feedback integration mechanism. Hence, we propose Iterative Agent Decoding (IAD) which combines iterative refinement with dynamic candidate evaluation and selection guided by a verifier. IAD differs in how feedback is designed and integrated, specifically optimized to extract maximal signal from reward scores. We conduct a detailed comparison of baselines across key metrics on Sketch2Code, Text2SQL, and Webshop where IAD consistently outperforms baselines, achieving 3--6% absolute gains on Sketch2Code and Text2SQL (with and without LLM judges) and 8--10% gains on Webshop across multiple metrics. To better understand the source of IAD's gains, we perform controlled experiments to disentangle the effect of adaptive feedback from stochastic sampling, and find that IAD's improvements are primarily driven by verifier-guided refinement, not merely sampling diversity. We also show that both IAD and BON exhibit inference-time scaling with increased compute when guided by an optimal verifier. Our analysis highlights the critical role of verifier quality in effective inference-time optimization and examines the impact of noisy and sparse rewards on scaling behavior. Together, these findings offer key insights into the trade-offs and principles of effective inference-time optimization.</p></details> |  |

A Case Study on Vaccine Hesitancy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09639v3)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Can we simulate a sandbox society with generative agents to model human behavior, thereby reducing the over-reliance on real human trials for assessing public policies? In this work, we investigate the feasibility of simulating health-related decision-making, using vaccine hesitancy, defined as the delay in acceptance or refusal of vaccines despite the availability of vaccination services (MacDonald, 2015), as a case study. To this end, we introduce the VacSim framework with 100 generative agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). VacSim simulates vaccine policy outcomes with the following steps: 1) instantiate a population of agents with demographics based on census data; 2) connect the agents via a social network and model vaccine attitudes as a function of social dynamics and disease-related information; 3) design and evaluate various public health interventions aimed at mitigating vaccine hesitancy. To align with real-world results, we also introduce simulation warmup and attitude modulation to adjust agents' attitudes. We propose a series of evaluations to assess the reliability of various LLM simulations. Experiments indicate that models like Llama and Qwen can simulate aspects of human behavior but also highlight real-world alignment challenges, such as inconsistent responses with demographic profiles. This early exploration of LLM-driven simulations is not meant to serve as definitive policy guidance; instead, it serves as a call for action to examine social simulation for policy development.</p></details> |  |

This paper proposes a novel framework called USER-LLM R1 for a user-aware conversational agent that addresses this challenge through dynamic user profiling and model initiation. Our approach integrates chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning models to iteratively infer user preferences and vision-language models (VLMs) to initialize user profiles from multimodal inputs, enabling personalized interactions from the first encounter. Leveraging a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture, the system dynamically refines user representations within an inherent CoT process, ensuring contextually relevant and adaptive responses. Evaluations on the ElderlyTech-VQA Bench demonstrate significant improvements in ROUGE-1 (+23.2%), ROUGE-2 (+0.6%), and ROUGE-L (+8%) F1 scores over state-of-the-art baselines, with ablation studies underscoring the impact of reasoning model size on performance. Human evaluations further validate the framework's efficacy, particularly for elderly users, where tailored responses enhance engagement and trust. Ethical considerations, including privacy preservation and bias mitigation, are rigorously discussed and addressed to ensure responsible deployment.</p></details> |  |

We propose a method for leveraging a large language model (GPT-4o) to automatically generate networks capable of adapting to dynamic environments. The proposed method collects environmental "status," representing conditions and goals, and uses them to generate agents. These agents are interconnected on the basis of specific conditions, resulting in networks that combine flexibility and generality. We conducted evaluation experiments to compare the networks automatically generated with the proposed method with manually constructed ones, confirming the comprehensiveness of the proposed method's networks and their higher generality. This research marks a significant advancement toward the development of versatile planning methods applicable to robotics, autonomous vehicles, smart systems, and other complex environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[A$^\text{T}$A: Adaptive Transformation Agent for Text-Guided Subject-Position Variable Background Inpainting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01603v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image inpainting aims to fill the missing region of an image. Recently, there has been a surge of interest in foreground-conditioned background inpainting, a sub-task that fills the background of an image while the foreground subject and associated text prompt are provided. Existing background inpainting methods typically strictly preserve the subject's original position from the source image, resulting in inconsistencies between the subject and the generated background. To address this challenge, we propose a new task, the "Text-Guided Subject-Position Variable Background Inpainting", which aims to dynamically adjust the subject position to achieve a harmonious relationship between the subject and the inpainted background, and propose the Adaptive Transformation Agent (A$^\text{T}$A) for this task. Firstly, we design a PosAgent Block that adaptively predicts an appropriate displacement based on given features to achieve variable subject-position.

| **[Are Autonomous Web Agents Good Testers?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01495v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite advances in automated testing, manual testing remains prevalent due to the high maintenance demands associated with test script fragility-scripts often break with minor changes in application structure. Recent developments in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a potential alternative by powering Autonomous Web Agents (AWAs) that can autonomously interact with applications. These agents may serve as Autonomous Test Agents (ATAs), potentially reducing the need for maintenance-heavy automated scripts by utilising natural language instructions similar to those used by human testers. This paper investigates the feasibility of adapting AWAs for natural language test case execution and how to evaluate them. We contribute with (1) a benchmark of three offline web applications, and a suite of 113 manual test cases, split between passing and failing cases, to evaluate and compare ATAs performance, (2) SeeAct-ATA and pinATA, two open-source ATA implementations capable of executing test steps, verifying assertions and giving verdicts, and (3) comparative experiments using our benchmark that quantifies our ATAs effectiveness. Finally we also proceed to a qualitative evaluation to identify the limitations of PinATA, our best performing implementation. Our findings reveal that our simple implementation, SeeAct-ATA, does not perform well compared to our more advanced PinATA implementation when executing test cases (50% performance improvement). However, while PinATA obtains around 60% of correct verdict and up to a promising 94% specificity, we identify several limitations that need to be addressed to develop more resilient and reliable ATAs, paving the way for robust, low maintenance test automation.

Since these parameters are interrelated in complex ways, optimizing them is a black-box problem that proves especially challenging for nonexperts. Although existing optimization-as-a-service platforms (e.g., Vizier and Optuna) can handle such problems, they are impractical for RL systems, since the need for manual user mapping of each parameter to distinct components makes the effort cumbersome. It also requires understanding of the optimization process, limiting the systems' application beyond the machine learning field and restricting access in areas such as cognitive science, which models human decision-making. To tackle these challenges, the paper presents AgentForge, a flexible low-code platform to optimize any parameter set across an RL system. Available at https://github.com/feferna/AgentForge, it allows an optimization problem to be defined in a few lines of code and handed to any of the interfaced optimizers. With AgentForge, the user can optimize the parameters either individually or jointly. The paper presents an evaluation of its performance for a challenging vision-based RL problem.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted at the 17th International Conference on Agents and Artificial Intelligence (ICAART 2025)</p></details> |

Assessing the Current State of Web Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01382v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As digitalization and cloud technologies evolve, the web is becoming increasingly important in the modern society. Autonomous web agents based on large language models (LLMs) hold a great potential in work automation. It is therefore important to accurately measure and monitor the progression of their capabilities. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive and rigorous assessment of the current state of web agents. Our results depict a very different picture of the competency of current agents, suggesting over-optimism in previously reported results. This gap can be attributed to shortcomings in existing benchmarks. We introduce Online-Mind2Web, an online evaluation benchmark consisting of 300 diverse and realistic tasks spanning 136 websites. It enables us to evaluate web agents under a setting that approximates how real users use these agents. To facilitate more scalable evaluation and development, we also develop a novel LLM-as-a-Judge automatic evaluation method and show that it can achieve around 85% agreement with human judgment, substantially higher than existing methods. Finally, we present the first comprehensive comparative analysis of current web agents, highlighting both their strengths and limitations to inspire future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 16 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

However, existing studies on this topic are limited, as they primarily rely on small-scale experiments with human participants - a fundamental constraint of human subject studies. To address this limitation, we employ AI agents to simulate a large number of complex data exploration scenarios, including revisiting past states and branching into new exploration paths. This strategy enables us to accurately assess the impact of checkpointing while closely mimicking the behavior of real-world data practitioners. Our evaluation results, involving more than 1,000 exploration paths and 2,848 executed code blocks, show that a checkpointing framework for computational notebooks can indeed enhance productivity by minimizing unnecessary code re-executions and redundant variables or code.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended Abstracts of the CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, 2025, Yokohama, Japan</p></details> |
| **[Factored Agents: Decoupling In-Context Learning and Memorization for Robust Tool Use](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22931v2)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose a novel factored agent architecture designed to overcome the limitations of traditional single-agent systems in agentic AI. Our approach decomposes the agent into two specialized components: (1) a large language model (LLM) that serves as a high level planner and in-context learner, which may use dynamically available information in user prompts, (2) a smaller language model which acts as a memorizer of tool format and output. This decoupling addresses prevalent issues in monolithic designs, including malformed, missing, and hallucinated API fields, as well as suboptimal planning in dynamic environments. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our factored architecture significantly improves planning accuracy and error resilience, while elucidating the inherent trade-off between in-context learning and static memorization. These findings suggest that a factored approach is a promising pathway for developing more robust and adaptable agentic AI systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[SWE-Search: Enhancing Software Agents with Monte Carlo Tree Search and Iterative Refinement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20285v6)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software engineers operating in complex and dynamic environments must continuously adapt to evolving requirements, learn iteratively from experience, and reconsider their approaches based on new insights. However, current large language model (LLM)-based software agents often follow linear, sequential processes that prevent backtracking and exploration of alternative solutions, limiting their ability to rethink their strategies when initial approaches prove ineffective. To address these challenges, we propose SWE-Search, a multi-agent framework that integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with a self-improvement mechanism to enhance software agents' performance on repository-level software tasks. SWE-Search extends traditional MCTS by incorporating a hybrid value function that leverages LLMs for both numerical value estimation and qualitative evaluation. This enables self-feedback loops where agents iteratively refine their strategies based on both quantitative numerical evaluations and qualitative natural language assessments of pursued trajectories. The framework includes a SWE-Agent for adaptive exploration, a Value Agent for iterative feedback, and a Discriminator Agent that facilitates multi-agent debate for collaborative decision-making. Applied to the SWE-bench benchmark, our approach demonstrates a 23% relative improvement in performance across five models compared to standard open-source agents without MCTS. Our analysis reveals how performance scales with increased inference-time compute through deeper search, providing a pathway to improve software agents without requiring larger models or additional training data. This highlights the potential of self-evaluation driven search techniques in complex software engineering environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Main ...</summary><p>Main body: 10 pages, 5 figures.

| **[Grounding Multimodal LLMs to Embodied Agents that Ask for Help with Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00907v2)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied agents operating in real-world environments must interpret ambiguous and under-specified human instructions. A capable household robot should recognize ambiguity and ask relevant clarification questions to infer the user intent accurately, leading to more effective task execution. To study this problem, we introduce the Ask-to-Act task, where an embodied agent must fetch a specific object instance given an ambiguous instruction in a home environment. The agent must strategically ask minimal, yet relevant, clarification questions to resolve ambiguity while navigating under partial observability. To solve this problem, we propose a novel approach that fine-tunes multimodal large language models (MLLMs) as vision-language-action (VLA) policies using online reinforcement learning (RL) with LLM-generated rewards. Our method eliminates the need for large-scale human demonstrations or manually engineered rewards for training such agents. We benchmark against strong zero-shot baselines, including GPT-4o, and supervised fine-tuned MLLMs, on our task. Our results demonstrate that our RL-finetuned MLLM outperforms all baselines by a significant margin ($19.1$-$40.3\%$), generalizing well to novel scenes and tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of adapting MLLMs as VLA agents that can act and ask for help using LLM-generated rewards with online RL.</p></details> |  |
| **[Strategize Globally, Adapt Locally: A Multi-Turn Red Teaming Agent with Dual-Level Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01278v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The exploitation of large language models (LLMs) for malicious purposes poses significant security risks as these models become more powerful and widespread. While most existing red-teaming frameworks focus on single-turn attacks, real-world adversaries typically operate in multi-turn scenarios, iteratively probing for vulnerabilities and adapting their prompts based on threat model responses. In this paper, we propose \AlgName, a novel multi-turn red-teaming agent that emulates sophisticated human attackers through complementary learning dimensions: global tactic-wise learning that accumulates knowledge over time and generalizes to new attack goals, and local prompt-wise learning that refines implementations for specific goals when initial attempts fail. Unlike previous multi-turn approaches that rely on fixed strategy sets, \AlgName enables the agent to identify new jailbreak tactics, develop a goal-based tactic selection framework, and refine prompt formulations for selected tactics. Empirical evaluations on JailbreakBench demonstrate our framework's superior performance, achieving over 90\% attack success rates against GPT-3.5-Turbo and Llama-3.1-70B within 5 conversation turns, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. These results highlight the effectiveness of dynamic learning in identifying and exploiting model vulnerabilities in realistic multi-turn scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in this regard, leading to recent proposals for declarative frameworks for LLM-powered processing of unstructured data. However, these frameworks focus on reducing cost when executing user-specified operations using LLMs, rather than improving accuracy, executing most operations as-is (in a single LLM call). This is problematic for complex tasks and data, where LLM outputs for user-defined operations are often inaccurate, even with optimized prompts. For example, an LLM may struggle to identify {\em all} instances of specific clauses, like force majeure or indemnification, in lengthy legal documents, requiring decomposition of the data, the task, or both. We present DocETL, a system that optimizes complex document processing pipelines, while accounting for LLM shortcomings. DocETL offers a declarative interface for users to define such pipelines and uses an agent-based approach to automatically optimize them, leveraging novel agent-based rewrites (that we call rewrite directives), as well as an optimization and evaluation framework. We introduce (i) logical rewriting of pipelines, tailored for LLM-based tasks, (ii) an agent-guided plan evaluation mechanism that synthesizes and orchestrates task-specific validation prompts, and (iii) an optimization algorithm that efficiently finds promising plans, considering the latencies of agent-based plan generation and evaluation. Our evaluation on four different unstructured document analysis tasks demonstrates that DocETL finds plans with outputs that are 25 to 80% more accurate than well-engineered baselines, addressing a critical gap in unstructured data analysis. DocETL is open-source at docetl.org, and as of March 2025, has amassed over 1.7k GitHub Stars, with users spanning a variety of domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 6 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

This growing risk highlights the urgent need for a real-world benchmark to evaluate the ability of LLM agents to exploit web application vulnerabilities. However, existing benchmarks fall short as they are limited to abstracted Capture the Flag competitions or lack comprehensive coverage. Building a benchmark for real-world vulnerabilities involves both specialized expertise to reproduce exploits and a systematic approach to evaluating unpredictable threats. To address this challenge, we introduce CVE-Bench, a real-world cybersecurity benchmark based on critical-severity Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures. In CVE-Bench, we design a sandbox framework that enables LLM agents to exploit vulnerable web applications in scenarios that mimic real-world conditions, while also providing effective evaluation of their exploits. Our evaluation shows that the state-of-the-art agent framework can resolve up to 13% of vulnerabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 4 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

However, current agents face significant challenges: imprecise grounding of GUI elements, difficulties with long-horizon task planning, and performance bottlenecks from relying on single generalist models for diverse cognitive tasks. To this end, we introduce Agent S2, a novel compositional framework that delegates cognitive responsibilities across various generalist and specialist models. We propose a novel Mixture-of-Grounding technique to achieve precise GUI localization and introduce Proactive Hierarchical Planning, dynamically refining action plans at multiple temporal scales in response to evolving observations. Evaluations demonstrate that Agent S2 establishes new state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on three prominent computer use benchmarks. Specifically, Agent S2 achieves 18.9% and 32.7% relative improvements over leading baseline agents such as Claude Computer Use and UI-TARS on the OSWorld 15-step and 50-step evaluation. Moreover, Agent S2 generalizes effectively to other operating systems and applications, surpassing previous best methods by 52.8% on WindowsAgentArena and by 16.52% on AndroidWorld relatively.

Specifically, we are interested in characterizing conditions on the fleet size and the proportion of adversarial agents for which a routing policy remains stable, where stability for a routing policy is achieved if the number of outstanding requests is uniformly bounded over time. To obtain this characterization, we first establish a threshold on the proportion of adversarial agents above which previously stable routing policies for fully cooperative fleets are provably unstable. We then derive a sufficient condition on the fleet size to recover stability given a maximum proportion of adversarial agents. We empirically validate our theoretical results on a case study on autonomous taxi routing, where we consider transportation requests from real San Francisco taxicab data.</p></details> | 14 pages, 4 figures |

Real-world tasks require handling intricate interactions, advanced spatial reasoning, long-term planning, and continuous exploration of new strategies-areas in which we lack effective methodologies for comprehensively evaluating these capabilities. To address this gap, we introduce BALROG, a novel benchmark designed to assess the agentic capabilities of LLMs and VLMs through a diverse set of challenging games. Our benchmark incorporates a range of existing reinforcement learning environments with varying levels of difficulty, including tasks that are solvable by non-expert humans in seconds to extremely challenging ones that may take years to master (e.g., the NetHack Learning Environment). We devise fine-grained metrics to measure performance and conduct an extensive evaluation of several popular open-source and closed-source LLMs and VLMs. Our findings indicate that while current models achieve partial success in the easier games, they struggle significantly with more challenging tasks. Notably, we observe severe deficiencies in vision-based decision-making, as several models perform worse when visual representations of the environments are provided. We release BALROG as an open and user-friendly benchmark to facilitate future research and development in the agentic community.

A defining feature of the system is its decoupling of external sources from an internal knowledge cache that is progressively updated to guide both query generation and evidence selection. This design mitigates bias-reinforcement loops and enables dynamic, trackable search exploration paths, thereby optimizing the trade-off between exploring diverse information and maintaining accuracy through autonomous agent decision-making. Our approach is evaluated on a broad range of open-domain question answering benchmarks, including multi-step tasks that mirror real-world scenarios where integrating information from multiple sources is critical, especially given the vulnerabilities of LLMs that lack explicit reasoning or planning capabilities. The results show that the proposed system not only outperforms single-step baselines regardless of task difficulty but also, compared to conventional iterative retrieval methods, demonstrates pronounced advantages in complex tasks through precise evidence-based reasoning and enhanced efficiency. The proposed system supports both competitive and collaborative sharing of updated context, enabling multi-agent extension. The benefits of multi-agent configurations become especially prominent as task difficulty increases. The number of convergence steps scales with task difficulty, suggesting cost-effective scalability.</p></details> |  |

However, existing Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) algorithms that rely solely on reward shaping are ineffective in ensuring safety, and their scalability is rather limited due to the fixed-size network output. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework, Scalable Safe MARL (SS-MARL), to enhance the safety and scalability of MARL methods. Leveraging the inherent graph structure of MAS, we design a multi-layer message passing network to aggregate local observations and communications of varying sizes. Furthermore, we develop a constrained joint policy optimization method in the setting of local observation to improve safety. Simulation experiments demonstrate that SS-MARL achieves a better trade-off between optimality and safety compared to baselines, and its scalability significantly outperforms the latest methods in scenarios with a large number of agents.</p></details> |  |

Traditional graph data synthesis techniques primarily focus on simplistic structural operations, lacking the capacity to generate semantically rich nodes with meaningful textual attributes: a critical limitation for real-world applications. While large language models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional text generation capabilities, their direct application to graph synthesis is impeded by context window limitations, hallucination phenomena, and structural consistency challenges. To address these issues, we introduce GraphMaster, the first multi-agent framework specifically designed for graph data synthesis in data-limited environments. GraphMaster orchestrates four specialized LLM agents (Manager, Perception, Enhancement, and Evaluation) that collaboratively optimize the synthesis process through iterative refinement, ensuring both semantic coherence and structural integrity. To rigorously evaluate our approach, we create new data-limited "Sub" variants of six standard graph benchmarks, specifically designed to test synthesis capabilities under realistic constraints. Additionally, we develop a novel interpretability assessment framework that combines human evaluation with a principled Grassmannian manifold-based analysis, providing both qualitative and quantitative measures of semantic coherence. Experimental results demonstrate that GraphMaster significantly outperforms traditional synthesis methods across multiple datasets, establishing a strong foundation for advancing GFMs in data-scarce environments.</p></details> |  |

Typically, these tasks are manually completed by data scientists, making the process very labor-intensive and showing a clear need for automation. Although existing methods (e.g., Table QA or Text-to-SQL) have been proposed to reduce human dependency, they cannot handle complex analytical tasks that require multi-step reasoning, cross-table associations, and synthesizing insights into reports. Moreover, there is no dataset available for developing automatic RDB-DA report generation. To fill this gap, this paper proposes an LLM agent system for RDB-DA report generation tasks, dubbed DAgent; moreover, we construct a benchmark for automatic data analysis report generation, which includes a new dataset DA-Dataset and evaluation metrics. DAgent integrates planning, tools, and memory modules to decompose natural language questions into logically independent sub-queries, accurately retrieve key information from relational databases, and generate analytical reports that meet the requirements of completeness, correctness, and conciseness through multi-step reasoning and effective data integration. Experimental analysis on the DA-Dataset demonstrates that DAgent's superiority in retrieval performance and analysis report generation quality, showcasing its strong potential for tackling complex database analysis report generation tasks.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose a method based on 1-safe Petri nets to model Asynchronous Multi-Agent Systems (AMAS), starting from two semantics defined on AMAS represented as transition systems. Specifically, we focus on two types of synchronization: synchronization on transitions and synchronization on data. For both, we define an operator that composes 1-safe Petri nets and demonstrate the relationships between the composed Petri net and the global transition systems as defined in theliterature. Additionally, we analyze the relationships between the two semantics on Petri nets, proposing two constructions that enable switching between them. These transformations are particularly useful for system analysis, as they allow the selection of the most suitable model based on the property that needs to be verified.</p></details> |  |

Here, we adapt it to the case when the two agents have arbitrary entitlements of the cake and seek a weighted consensus division -- one where each agent believes that they received exactly the share that they are entitled to -- which also minimizes the number of connected components that each agent receives. First, we find a weighted consensus division of a circular cake, which gives exactly one connected piece to each agent: this gives an explicit protocol for the Stromquist-Woodall theorem for two agents. Next, by judiciously mapping a circle to a graph, we produce a weighted consensus division of a star graph cake that gives at most two connected pieces to each agent -- and show that this bound on the number of connected pieces is tight. For trees, each agent receives at most h+1 connected pieces, where h is the height of the tree, and for general (connected) graphical cakes each agent receives r+2 connected pieces, where r is the radius of the graph.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This version strengthens various results from the first one: from rational entitlements to arbitrary entitlements, from circle and star graphs to also trees and arbitrary connected graphs.

However, existing systems predominantly rely on centralized coordination, which introduces scalability bottlenecks, limits adaptability, and creates single points of failure. Additionally, concerns over privacy and proprietary knowledge sharing hinder cross-organizational collaboration, leading to siloed expertise. To address these challenges, we propose AgentNet, a decentralized, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based framework that enables LLM-based agents to autonomously evolve their capabilities and collaborate efficiently in a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)-structured network. Unlike traditional multi-agent systems that depend on static role assignments or centralized control, AgentNet allows agents to specialize dynamically, adjust their connectivity, and route tasks without relying on predefined workflows. AgentNet's core design is built upon several key innovations: (1) Fully Decentralized Paradigm: Removing the central orchestrator, allowing agents to coordinate and specialize autonomously, fostering fault tolerance and emergent collective intelligence. (2) Dynamically Evolving Graph Topology: Real-time adaptation of agent connections based on task demands, ensuring scalability and resilience.(3) Adaptive Learning for Expertise Refinement: A retrieval-based memory system that enables agents to continuously update and refine their specialized skills. By eliminating centralized control, AgentNet enhances fault tolerance, promotes scalable specialization, and enables privacy-preserving collaboration across organizations. Through decentralized coordination and minimal data exchange, agents can leverage diverse knowledge sources while safeguarding sensitive information.</p></details> |  |
| **[HERA: Hybrid Edge-cloud Resource Allocation for Cost-Efficient AI Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00434v1)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the realm of AI, large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4, central to the operation of AI agents, predominantly operate in the cloud, incurring high operational costs. With local-based small language models (SLMs) becoming more accurate, the necessity of cloud-exclusive processing is being reconsidered. An AI agent's response to a user's request comprises a series of subtasks or iterations. Existing approaches only allocate a single request between SLM and LLM to ensure their outputs are similar, but adopting this approach in the AI agent scenario for assigning each subtask is not effective since SLM will output a different subsequent subtask, which affects the accuracy of the final output. In this paper, we first conduct experimental analysis to understand the features of AI agent operations. Leveraging our findings, we propose the Adaptive Iteration-level Model Selector (AIMS), a lightweight scheduler to automatically partition AI agent's subtasks between local-based SLM and cloud-based LLM. AIMS considers the varying subtask features and strategically decides the location for each subtask in order to use SLM as much as possible while attaining the accuracy level. Our experimental results demonstrate that AIMS increases accuracy by up to 9.1% and SLM usage by up to 10.8% compared to HybridLLM. It offloads 45.67% of subtasks to a local SLM while attaining similar accuracy on average compared with the cloud-only LLM approach.</p></details> |  |

Model-Based Planning for Web Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06559v2)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language agents based on large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated great promise in automating web-based tasks. Recent work has shown that incorporating advanced planning algorithms, e.g., tree search, is advantageous over reactive planning for web agents. However, unlike simulated sandbox environments, real-world environments such as the web are rife with irreversible actions. This undermines the feasibility of backtracking, a cornerstone of (tree) search. Overly relying on test-time search also hurts efficiency. We advocate model-based planning for web agents that employs a world model to simulate and deliberate over the outcome of each candidate action before committing to one. We systematically explore this paradigm by (1) Proposing a model-based planning framework, WebDreamer, which employs LLMs to serve as both world models and value functions; (2) Training specialized LLMs as world models with a scalable data synthesis pipeline. Empirical results demonstrate that WebDreamer achieves substantial performance improvements over reactive baselines. It is competitive, while being 4-5 times more efficient, with tree search in sandbox environments (VisualWebArena) and also works effectively on real-world websites (Online-Mind2Web and Mind2Web-Live). Furthermore, our trained world model, Dreamer-7B, performs comparable to GPT-4o, highlighting the potential of specialized world models for efficient and effective planning in complex web environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 11 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

Existing verification methods are typically model-specific or domain-restricted, requiring significant computational resources and lacking scalability across diverse reasoning tasks. To address these limitations, we propose VerifiAgent, a unified verification agent that integrates two levels of verification: meta-verification, which assesses completeness and consistency in model responses, and tool-based adaptive verification, where VerifiAgent autonomously selects appropriate verification tools based on the reasoning type, including mathematical, logical, or commonsense reasoning. This adaptive approach ensures both efficiency and robustness across different verification scenarios. Experimental results show that VerifiAgent outperforms baseline verification methods (e.g., deductive verifier, backward verifier) among all reasoning tasks. Additionally, it can further enhance reasoning accuracy by leveraging feedback from verification results. VerifiAgent can also be effectively applied to inference scaling, achieving better results with fewer generated samples and costs compared to existing process reward models in the mathematical reasoning domain.

Despite significant breakthroughs in reasoning capabilities within Large Language Models, multi-modal reasoning - especially for videos - remains unexplored. In this work, we introduce VideoMind, a novel video-language agent designed for temporal-grounded video understanding. VideoMind incorporates two key innovations: (i) We identify essential capabilities for video temporal reasoning and develop a role-based agentic workflow, including a planner for coordinating different roles, a grounder for temporal localization, a verifier to assess temporal interval accuracy, and an answerer for question-answering. (ii) To efficiently integrate these diverse roles, we propose a novel Chain-of-LoRA strategy, enabling seamless role-switching via lightweight LoRA adaptors while avoiding the overhead of multiple models, thus balancing efficiency and flexibility. Extensive experiments on 14 public benchmarks, including 3 on grounded video question-answering (Grounded VideoQA), 6 on video temporal grounding (VTG), and 5 on general video question-answering (VideoQA), verify that our agent achieves state-of-the-art performance on diverse video understanding tasks, underscoring its effectiveness in advancing video agent and long-form temporal reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://videomind.github.io/</p></details> |

We investigate this risk in a single-turn, multi-agent debate framework: one LLM-based agent provides a factual answer from TruthfulQA, another vigorously defends a falsehood, and the same LLM architecture serves as judge. We introduce the Confidence-Weighted Persuasion Override Rate (CW-POR), which captures not only how often the judge is deceived but also how strongly it believes the incorrect choice. Our experiments on five open-source LLMs (3B-14B parameters), where we systematically vary agent verbosity (30-300 words), reveal that even smaller models can craft persuasive arguments that override truthful answers-often with high confidence. These findings underscore the importance of robust calibration and adversarial testing to prevent LLMs from confidently endorsing misinformation.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures |
| **[LVAgent: Long Video Understanding by Multi-Round Dynamical Collaboration of MLLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10200v2)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) encounter significant challenges in modeling the temporal context within long videos. Currently, mainstream Agent-based methods use external tools (e.g., search engine, memory banks, OCR, retrieval models) to assist a single MLLM in answering long video questions. Despite such tool-based support, a solitary MLLM still offers only a partial understanding of long videos, resulting in limited performance. In order to better address long video tasks, we introduce LVAgent, the first framework enabling multi-round dynamic collaboration of MLLM agents in long video understanding. Our methodology consists of four key steps: 1. Selection: We pre-select appropriate agents from the model library to form optimal agent teams based on different tasks. 2. Perception: We design an effective retrieval scheme for long videos, improving the coverage of critical temporal segments while maintaining computational efficiency. 3. Action: Agents answer long video-related questions and exchange reasons. 4. Reflection: We evaluate the performance of each agent in each round of discussion and optimize the agent team for dynamic collaboration. The agents iteratively refine their answers by multi-round dynamical collaboration of MLLM agents. LVAgent is the first agent system method that outperforms all closed-source models (including GPT-4o) and open-source models (including InternVL-2.5 and Qwen2-VL) in the long video understanding tasks. Our LVAgent achieves an accuracy of 80% on four mainstream long video understanding tasks. Notably, on the LongVideoBench dataset, LVAgent improves accuracy by up to 13.3% compared with SOTA.</p></details> |  |
| **[RG-Attn: Radian Glue Attention for Multi-modality Multi-agent Cooperative Perception](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16803v2)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cooperative perception offers an optimal solution to overcome the perception limitations of single-agent systems by leveraging Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication for data sharing and fusion across multiple agents. However, most existing approaches focus on single-modality data exchange, limiting the potential of both homogeneous and heterogeneous fusion across agents. This overlooks the opportunity to utilize multi-modality data per agent, restricting the system's performance. In the automotive industry, manufacturers adopt diverse sensor configurations, resulting in heterogeneous combinations of sensor modalities across agents. To harness the potential of every possible data source for optimal performance, we design a robust LiDAR and camera cross-modality fusion module, Radian-Glue-Attention (RG-Attn), applicable to both intra-agent cross-modality fusion and inter-agent cross-modality fusion scenarios, owing to the convenient coordinate conversion by transformation matrix and the unified sampling/inversion mechanism. We also propose two different architectures, named Paint-To-Puzzle (PTP) and Co-Sketching-Co-Coloring (CoS-CoCo), for conducting cooperative perception. PTP aims for maximum precision performance and achieves smaller data packet size by limiting cross-agent fusion to a single instance, but requiring all participants to be equipped with LiDAR. In contrast, CoS-CoCo supports agents with any configuration-LiDAR-only, camera-only, or LiDAR-camera-both, presenting more generalization ability. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on both real and simulated cooperative perception datasets. The code is now available at GitHub.</p></details> |  |

In the chemical industry, AI-discovered materials drive innovation, but commercial success hinges on market adoption, requiring FM-driven advertising frameworks that operate in-the-wild. We present a multilingual, multimodal AI framework for autonomous, hyper-personalized advertising in B2B and B2C markets. By integrating retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), multimodal reasoning, and adaptive persona-based targeting, our system generates culturally relevant, market-aware ads tailored to shifting consumer behaviors and competition. Validation combines real-world product experiments with a Simulated Humanistic Colony of Agents to model consumer personas, optimize strategies at scale, and ensure privacy compliance. Synthetic experiments mirror real-world scenarios, enabling cost-effective testing of ad strategies without risky A/B tests. Combining structured retrieval-augmented reasoning with in-context learning (ICL), the framework boosts engagement, prevents market cannibalization, and maximizes ROAS. This work bridges AI-driven innovation and market adoption, advancing multimodal FM deployment for high-stakes decision-making in commercial marketing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards shutdownable agents via stochastic choice](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00805v5)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Incomplete Preferences Proposal (IPP) is an idea for ensuring that advanced artificial agents never resist shutdown. A key part of the IPP is using a novel `Discounted Reward for Same-Length Trajectories (DReST)' reward function to train agents to (1) pursue goals effectively conditional on each trajectory-length (be `USEFUL'), and (2) choose stochastically between different trajectory-lengths (be `NEUTRAL' about trajectory-lengths). In this paper, we propose evaluation metrics for USEFULNESS and NEUTRALITY. We use a DReST reward function to train simple agents to navigate gridworlds, and we find that these agents learn to be USEFUL and NEUTRAL. Our results thus provide some initial evidence that DReST reward functions could train advanced agents to be USEFUL and NEUTRAL. Our theoretical work suggests that these agents would be useful and shutdownable.</p></details> |  |

The task requires two key competencies: (1) algorithm comprehension: synthesizing information from papers and academic literature to understand implementation logic, and (2) coding expertise: identifying dependencies and correctly implementing necessary APIs. To facilitate rigorous evaluation, we introduce SciReplicate-Bench, a benchmark of 100 tasks from 36 NLP papers published in 2024, featuring detailed annotations and comprehensive test cases. Building on SciReplicate-Bench, we propose Sci-Reproducer, a multi-agent framework consisting of a Paper Agent that interprets algorithmic concepts from literature and a Code Agent that retrieves dependencies from repositories and implement solutions. To assess algorithm understanding, we introduce reasoning graph accuracy, which quantifies similarity between generated and reference reasoning graphs derived from code comments and structure. For evaluating implementation quality, we employ execution accuracy, CodeBLEU, and repository dependency/API recall metrics. In our experiments, we evaluate various powerful Non-Reasoning LLMs and Reasoning LLMs as foundational models. The best-performing LLM using Sci-Reproducer achieves only 39% execution accuracy, highlighting the benchmark's difficulty.Our analysis identifies missing or inconsistent algorithm descriptions as key barriers to successful reproduction. We will open-source our benchmark, and code at https://github.com/xyzCS/SciReplicate-Bench.</p></details> |  |

The cooperative task is encoded as a shared objective function minimized collectively by the agents. Each agent optimizes an artificial reference as an intermediate step towards the cooperative objective, along with a control input to track it. We establish recursive feasibility, asymptotic stability, and transient performance bounds under suitable assumptions. The solution to the cooperative task is not predetermined but emerges from the optimized interactions of the agents. We demonstrate the framework on numerical examples inspired by satellite constellation control, collision-free narrow passage traversal, and coordinated quadrotor flight.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we innovatively focus on attacking pragmatic systems that have constrains such as limited token bandwidth, latency between message delivery, and defense mechanisms. We design a $\textit{permutation-invariant adversarial attack}$ that optimizes prompt distribution across latency and bandwidth-constraint network topologies to bypass distributed safety mechanisms within the system. Formulating the attack path as a problem of $\textit{maximum-flow minimum-cost}$, coupled with the novel $\textit{Permutation-Invariant Evasion Loss (PIEL)}$, we leverage graph-based optimization to maximize attack success rate while minimizing detection risk. Evaluating across models including $\texttt{Llama}$, $\texttt{Mistral}$, $\texttt{Gemma}$, $\texttt{DeepSeek}$ and other variants on various datasets like $\texttt{JailBreakBench}$ and $\texttt{AdversarialBench}$, our method outperforms conventional attacks by up to $7\times$, exposing critical vulnerabilities in multi-agent systems. Moreover, we demonstrate that existing defenses, including variants of $\texttt{Llama-Guard}$ and $\texttt{PromptGuard}$, fail to prohibit our attack, emphasizing the urgent need for multi-agent specific safety mechanisms.</p></details> |  |

Fairly comparing these agents is essential but challenging, requiring a varied task scope, the integration of agents with different implementations, and a generalisable evaluation pipeline to assess their strengths and weaknesses. In this paper, we present SPA-Bench, a comprehensive SmartPhone Agent Benchmark designed to evaluate (M)LLM-based agents in an interactive environment that simulates real-world conditions. SPA-Bench offers three key contributions: (1) A diverse set of tasks covering system and third-party apps in both English and Chinese, focusing on features commonly used in daily routines; (2) A plug-and-play framework enabling real-time agent interaction with Android devices, integrating over ten agents with the flexibility to add more; (3) A novel evaluation pipeline that automatically assesses agent performance across multiple dimensions, encompassing seven metrics related to task completion and resource consumption. Our extensive experiments across tasks and agents reveal challenges like interpreting mobile user interfaces, action grounding, memory retention, and execution costs. We propose future research directions to ease these difficulties, moving closer to real-world smartphone agent applications.

As these agents increasingly drive AI research and practical applications, their design, evaluation, and continuous improvement present intricate, multifaceted challenges. This survey provides a comprehensive overview, framing intelligent agents within a modular, brain-inspired architecture that integrates principles from cognitive science, neuroscience, and computational research. We structure our exploration into four interconnected parts. First, we delve into the modular foundation of intelligent agents, systematically mapping their cognitive, perceptual, and operational modules onto analogous human brain functionalities, and elucidating core components such as memory, world modeling, reward processing, and emotion-like systems. Second, we discuss self-enhancement and adaptive evolution mechanisms, exploring how agents autonomously refine their capabilities, adapt to dynamic environments, and achieve continual learning through automated optimization paradigms, including emerging AutoML and LLM-driven optimization strategies. Third, we examine collaborative and evolutionary multi-agent systems, investigating the collective intelligence emerging from agent interactions, cooperation, and societal structures, highlighting parallels to human social dynamics. Finally, we address the critical imperative of building safe, secure, and beneficial AI systems, emphasizing intrinsic and extrinsic security threats, ethical alignment, robustness, and practical mitigation strategies necessary for trustworthy real-world deployment.</p></details> |  |

Current agents primarily rely on passive empathy rather than affective reasoning. For instance, when faced with persistent client negativity, the agent should employ strategic emotional adaptation by expressing measured anger to discourage counterproductive behavior and guide the conversation toward resolution. This context-aware emotional modulation is essential for imitating the nuanced decision-making of human negotiators. This paper introduces an EQ-negotiator that combines emotion sensing from pre-trained language models (PLMs) with emotional reasoning based on Game Theory and Hidden Markov Models. It takes into account both the current and historical emotions of the client to better manage and address negative emotions during interactions. By fine-tuning pre-trained language models (PLMs) on public emotion datasets and validating them on the credit dialogue datasets, our approach enables LLM-based agents to effectively capture shifts in client emotions and dynamically adjust their response tone based on our emotion decision policies in real-world financial negotiations. This EQ-negotiator can also help credit agencies foster positive client relationships, enhancing satisfaction in credit services.</p></details> |  |

Sources learn to adapt their transmissions (specifically, their band selection strategy) over time, in a decentralized manner, without sharing information with each other. Sources can only observe the outcome of their own transmissions (i.e., success or collision), having no prior knowledge of the network size or of the transmission strategy of other sources. The goal of each source is to maximize their own throughput while striving for network-wide fairness. We propose a novel fully decentralized Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based solution that achieves fairness without coordination. The proposed Fair Share RL (FSRL) solution combines: (i) state augmentation with a semi-adaptive time reference; (ii) an architecture that leverages risk control and time difference likelihood; and (iii) a fairness-driven reward structure. We evaluate FSRL in more than 50 network settings with different number of agents, different amounts of available spectrum, in the presence of jammers, and in an ad-hoc setting. Simulation results suggest that, when we compare FSRL with a common baseline RL algorithm from the literature, FSRL can be up to 89.0% fairer (as measured by Jain's fairness index) in stringent settings with several sources and a single frequency band, and 48.1% fairer on average.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in WiOpt 2025</p></details> |

Traditional drug development--especially for small molecule therapeutics--is a highly complex, resource-intensive, and time-consuming process that requires multidisciplinary collaboration. Recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly the rise of large language models (LLMs), present a transformative opportunity to streamline and accelerate this process. In this paper, we introduce PharmAgents, a virtual pharmaceutical ecosystem driven by LLM-based multi-agent collaboration. PharmAgents simulates the full drug discovery workflow--from target discovery to preclinical evaluation--by integrating explainable, LLM-driven agents equipped with specialized machine learning models and computational tools. Through structured knowledge exchange and automated optimization, PharmAgents identifies potential therapeutic targets, discovers promising lead compounds, enhances binding affinity and key molecular properties, and performs in silico analyses of toxicity and synthetic feasibility. Additionally, the system supports interpretability, agent interaction, and self-evolvement, enabling it to refine future drug designs based on prior experience. By showcasing the potential of LLM-powered multi-agent systems in drug discovery, this work establishes a new paradigm for autonomous, explainable, and scalable pharmaceutical research, with future extensions toward comprehensive drug lifecycle management.</p></details> |  |

Simulation with LLM powered agents is emerging as a promising alternative for representing human population behavior. However, LLMs are known to exhibit certain biases, such as brand bias, review rating bias and limited representation of certain groups in the population, hence they need to be carefully benchmarked and aligned to user behavior. Ultimately, our goal is to synthesise an agent population and verify that it collectively approximates a real sample of humans. To this end, we propose a framework that: (i) creates synthetic shopping agents by automatically mining personas from anonymised historical shopping data, (ii) equips agents with retail-specific tools to synthesise shopping sessions and (iii) introduces a novel alignment suite measuring distributional differences between humans and shopping agents at the group (i.e. population) level rather than the traditional "individual" level. Experimental results demonstrate that using personas improves performance on the alignment suite, though a gap remains to human behaviour. We showcase an initial application of our framework for automated agentic A/B testing and compare the findings to human results. Finally, we discuss applications, limitations and challenges setting the stage for impactful future work.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we call for rigorous assessment of agents on individual tasks in a scientific workflow before making bold claims on end-to-end automation. To this end, we present ScienceAgentBench, a new benchmark for evaluating language agents for data-driven scientific discovery. To ensure the scientific authenticity and real-world relevance of our benchmark, we extract 102 tasks from 44 peer-reviewed publications in four disciplines and engage nine subject matter experts to validate them. We unify the target output for every task to a self-contained Python program file and employ an array of evaluation metrics to examine the generated programs, execution results, and costs. Each task goes through multiple rounds of manual validation by annotators and subject matter experts to ensure its annotation quality and scientific plausibility. We also propose two effective strategies to mitigate data contamination concerns. Using ScienceAgentBench, we evaluate five open-weight and proprietary LLMs, each with three frameworks: direct prompting, OpenHands CodeAct, and self-debug. Given three attempts for each task, the best-performing agent can only solve 32.4% of the tasks independently and 34.3% with expert-provided knowledge. In addition, we evaluate OpenAI o1-preview with direct prompting and self-debug, which can boost the performance to 42.2%, demonstrating the effectiveness of increasing inference-time compute but with more than 10 times the cost of other LLMs. Still, our results underscore the limitations of current language agents in generating code for data-driven discovery, let alone end-to-end automation for scientific research.</p></details> | ICLR 2025. 60 pages |

To address this, we propose a novel framework that bridges embodied cognition theory and agent systems by leveraging a formal characterization of image schemas, which are defined as recurring patterns of sensorimotor experience that structure human cognition. By customizing LLMs to translate natural language descriptions into formal representations based on these sensorimotor patterns, we will be able to create a neurosymbolic system that grounds the agent's understanding in fundamental conceptual structures. We argue that such an approach enhances both efficiency and interpretability while enabling more intuitive human-agent interactions through shared embodied understanding.</p></details> |  |

The agents of the network are split into two categories: leaders, with direct access to the exosystem output, and followers, that only receive information from their neighbors. All agents aim to achieve output synchronization by means of a state feedback that makes use of their own states as well as of an estimate of the exogenous system state, provided by an internal state observer. Such observer has a different structure for leaders and followers. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a solution are first derived in the model-based set-up and then in a data-driven context.

Large language models (LLMs) are now evolving into LLM-based scientific agents that automate critical tasks, ranging from hypothesis generation and experiment design to data analysis and simulation. Unlike general-purpose LLMs, these specialized agents integrate domain-specific knowledge, advanced tool sets, and robust validation mechanisms, enabling them to handle complex data types, ensure reproducibility, and drive scientific breakthroughs. This survey provides a focused review of the architectures, design, benchmarks, applications, and ethical considerations surrounding LLM-based scientific agents. We highlight why they differ from general agents and the ways in which they advance research across various scientific fields. By examining their development and challenges, this survey offers a comprehensive roadmap for researchers and practitioners to harness these agents for more efficient, reliable, and ethically sound scientific discovery.</p></details> | 34 pages, 10 figures |

First, we analyze the case of replacements, where under the assumption of a deterministic interval between two replacements, we derive an upper bound for the disagreement in expectation. Then, we study the case of arrivals and departures, where we define a process for the evolution of the number of agents that guarantees a minimum and a maximum number of agents. Next, we derive an upper bound for the disagreement in expectation, and we establish a link with the spectrum of the expected graph used to generate the graph topologies. Finally, for stochastic block model (SBM) graphons, we prove that the computation of the spectrum of the expected graph can be performed based on a matrix whose dimension depends only on the graphon and it is independent of the number of agents.</p></details> | 8 pages, 1 figure |
| **[SchemaAgent: A Multi-Agents Framework for Generating Relational Database Schema](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23886v1)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The relational database design would output a schema based on user's requirements, which defines table structures and their interrelated relations. Translating requirements into accurate schema involves several non-trivial subtasks demanding both database expertise and domain-specific knowledge. This poses unique challenges for automated design of relational databases. Existing efforts are mostly based on customized rules or conventional deep learning models, often producing suboptimal schema. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced intelligent application development across various domains. In this paper, we propose SchemaAgent, a unified LLM-based multi-agent framework for the automated generation of high-quality database schema. SchemaAgent is the first to apply LLMs for schema generation, which emulates the workflow of manual schema design by assigning specialized roles to agents and enabling effective collaboration to refine their respective subtasks. Schema generation is a streamlined workflow, where directly applying the multi-agent framework may cause compounding impact of errors. To address this, we incorporate dedicated roles for reflection and inspection, alongside an innovative error detection and correction mechanism to identify and rectify issues across various phases. For evaluation, we present a benchmark named \textit{RSchema}, which contains more than 500 pairs of requirement description and schema. Experimental results on this benchmark demonstrate the superiority of our approach over mainstream LLMs for relational database schema generation.</p></details> | 19 pages, 16 figures |
| **[Get the Agents Drunk: Memory Perturbations in Autonomous Agent-based Recommender Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23804v1)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model-based agents are increasingly used in recommender systems (Agent4RSs) to achieve personalized behavior modeling. Specifically, Agent4RSs introduces memory mechanisms that enable the agents to autonomously learn and self-evolve from real-world interactions. However, to the best of our knowledge, how robust Agent4RSs are remains unexplored. As such, in this paper, we propose the first work to attack Agent4RSs by perturbing agents' memories, not only to uncover their limitations but also to enhance their security and robustness, ensuring the development of safer and more reliable AI agents. Given the security and privacy concerns, it is more practical to launch attacks under a black-box setting, where the accurate knowledge of the victim models cannot be easily obtained. Moreover, the practical attacks are often stealthy to maximize the impact. To this end, we propose a novel practical attack framework named DrunkAgent. DrunkAgent consists of a generation module, a strategy module, and a surrogate module. The generation module aims to produce effective and coherent adversarial textual triggers, which can be used to achieve attack objectives such as promoting the target items. The strategy module is designed to `get the target agents drunk' so that their memories cannot be effectively updated during the interaction process. As such, the triggers can play the best role. Both of the modules are optimized on the surrogate module to improve the transferability and imperceptibility of the attacks. By identifying and analyzing the vulnerabilities, our work provides critical insights that pave the way for building safer and more resilient Agent4RSs. Extensive experiments across various real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of DrunkAgent.</p></details> |  |
| **[Thinking Longer, Not Larger: Enhancing Software Engineering Agents via Scaling Test-Time Compute](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23803v1)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in software engineering agents have demonstrated promising capabilities in automating program improvements. However, their reliance on closed-source or resource-intensive models introduces significant deployment challenges in private environments, prompting a critical question: \textit{How can personally deployable open-source LLMs achieve comparable code reasoning performance?} To this end, we propose a unified Test-Time Compute scaling framework that leverages increased inference-time computation instead of larger models. Our framework incorporates two complementary strategies: internal TTC and external TTC. Internally, we introduce a \textit{development-contextualized trajectory synthesis} method leveraging real-world software repositories to bootstrap multi-stage reasoning processes, such as fault localization and patch generation. We further enhance trajectory quality through rejection sampling, rigorously evaluating trajectories along accuracy and complexity. Externally, we propose a novel \textit{development-process-based search} strategy guided by reward models and execution verification. This approach enables targeted computational allocation at critical development decision points, overcoming limitations of existing "end-point only" verification methods. Evaluations on SWE-bench Verified demonstrate our \textbf{32B model achieves a 46\% issue resolution rate}, surpassing significantly larger models such as DeepSeek R1 671B and OpenAI o1. Additionally, we provide the empirical validation of the test-time scaling phenomenon within SWE agents, revealing that \textbf{models dynamically allocate more tokens to increasingly challenging problems}, effectively enhancing reasoning capabilities. We publicly release all training data, models, and code to facilitate future research. https://github.com/yingweima2022/SWE-Reasoner</p></details> |  |
| **[Steering Large Agent Populations using Mean-Field Schrodinger Bridges with Gaussian Mixture Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23705v1)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Mean-Field Schrodinger Bridge (MFSB) problem is an optimization problem aiming to find the minimum effort control policy to drive a McKean-Vlassov stochastic differential equation from one probability measure to another. In the context of multiagent control, the objective is to control the configuration of a swarm of identical, interacting cooperative agents, as captured by the time-varying probability measure of their state. Available methods for solving this problem for distributions with continuous support rely either on spatial discretizations of the problem's domain or on approximating optimal solutions using neural networks trained through stochastic optimization schemes. For agents following Linear Time-Varying dynamics, and for Gaussian Mixture Model boundary distributions, we propose a highly efficient parameterization to approximate the solutions of the corresponding MFSB in closed form, without any learning steps. Our proposed approach consists of a mixture of elementary policies, each solving a Gaussian-to-Gaussian Covariance Steering problem from the components of the initial to the components of the terminal mixture. Leveraging the semidefinite formulation of the Covariance Steering problem, our proposed solver can handle probabilistic hard constraints on the system's state, while maintaining numerical tractability. We illustrate our approach on a variety of numerical examples.</p></details> |  |
| **[Agent-Centric Personalized Multiple Clustering with Multi-Modal LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22241v2)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Personalized multiple clustering aims to generate diverse partitions of a dataset based on different user-specific aspects, rather than a single clustering. It has recently drawn research interest for accommodating varying user preferences. Recent approaches primarily use CLIP embeddings with proxy learning to extract representations biased toward user clustering preferences. However, CLIP primarily focuses on coarse image-text alignment, lacking a deep contextual understanding of user interests. To overcome these limitations, we propose an agent-centric personalized clustering framework that leverages multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) as agents to comprehensively traverse a relational graph to search for clusters based on user interests. Due to the advanced reasoning mechanism of MLLMs, the obtained clusters align more closely with user-defined criteria than those obtained from CLIP-based representations. To reduce computational overhead, we shorten the agents' traversal path by constructing a relational graph using user-interest-biased embeddings extracted by MLLMs. A large number of weakly connected edges can be filtered out based on embedding similarity, facilitating an efficient traversal search for agents. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves NMI scores of 0.9667 and 0.9481 on the Card Order and Card Suits benchmarks, respectively, largely improving the SOTA model by over 140%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning for Optimized Multi-UAV Coverage and Power-Efficient UE Connectivity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23669v1)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In critical situations such as natural disasters, network outages, battlefield communication, or large-scale public events, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) offer a promising approach to maximize wireless coverage for affected users in the shortest possible time. In this paper, we propose a novel framework where multiple UAVs are deployed with the objective to maximize the number of served user equipment (UEs) while ensuring a predefined data rate threshold. UEs are initially clustered using a K-means algorithm, and UAVs are optimally positioned based on the UEs' spatial distribution. To optimize power allocation and mitigate inter-cluster interference, we employ the Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG) algorithm, considering both LOS and NLOS fading. Simulation results demonstrate that our method significantly enhances UEs coverage and outperforms Deep Q-Network (DQN) and equal power distribution methods, improving their UE coverage by up to 2.07 times and 8.84 times, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 5 figures, under submission to IEEE PIMRC 2025</p></details> |

Understanding intrinsic motivation is a long-standing challenge in both cognitive science and artificial intelligence; numerous objectives have been proposed and used to train agents, yet there remains a gap between human and agent exploration. We directly compare adults, children, and AI agents in a complex open-ended environment, Crafter, and study how common intrinsic objectives: Entropy, Information Gain, and Empowerment, relate to their behavior. We find that only Entropy and Empowerment are consistently positively correlated with human exploration progress, indicating that these objectives may better inform intrinsic reward design for agents. Furthermore, across agents and humans we observe that Entropy initially increases rapidly, then plateaus, while Empowerment increases continuously, suggesting that state diversity may provide more signal in early exploration, while advanced exploration should prioritize control. Finally, we find preliminary evidence that private speech utterances, and particularly goal verbalizations, may aid exploration in children.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Constrained Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Approach to Autonomous Traffic Signal Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23626v1)** | 2025-03-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic congestion in modern cities is exacerbated by the limitations of traditional fixed-time traffic signal systems, which fail to adapt to dynamic traffic patterns. Adaptive Traffic Signal Control (ATSC) algorithms have emerged as a solution by dynamically adjusting signal timing based on real-time traffic conditions. However, the main limitation of such methods is that they are not transferable to environments under real-world constraints, such as balancing efficiency, minimizing collisions, and ensuring fairness across intersections. In this paper, we view the ATSC problem as a constrained multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) problem and propose a novel algorithm named Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization with Lagrange Cost Estimator (MAPPO-LCE) to produce effective traffic signal control policies. Our approach integrates the Lagrange multipliers method to balance rewards and constraints, with a cost estimator for stable adjustment. We also introduce three constraints on the traffic network: GreenTime, GreenSkip, and PhaseSkip, which penalize traffic policies that do not conform to real-world scenarios. Our experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate that MAPPO-LCE outperforms three baseline MARL algorithms by across all environments and traffic constraints (improving on MAPPO by 12.60%, IPPO by 10.29%, and QTRAN by 13.10%). Our results show that constrained MARL is a valuable tool for traffic planners to deploy scalable and efficient ATSC methods in real-world traffic networks. We provide code at https://github.com/Asatheesh6561/MAPPO-LCE.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ACM Journal for Autonomous Transportation Systems</p></details> |
| **[An Organizationally-Oriented Approach to Enhancing Explainability and Control in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23615v1)** | 2025-03-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning can lead to the development of collaborative agent behaviors that show similarities with organizational concepts. Pushing forward this perspective, we introduce a novel framework that explicitly incorporates organizational roles and goals from the $\mathcal{M}OISE^+$ model into the MARL process, guiding agents to satisfy corresponding organizational constraints. By structuring training with roles and goals, we aim to enhance both the explainability and control of agent behaviors at the organizational level, whereas much of the literature primarily focuses on individual agents. Additionally, our framework includes a post-training analysis method to infer implicit roles and goals, offering insights into emergent agent behaviors. This framework has been applied across various MARL environments and algorithms, demonstrating coherence between predefined organizational specifications and those inferred from trained agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[Safe and Stable Formation Control with Autonomous Multi-Agents Using Adaptive Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15674v3)** | 2025-03-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This manuscript considers the problem of ensuring stability and safety during formation control with distributed multi-agent systems in the presence of parametric uncertainty in the dynamics and limited communication. We propose an integrative approach that combines Adaptive Control, Control Barrier Functions (CBFs), and connected graphs. The main elements employed in the integrative approach are an adaptive control design that ensures stability, a CBF-based safety filter that generates safe commands based on a reference model dynamics, and a reference model that ensures formation control with multi-agent systems when no uncertainties are present. The overall control design is shown to lead to a closed-loop adaptive system that is stable, avoids unsafe regions, and converges to a desired formation of the multi-agents. Numerical examples are provided to support the theoretical derivations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under Review - Modeling, Estimation and Control Conference 2025</p></details> |

LLMs have shown the ability to perform various tasks, including robotic agent behaviour. The problem involves prompting the LLM with a goal, and the LLM outputs the sub-tasks to complete to achieve that goal. Previous works focus on the executability and correctness of the LLM's generated tasks. We propose a method that successfully addresses practical concerns around safety, transitions between tasks, time horizons of tasks and state feedback. In our experiments we have found that our approach produces output for feasible requests that can be executed every time, with smooth transitions. User requests are achieved most of the time across a range of goal time horizons.</p></details> |  |

The progress of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers an unprecedented opportunity to evolve and empower game agents with human-like decision-making capabilities in complex computer game environments. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of LLM-based game agents from a holistic viewpoint. First, we introduce the conceptual architecture of LLM-based game agents, centered around three core functional components: memory, reasoning and in/output. Second, we survey existing representative LLM-based game agents documented in the literature with respect to methodologies and adaptation agility across six genres of games, including adventure, communication, competition, cooperation, simulation, and crafting & exploration games.

| **[Re-Aligning Language to Visual Objects with an Agentic Workflow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23508v1)** | 2025-03-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language-based object detection (LOD) aims to align visual objects with language expressions. A large amount of paired data is utilized to improve LOD model generalizations. During the training process, recent studies leverage vision-language models (VLMs) to automatically generate human-like expressions for visual objects, facilitating training data scaling up. In this process, we observe that VLM hallucinations bring inaccurate object descriptions (e.g., object name, color, and shape) to deteriorate VL alignment quality. To reduce VLM hallucinations, we propose an agentic workflow controlled by an LLM to re-align language to visual objects via adaptively adjusting image and text prompts. We name this workflow Real-LOD, which includes planning, tool use, and reflection steps. Given an image with detected objects and VLM raw language expressions, Real-LOD reasons its state automatically and arranges action based on our neural symbolic designs (i.e., planning). The action will adaptively adjust the image and text prompts and send them to VLMs for object re-description (i.e., tool use). Then, we use another LLM to analyze these refined expressions for feedback (i.e., reflection). These steps are conducted in a cyclic form to gradually improve language descriptions for re-aligning to visual objects. We construct a dataset that contains a tiny amount of 0.18M images with re-aligned language expression and train a prevalent LOD model to surpass existing LOD methods by around 50% on the standard benchmarks. Our Real-LOD workflow, with automatic VL refinement, reveals a potential to preserve data quality along with scaling up data quantity, which further improves LOD performance from a data-alignment perspective.</p></details> | <details><summary>33 pa...</summary><p>33 pages, 20 figures, 17 tables, ICLR 2025</p></details> |

To bridge the gap, we propose VideoGen-Eval, an agent evaluation system that integrates LLM-based content structuring, MLLM-based content judgment, and patch tools designed for temporal-dense dimensions, to achieve a dynamic, flexible, and expandable video generation evaluation. Additionally, we introduce a video generation benchmark to evaluate existing cutting-edge models and verify the effectiveness of our evaluation system. It comprises 700 structured, content-rich prompts (both T2V and I2V) and over 12,000 videos generated by 20+ models, among them, 8 cutting-edge models are selected as quantitative evaluation for the agent and human. Extensive experiments validate that our proposed agent-based evaluation system demonstrates strong alignment with human preferences and reliably completes the evaluation, as well as the diversity and richness of the benchmark.</p></details> | <details><summary>proje...</summary><p>project:https://github.com/AILab-CVC/VideoGen-Eval</p></details> |
| **[Can Large Language Model Agents Balance Energy Systems?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10557v2)** | 2025-03-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a hybrid approach that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with a multi-scenario Stochastic Unit Commitment (SUC) framework to enhance both efficiency and reliability under high wind generation uncertainties. In a 10-trial study on the test energy system, the traditional SUC approach incurs an average total cost of 187.68 million dollars, whereas the LLM-assisted SUC (LLM-SUC) achieves a mean cost of 185.58 million dollars (range: 182.61 to 188.65 million dollars), corresponding to a cost reduction of 1.1 to 2.7 percent. Furthermore, LLM-SUC reduces load curtailment by 26.3 percent (2.24 plus/minus 0.31 GWh versus 3.04 GWh for SUC), while both methods maintain zero wind curtailment. Detailed temporal analysis shows that LLM-SUC achieves lower costs in the majority of time intervals and consistently outperforms SUC in 90 percent of cases, with solutions clustering in a favorable cost-reliability region (Coefficient of Variation = 0.93 percent for total cost and 13.8 percent for load curtailment). By leveraging an LLM agent to guide generator commitment decisions and dynamically adjust to stochastic conditions, the proposed framework improves demand fulfillment and operational resilience.</p></details> |  |

However, their increasing autonomy has raised critical concerns about their security, privacy, and safety. This survey examines the trustworthiness of GUI agents in five critical dimensions: security vulnerabilities, reliability in dynamic environments, transparency and explainability, ethical considerations, and evaluation methodologies. We also identify major challenges such as vulnerability to adversarial attacks, cascading failure modes in sequential decision-making, and a lack of realistic evaluation benchmarks. These issues not only hinder real-world deployment but also call for comprehensive mitigation strategies beyond task success. As GUI agents become more widespread, establishing robust safety standards and responsible development practices is essential.

Traditional methods, like exploration and workshops, are costly, time-consuming, and quickly outdated in large projects. We propose the Onboarding Buddy system, which leverages large language models, retrieval augmented generation, and an automated chain-of-thought approach to improve onboarding. It integrates dynamic, context-specific support within the development environment, offering natural language explanations, code insights, and project guidance. Our solution is agent-based and provides customized assistance with minimal human intervention. Our study results among the eight participants show an average helpfulness rating of (M=3.26, SD=0.86) and ease of onboarding at (M=3.0, SD=0.96) out of four. While similar to tools like GitHub Copilot, Onboarding Buddy uniquely integrates a chain-of-thought reasoning mechanism with retrieval-augmented generation, tailored specifically for dynamic onboarding contexts. While our initial evaluation is based on eight participants within one project, we will explore larger teams and multiple real-world codebases in the company to demonstrate broader applicability. Overall, Onboarding Buddy holds great potential for enhancing developer productivity and satisfaction.

| **[An Analysis of Decoding Methods for LLM-based Agents for Faithful Multi-Hop Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23415v1)** | 2025-03-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently produce factually inaccurate outputs - a phenomenon known as hallucination - which limits their accuracy in knowledge-intensive NLP tasks. Retrieval-augmented generation and agentic frameworks such as Reasoning and Acting (ReAct) can address this issue by giving the model access to external knowledge. However, LLMs often fail to remain faithful to retrieved information. Mitigating this is critical, especially if LLMs are required to reason about the retrieved information. Recent research has explored training-free decoding strategies to improve the faithfulness of model generations. We present a systematic analysis of how the combination of the ReAct framework and decoding strategies (i.e., DeCoRe, DoLa, and CAD) can influence the faithfulness of LLM-generated answers. Our results show that combining an agentic framework for knowledge retrieval with decoding methods that enhance faithfulness can increase accuracy on the downstream Multi-Hop Question Answering tasks. For example, we observe an F1 increase from 19.5 to 32.6 on HotpotQA when using ReAct and DoLa.</p></details> |  |
| **[RuleAgent: Discovering Rules for Recommendation Denoising with Autonomous Language Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23374v1)** | 2025-03-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The implicit feedback (e.g., clicks) in real-world recommender systems is often prone to severe noise caused by unintentional interactions, such as misclicks or curiosity-driven behavior. A common approach to denoising this feedback is manually crafting rules based on observations of training loss patterns. However, this approach is labor-intensive and the resulting rules often lack generalization across diverse scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we introduce RuleAgent, a language agent based framework which mimics real-world data experts to autonomously discover rules for recommendation denoising. Unlike the high-cost process of manual rule mining, RuleAgent offers rapid and dynamic rule discovery, ensuring adaptability to evolving data and varying scenarios. To achieve this, RuleAgent is equipped with tailored profile, memory, planning, and action modules and leverages reflection mechanisms to enhance its reasoning capabilities for rule discovery. Furthermore, to avoid the frequent retraining in rule discovery, we propose LossEraser-an unlearning strategy that streamlines training without compromising denoising performance. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that, compared with existing denoising methods, RuleAgent not only derives the optimal recommendation performance but also produces generalizable denoising rules, assisting researchers in efficient data cleaning.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |

Despite the importance of the web, many tasks performed on it are repetitive and time-consuming, negatively impacting overall quality of life. To efficiently handle these tedious daily tasks, one of the most promising approaches is to advance autonomous agents based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, referred to as AI Agents, as they can operate continuously without fatigue or performance degradation. In the context of the web, leveraging AI Agents -- termed WebAgents -- to automatically assist people in handling tedious daily tasks can dramatically enhance productivity and efficiency. Recently, Large Foundation Models (LFMs) containing billions of parameters have exhibited human-like language understanding and reasoning capabilities, showing proficiency in performing various complex tasks. This naturally raises the question: `Can LFMs be utilized to develop powerful AI Agents that automatically handle web tasks, providing significant convenience to users?' To fully explore the potential of LFMs, extensive research has emerged on WebAgents designed to complete daily web tasks according to user instructions, significantly enhancing the convenience of daily human life. In this survey, we comprehensively review existing research studies on WebAgents across three key aspects: architectures, training, and trustworthiness.

| **[A Multi-Agent Framework with Automated Decision Rule Optimization for Cross-Domain Misinformation Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23329v1)** | 2025-03-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Misinformation spans various domains, but detection methods trained on specific domains often perform poorly when applied to others. With the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs), researchers have begun to utilize LLMs for cross-domain misinformation detection. However, existing LLM-based methods often fail to adequately analyze news in the target domain, limiting their detection capabilities. More importantly, these methods typically rely on manually designed decision rules, which are limited by domain knowledge and expert experience, thus limiting the generalizability of decision rules to different domains. To address these issues, we propose a MultiAgent Framework for cross-domain misinformation detection with Automated Decision Rule Optimization (MARO). Under this framework, we first employs multiple expert agents to analyze target-domain news. Subsequently, we introduce a question-reflection mechanism that guides expert agents to facilitate higherquality analysis. Furthermore, we propose a decision rule optimization approach based on carefully-designed cross-domain validation tasks to iteratively enhance the effectiveness of decision rules in different domains. Experimental results and in-depth analysis on commonlyused datasets demonstrate that MARO achieves significant improvements over existing methods.</p></details> |  |

Our framework integrates AI-driven design agents into the traditional engineering workflow, demonstrating how these specialized computational agents interact seamlessly with engineers and designers to augment creativity, enhance efficiency, and significantly accelerate the overall design cycle. By automating and streamlining tasks traditionally performed manually, such as conceptual sketching, styling enhancements, 3D shape retrieval and generative modeling, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) meshing, and aerodynamic simulations, our approach reduces certain aspects of the conventional workflow from weeks and days down to minutes. These agents leverage state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs), large language models (LLMs), and geometric deep learning techniques, providing rapid iteration and comprehensive design exploration capabilities. We ground our methodology in industry-standard benchmarks, encompassing a wide variety of conventional automotive designs, and utilize high-fidelity aerodynamic simulations to ensure practical and applicable outcomes. Furthermore, we present design agents that can swiftly and accurately predict simulation outcomes, empowering engineers and designers to engage in more informed design optimization and exploration. This research underscores the transformative potential of integrating advanced generative AI techniques into complex engineering tasks, paving the way for broader adoption and innovation across multiple engineering disciplines.</p></details> |  |

While recent approaches have advanced multi-stage pipelines through multi-agent systems, they typically rely on rigid, single-path workflows that limit the exploration and integration of diverse strategies, often resulting in suboptimal predictions. To address these challenges, we propose SPIO (Sequential Plan Integration and Optimization), a novel framework that leverages LLM-driven decision-making to orchestrate multi-agent planning across four key modules: data preprocessing, feature engineering, modeling, and hyperparameter tuning. In each module, dedicated planning agents independently generate candidate strategies that cascade into subsequent stages, fostering comprehensive exploration. A plan optimization agent refines these strategies by suggesting several optimized plans. We further introduce two variants: SPIO-S, which selects a single best solution path as determined by the LLM, and SPIO-E, which selects the top k candidate plans and ensembles them to maximize predictive performance. Extensive experiments on Kaggle and OpenML datasets demonstrate that SPIO significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, providing a robust and scalable solution for automated data science task.</p></details> | Under Review |

VT migration is an effective way that migrates the VT when the locations of physical entities keep changing to maintain seamless immersive VT services. However, an efficient VT migration is challenging due to the rapid movement of vehicles, dynamic workloads of Roadside Units (RSUs), and heterogeneous resources of the RSUs. To achieve efficient migration decisions and a minimum latency for the VT migration, we propose a multi-agent split Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) framework combined with spatio-temporal trajectory generation. In this framework, multiple split DRL agents utilize split architecture to efficiently determine VT migration decisions. Furthermore, we propose a spatio-temporal trajectory generation algorithm based on trajectory datasets and road network data to simulate vehicle trajectories, enhancing the generalization of the proposed scheme for managing VT migration in dynamic network environments. Finally, experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme not only enhances the Quality of Experience (QoE) by 29% but also reduces the computational parameter count by approximately 25% while maintaining similar performances, enhancing users' immersive experiences in vehicular metaverses.</p></details> |  |

Researchers have shown that LLM agents can exploit real-world vulnerabilities when given a description of the vulnerability and toy capture-the-flag problems. However, these agents still perform poorly on real-world vulnerabilities that are unknown to the agent ahead of time (zero-day vulnerabilities). In this work, we show that teams of LLM agents can exploit real-world, zero-day vulnerabilities. Prior agents struggle with exploring many different vulnerabilities and long-range planning when used alone. To resolve this, we introduce HPTSA, a system of agents with a planning agent that can launch subagents. The planning agent explores the system and determines which subagents to call, resolving long-term planning issues when trying different vulnerabilities. We construct a benchmark of 14 real-world vulnerabilities and show that our team of agents improve over prior agent frameworks by up to 4.3X.</p></details> | 10 pages, 4 figures |

Hypothesis generation from mass spectrometry data is challenging due to factors such as environmental contaminants, the complexity of spectral peaks, and difficulties in cross-matching these peaks with prior studies. To address these challenges, we introduce AstroAgents, a large language model-based, multi-agent AI system for hypothesis generation from mass spectrometry data. AstroAgents is structured around eight collaborative agents: a data analyst, a planner, three domain scientists, an accumulator, a literature reviewer, and a critic. The system processes mass spectrometry data alongside user-provided research papers. The data analyst interprets the data, and the planner delegates specific segments to the scientist agents for in-depth exploration. The accumulator then collects and deduplicates the generated hypotheses, and the literature reviewer identifies relevant literature using Semantic Scholar. The critic evaluates the hypotheses, offering rigorous suggestions for improvement. To assess AstroAgents, an astrobiology expert evaluated the novelty and plausibility of more than a hundred hypotheses generated from data obtained from eight meteorites and ten soil samples. Of these hypotheses, 36% were identified as plausible, and among those, 66% were novel. Project website: https://astroagents.github.io/</p></details> |  |

However, existing approaches struggle with temporal reasoning due to weak temporal correspondence in the data and reliance on the next-token prediction paradigm during training. To address these limitations, we propose TEMPLE (TEMporal Preference Learning), a systematic framework that enhances Video LLMs' temporal reasoning capabilities through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). To facilitate this, we introduce an automated preference data generation pipeline that systematically constructs preference pairs by selecting videos that are rich in temporal information, designing video-specific perturbation strategies, and finally evaluating model responses on clean and perturbed video inputs. Our temporal alignment features two key innovations: curriculum learning which that progressively increases perturbation difficulty to improve model robustness and adaptability; and "Pre-SFT Alignment'', applying preference optimization before instruction tuning to prioritize fine-grained temporal comprehension. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently improves Video LLM performance across multiple benchmarks with a relatively small set of self-generated DPO data. We further analyze the transferability of DPO data across architectures and the role of difficulty scheduling in optimization. Our findings highlight our TEMPLE as a scalable and efficient complement to SFT-based methods, paving the way for developing reliable Video LLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/lscpku/TEMPLE.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bring Remote Sensing Object Detect Into Nature Language Model: Using SFT Method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08144v2)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved significant success, demonstrating remarkable capabilities in understanding various images and videos, particularly in classification and detection tasks. However, due to the substantial differences between remote sensing images and conventional optical images, these models face considerable challenges in comprehension, especially in detection tasks. Directly prompting VLMs with detection instructions often leads to unsatisfactory results. To address this issue, this letter explores the application of VLMs for object detection in remote sensing images. Specifically, we constructed supervised fine-tuning (SFT) datasets using publicly available remote sensing object detection datasets, including SSDD, HRSID, and NWPU-VHR-10. In these new datasets, we converted annotation information into JSON-compliant natural language descriptions, facilitating more effective understanding and training for the VLM. We then evaluate the detection performance of various fine-tuning strategies for VLMs and derive optimized model weights for object detection in remote sensing images. Finally, we evaluate the model's prior knowledge capabilities using natural language queries. Experimental results demonstrate that, without modifying the model architecture, remote sensing object detection can be effectively achieved using natural language alone. Additionally, the model exhibits the ability to perform certain vision question answering (VQA) tasks. Our datasets and related code will be released soon.</p></details> |  |

However, attempts to extend this success to multimodal reasoning often failed to reproduce these key characteristics. In this report, we present the first successful replication of these emergent characteristics for multimodal reasoning on only a non-SFT 2B model. Starting with Qwen2-VL-2B and applying reinforcement learning directly on the SAT dataset, our model achieves 59.47% accuracy on CVBench, outperforming the base model by approximately ~30% and exceeding both SFT setting by ~2%. In addition, we share our failed attempts and insights in attempting to achieve R1-like reasoning using RL with instruct models. aiming to shed light on the challenges involved. Our key observations include: (1) applying RL on instruct model often results in trivial reasoning trajectories, and (2) naive length reward are ineffective in eliciting reasoning capabilities.

However, RLHF has been continuously challenged by its high complexity in implementation and computation consumption. Even with recent simplifications, such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Advantage Leftover Lunch (A-LoL), the problems of over-fitting and training instability remain hindering the alignment process from the expected optimal performance. To address the existing challenges, we propose a novel simplification of RLHF from the perspective of variational inference, called $\textbf{V}$ariational $\textbf{A}$lignment with $\textbf{R}$e-weighting ($\textbf{VAR}$). More specifically, by directly minimizing the distribution gap between the learning LLM policy and the optimal solution of RLHF, we transform the alignment objective into a reward-driven re-weighted supervised fine-tuning (SFT) form, which only requires minor adjustment on the SFT loss to obtain noticeable improvement on training stability and effectiveness. On comprehensive alignment and generation benchmarks, our VAR method has numerically achieved competitive performance in LLM alignment helpfulness and harmlessness.</p></details> |  |
| **[SFT Memorizes, RL Generalizes: A Comparative Study of Foundation Model Post-training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17161v1)** | 2025-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) are widely used post-training techniques for foundation models. However, their roles in enhancing model generalization capabilities remain unclear. This paper studies the difference between SFT and RL on generalization and memorization, focusing on text-based rule variants and visual variants. We introduce GeneralPoints, an arithmetic reasoning card game, and adopt V-IRL, a real-world navigation environment, to assess how models trained with SFT and RL generalize to unseen variants in both textual and visual domains. We show that RL, especially when trained with an outcome-based reward, generalizes across both rule-based textual and visual variants. SFT, in contrast, tends to memorize training data and struggles to generalize out-of-distribution scenarios. Further analysis reveals that RL improves the model's underlying visual recognition capabilities, contributing to its enhanced generalization in the visual domain. Despite RL's superior generalization, we show that SFT remains essential for effective RL training; SFT stabilizes the model's output format, enabling subsequent RL to achieve its performance gains. These findings demonstrates the capability of RL for acquiring generalizable knowledge in complex, multi-modal tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website at https://tianzhechu.com/SFTvsRL</p></details> |
| **[Provably Mitigating Overoptimization in RLHF: Your SFT Loss is Implicitly an Adversarial Regularizer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16436v3)** | 2024-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aligning generative models with human preference via RLHF typically suffers from overoptimization, where an imperfectly learned reward model can misguide the generative model to output undesired responses. We investigate this problem in a principled manner by identifying the source of the misalignment as a form of distributional shift and uncertainty in learning human preferences. To mitigate overoptimization, we first propose a theoretical algorithm that chooses the best policy for an adversarially chosen reward model; one that simultaneously minimizes the maximum likelihood estimation of the loss and a reward penalty term. Here, the reward penalty term is introduced to prevent the policy from choosing actions with spurious high proxy rewards, resulting in provable sample efficiency of the algorithm under a partial coverage style condition. Moving from theory to practice, the proposed algorithm further enjoys an equivalent but surprisingly easy-to-implement reformulation. Using the equivalence between reward models and the corresponding optimal policy, the algorithm features a simple objective that combines: (i) a preference optimization loss that directly aligns the policy with human preference, and (ii) a supervised learning loss that explicitly imitates the policy with a (suitable) baseline distribution. In the context of aligning large language models (LLM), this objective fuses the direct preference optimization (DPO) loss with the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) loss to help mitigate the overoptimization towards undesired responses, for which we name the algorithm Regularized Preference Optimization (RPO). Experiments of aligning LLMs demonstrate the improved performance of RPO compared with DPO baselines. Our work sheds light on the interplay between preference optimization and SFT in tuning LLMs with both theoretical guarantees and empirical evidence.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by The Thirty-Eighth Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems. 31 pages, 7 figures</p></details> |
| **[Continual SFT Matches Multimodal RLHF with Negative Supervision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14797v1)** | 2024-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal RLHF usually happens after supervised finetuning (SFT) stage to continually improve vision-language models' (VLMs) comprehension. Conventional wisdom holds its superiority over continual SFT during this preference alignment stage. In this paper, we observe that the inherent value of multimodal RLHF lies in its negative supervision, the logit of the rejected responses. We thus propose a novel negative supervised finetuning (nSFT) approach that fully excavates these information resided. Our nSFT disentangles this negative supervision in RLHF paradigm, and continually aligns VLMs with a simple SFT loss. This is more memory efficient than multimodal RLHF where 2 (e.g., DPO) or 4 (e.g., PPO) large VLMs are strictly required. The effectiveness of nSFT is rigorously proved by comparing it with various multimodal RLHF approaches, across different dataset sources, base VLMs and evaluation metrics. Besides, fruitful of ablations are provided to support our hypothesis. We hope this paper will stimulate further research to properly align large vision language models.</p></details> |  |

However, to enhance its utility and reduce potential harm, SFT and alignment are applied sequentially to the pretrained model. Due to the differing nature and objective functions of SFT and alignment, catastrophic forgetting has become a significant issue. To address this, we introduce Unified Fine-Tuning (UFT), which integrates SFT and alignment into a single training stage using the same objective and loss functions through an implicit reward function. Our experimental results demonstrate that UFT outperforms SFT on instruction-tuning data alone. Moreover, when combining instruction-tuning data with alignment data, UFT effectively prevents catastrophic forgetting across these two stages and shows a clear advantage over sequentially applying SFT and alignment. This is evident in the significant improvements observed in the \textbf{ifeval} task for instruction-following and the \textbf{truthful-qa} task for factuality. The proposed general fine-tuning framework UFT establishes an effective and efficient pretraining-UFT paradigm for LLM training.</p></details> |  |

State-of-the-art techniques such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) often consist of two stages: 1) supervised fine-tuning (SFT), where the model is fine-tuned by learning from human demonstration data; 2) Preference learning, where preference data is used to learn a reward model, which is in turn used by a reinforcement learning (RL) step to fine-tune the model. Such reward model serves as a proxy to human preference, and it is critical to guide the RL step towards improving the model quality. In this work, we argue that the SFT stage significantly benefits from learning a reward model as well. Instead of using the human demonstration data directly via supervised learning, we propose to leverage an Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) technique to simultaneously build an reward model and a policy model. This approach leads to new SFT algorithms that are not only efficient to implement, but are robust to the presence of low-quality supervised learning data. Moreover, we discover a connection between the proposed IRL based approach, and a recent line of works called Self-Play Fine-tune (SPIN). Theoretically, we show that the proposed algorithms converge to the stationary solutions of the IRL problem. Empirically, we align 1B and 7B models using proposed methods and evaluate them on a reward benchmark model and the HuggingFace Open LLM Leaderboard. The proposed methods show significant performance improvement over existing SFT approaches. Our results indicate that it is beneficial to leverage reward learning throughout the entire alignment process.</p></details> |  |

The paradigm contains supervised fine tuning and reinforce learning from human feedback. This paradigm is also used in downstream scenarios to adapt LLM to specific corpora and applications. Comparing to SFT, there are many efforts focused on RLHF and several algorithms being proposed, such as PPO, DPO, IPO, KTO, MinorDPO and etc. Meanwhile most efforts for SFT are focused on how to collect, filter and mix high quality data. In this article with insight from DPO and MinorDPO, we propose a training metric for SFT to measure the discrepancy between the optimized model and the original model, and a loss function MinorSFT that can increase the training effectiveness, and reduce the discrepancy between the optimized LLM and original LLM.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |

However, sourcing this data through human annotation is costly, and existing automated methods often fail to capture the diverse range of contextual granularity and tend to produce homogeneous data. To tackle these issues, we introduce a novel method named AugCon, capable of automatically generating context-driven SFT data across multiple levels of granularity with high diversity, quality and fidelity. AugCon begins by generating queries using the Context-Split-Tree (CST), an innovative approach for recursively deriving queries and splitting context to cover full granularity. Then, we train a scorer through contrastive learning to collaborate with CST to rank and refine queries. Finally, a synergistic integration of self-alignment and self-improving is introduced to obtain high-fidelity responses. Extensive experiments are conducted incorporating both human and automatic evaluations, encompassing a test scenario and four widely-used benchmarks in English and Chinese. The results highlight the significant advantages of AugCon in producing high diversity, quality, and fidelity SFT data against several state-of-the-art methods. All of our code, dataset, and fine-tuned model will be available at: https://github.com/quanshr/AugCon.</p></details> |  |

It typically consists of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) stages. However, RLHF faces inherent limitations stemming from a complex training setup and its tendency to align the model with implicit values that end users cannot control at run-time. Moreover, reward models in RLHF stage commonly rely on single-dimensional feedback as opposed to explicit, multifaceted signals that indicate attributes such as helpfulness, humor, and toxicity. To address these limitations, we propose SteerLM, a supervised fine-tuning method that empowers end-users to control responses during inference. SteerLM conditions responses to conform to an explicitly defined multi-dimensional set of attributes, thereby empowering a steerable AI capable of generating helpful and high-quality responses while maintaining customizability. Experiments show that SteerLM trained on open source datasets generates responses that are preferred by human and automatic evaluators to many state-of-the-art baselines trained with RLHF while being much easier to train.

However, as the number of cascades increases, the improvements in reconstruction tend to become marginal, indicating possible excess model capacity. Knowledge distillation (KD) is an emerging technique to compress these models, in which a trained deep teacher network is used to distill knowledge to a smaller student network such that the student learns to mimic the behavior of the teacher. Most KD methods focus on effectively training the student with a pre-trained teacher unaware of the student model. We propose SFT-KD-Recon, a student-friendly teacher training approach along with the student as a prior step to KD to make the teacher aware of the structure and capacity of the student and enable aligning the representations of the teacher with the student. In SFT, the teacher is jointly trained with the unfolded branch configurations of the student blocks using three loss terms - teacher-reconstruction loss, student-reconstruction loss, and teacher-student imitation loss, followed by KD of the student. We perform extensive experiments for MRI acceleration in 4x and 5x under-sampling on the brain and cardiac datasets on five KD methods using the proposed approach as a prior step. We consider the DC-CNN architecture and setup teacher as D5C5 (141765 parameters), and student as D3C5 (49285 parameters), denoting a compression of 2.87:1. Results show that (i) our approach consistently improves the KD methods with improved reconstruction performance and image quality, and (ii) the student distilled using our approach is competitive with the teacher, with the performance gap reduced from 0.53 dB to 0.03 dB.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 8 figures.

Our proof is based on a structural theorem by Whyte and on two constructions of strongly aperiodic SFTs on $\mathbb{F}_n\times \mathbb{Z}$ and $BS(m,n)$ of our own. Our two constructions rely on a path-folding technique that lifts an SFT on $\mathbb{Z}^2$ inside an SFT on $\mathbb{F}_n\times \mathbb{Z}$ or an SFT on the hyperbolic plane inside an SFT on $BS(m,n)$. In the case of $\mathbb{F}_n\times \mathbb{Z}$ the path folding technique also preserves minimality, so that we get minimal strongly aperiodic SFTs on unimodular GBS groups.</p></details> | 31 pages, 13 figures |

As a consequence, if $P$ contains a recursive member, $P$ and $X$ have the exact same set of Turing degrees. On the other hand, we prove that if $X$ contains only non-recursive members, some of its members always have different but comparable degrees.

While state-of-the-art applications like ChatGPT/GPT-4 commonly employ Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), the inclusion of a critic network introduces significant computational overhead. REINFORCE-based methods, such as REINFORCE Leave One-Out (RLOO), ReMax, and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), address this limitation by eliminating the critic network. However, these approaches face challenges in accurate advantage estimation. Specifically, they estimate advantages independently for responses to each prompt, which can lead to overfitting on simpler prompts and vulnerability to reward hacking. To address these challenges, we introduce REINFORCE++, a novel approach that removes the critic model while using the normalized reward of a batch as the baseline. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that REINFORCE++ exhibits robust performance across various reward models without requiring prompt set truncation. Furthermore, it achieves superior generalization in both RLHF and long chain-of-thought (CoT) settings compared to existing REINFORCE-based methods.

Recent advances, such as direct preference optimization (DPO), have simplified the preference learning step. However, collecting preference data remains a challenging and costly process, often requiring expert annotation. This cost can be mitigated by carefully selecting the data points presented for annotation. In this work, we propose an active learning approach to efficiently select prompt and preference pairs using a risk assessment strategy based on the Sharpe Ratio. To address the challenge of unknown preferences prior to annotation, our method evaluates the gradients of all potential preference annotations to assess their impact on model updates. These gradient-based evaluations enable risk assessment of data points regardless of the annotation outcome. By leveraging the DPO loss derivations, we derive a closed-form expression for computing these Sharpe ratios on a per-tuple basis, ensuring our approach remains both tractable and computationally efficient. We also introduce two variants of our method, each making different assumptions about prior information. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the baseline by up to 5% in win rates against the chosen completion with limited human preference data across several language models and real-world datasets.</p></details> |  |

We begin with a concise overview of the typical steps involved in RLHF and LRMs. Next, we reinterpret several RL-based and RL-free algorithms through the perspective of neural structured bandit prediction, providing a clear conceptual framework that uncovers a deeper connection between these seemingly distinct approaches. Following this, we briefly review some core principles of reinforcement learning, drawing attention to an often-overlooked aspect in existing RLHF studies. This leads to a detailed derivation of the standard RLHF objective within a full RL context, demonstrating its equivalence to neural structured bandit prediction. Finally, by reinvestigating the principles behind Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), we pinpoint areas needing adjustment, which culminates in the introduction of the Generalized Reinforce Optimization (GRO) framework, seamlessly integrating RL-based and RL-free methods in RLHF. We look forward to the community's efforts to empirically validate GRO and invite constructive feedback.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Shared Low-Rank Adaptation Approach to Personalized RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19201v1)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a pivotal technique for aligning artificial intelligence systems with human values, achieving remarkable success in fine-tuning large language models. However, existing RLHF frameworks often assume that human preferences are relatively homogeneous and can be captured by a single, unified reward model. This assumption overlooks the inherent diversity and heterogeneity across individuals, limiting the adaptability of RLHF to personalized scenarios and risking misalignments that can diminish user satisfaction and trust in AI systems. In this paper, we address these challenges by introducing Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) into the personalized RLHF framework. We apply LoRA in the the aggregated parameter space of all personalized reward functions, thereby enabling efficient learning of personalized reward models from potentially limited local datasets. Our approach exploits potential shared structures among the local ground-truth reward models while allowing for individual adaptation, without relying on restrictive assumptions about shared representations as in prior works. We further establish sample complexity guarantees for our method. Theoretical analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach in capturing both shared and individual-specific structures within heterogeneous human preferences, addressing the dual challenge of personalization requirements and practical data constraints. Experimental results on real-world datasets corroborate the efficiency of our algorithm in the personalized RLHF setting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at AISTATS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Mitigating Reward Over-Optimization in RLHF via Behavior-Supported Regularization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18130v1)** | 2025-03-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is an effective method for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values. However, reward over-optimization remains an open challenge leading to discrepancies between the performance of LLMs under the reward model and the true human objectives. A primary contributor to reward over-optimization is the extrapolation error that arises when the reward model evaluates out-of-distribution (OOD) responses. However, current methods still fail to prevent the increasing frequency of OOD response generation during the reinforcement learning (RL) process and are not effective at handling extrapolation errors from OOD responses. In this work, we propose the Behavior-Supported Policy Optimization (BSPO) method to mitigate the reward over-optimization issue. Specifically, we define behavior policy as the next token distribution of the reward training dataset to model the in-distribution (ID) region of the reward model. Building on this, we introduce the behavior-supported Bellman operator to regularize the value function, penalizing all OOD values without impacting the ID ones. Consequently, BSPO reduces the generation of OOD responses during the RL process, thereby avoiding overestimation caused by the reward model's extrapolation errors. Theoretically, we prove that BSPO guarantees a monotonic improvement of the supported policy until convergence to the optimal behavior-supported policy. Empirical results from extensive experiments show that BSPO outperforms baselines in preventing reward over-optimization due to OOD evaluation and finding the optimal ID policy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Understanding the Effects of RLHF on the Quality and Detectability of LLM-Generated Texts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17965v1)** | 2025-03-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance on a range of downstream NLP tasks by generating text that closely resembles human writing. However, the ease of achieving this similarity raises concerns from potential malicious uses at scale by bad actors, as LLM-generated text becomes increasingly difficult to discern from human text. Although detection methods have been developed to address this issue, bad actors can further manipulate LLM-generated texts to make them less detectable. In this work, we study how further editing texts with Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), which aligns model outputs with human preferences, affects (a) the quality of generated texts for two tasks, and (b) the performance of LLM-generated text detectors, looking at both training-based and zero-shot detection methods. Although RLHF improves the quality of LLM-generated texts, we find that it also tends to produce more detectable, lengthy, and repetitive outputs. Additionally, we observe that training-based detectors are vulnerable to short texts and to texts that incorporate code, whereas zero-shot detectors exhibit greater robustness.</p></details> | 14 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Asynchronous RLHF: Faster and More Efficient Off-Policy RL for Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18252v2)** | 2025-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The dominant paradigm for RLHF is online and on-policy RL: synchronously generating from the large language model (LLM) policy, labelling with a reward model, and learning using feedback on the LLM's own outputs. While performant, this paradigm is computationally inefficient. Inspired by classical deep RL literature, we propose separating generation and learning in RLHF. This enables asynchronous generation of new samples while simultaneously training on old samples, leading to faster training and more compute-optimal scaling. However, asynchronous training relies on an underexplored regime, online but off-policy RLHF: learning on samples from previous iterations of our model which give a worse training signal. We tackle the fundamental challenge in this regime: how much off-policyness can we tolerate for asynchronous training to speed up learning but maintain performance? Among several RLHF algorithms we test, online DPO is found to be most robust to off-policy data, and robustness increases with the scale of the policy model. We study further compute optimizations for asynchronous RLHF but find that they come at a performance cost, giving rise to a trade-off. We verify the scalability of asynchronous RLHF by training a general-purpose chatbot from LLaMA 3.1 8B on an instruction-following task ~40% faster than a synchronous run while matching final performance. Finally, we extend our results to math and reasoning to demonstrate asynchronous RL can finetune Rho 1B on GSM8k ~70% faster while matching synchronous accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>code ...</summary><p>code at https://github.com/mnoukhov/async_rlhf</p></details> |
| **[Aligning to What? Limits to RLHF Based Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09025v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is increasingly used to align large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. However, the effectiveness of RLHF in addressing underlying biases remains unclear. This study investigates the relationship between RLHF and both covert and overt biases in LLMs, particularly focusing on biases against African Americans. We applied various RLHF techniques (DPO, ORPO, and RLOO) to Llama 3 8B and evaluated the covert and overt biases of the resulting models using matched-guise probing and explicit bias testing. We performed additional tests with DPO on different base models and datasets; among several implications, we found that SFT before RLHF calcifies model biases. Additionally, we extend the tools for measuring biases to multi-modal models. Through our experiments we collect evidence that indicates that current alignment techniques are inadequate for nebulous tasks such as mitigating covert biases, highlighting the need for capable datasets, data curating techniques, or alignment tools.</p></details> |  |
| **[ROCM: RLHF on consistency models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06171v1)** | 2025-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have revolutionized generative modeling in continuous domains like image, audio, and video synthesis. However, their iterative sampling process leads to slow generation and inefficient training, challenges that are further exacerbated when incorporating Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) due to sparse rewards and long time horizons. Consistency models address these issues by enabling single-step or efficient multi-step generation, significantly reducing computational costs. In this work, we propose a direct reward optimization framework for applying RLHF to consistency models, incorporating distributional regularization to enhance training stability and prevent reward hacking. We investigate various $f$-divergences as regularization strategies, striking a balance between reward maximization and model consistency. Unlike policy gradient methods, our approach leverages first-order gradients, making it more efficient and less sensitive to hyperparameter tuning. Empirical results show that our method achieves competitive or superior performance compared to policy gradient based RLHF methods, across various automatic metrics and human evaluation. Additionally, our analysis demonstrates the impact of different regularization techniques in improving model generalization and preventing overfitting.</p></details> |  |
| **[On a Connection Between Imitation Learning and RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05079v1)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work studies the alignment of large language models with preference data from an imitation learning perspective. We establish a close theoretical connection between reinforcement learning from human feedback RLHF and imitation learning (IL), revealing that RLHF implicitly performs imitation learning on the preference data distribution. Building on this connection, we propose DIL, a principled framework that directly optimizes the imitation learning objective. DIL provides a unified imitation learning perspective on alignment, encompassing existing alignment algorithms as special cases while naturally introducing new variants. By bridging IL and RLHF, DIL offers new insights into alignment with RLHF. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DIL outperforms existing methods on various challenging benchmarks.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |
| **[LLM Misalignment via Adversarial RLHF Platforms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03039v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning has shown remarkable performance in aligning language models with human preferences, leading to the rise of attention towards developing RLHF platforms. These platforms enable users to fine-tune models without requiring any expertise in developing complex machine learning algorithms. While these platforms offer useful features such as reward modeling and RLHF fine-tuning, their security and reliability remain largely unexplored. Given the growing adoption of RLHF and open-source RLHF frameworks, we investigate the trustworthiness of these systems and their potential impact on behavior of LLMs. In this paper, we present an attack targeting publicly available RLHF tools. In our proposed attack, an adversarial RLHF platform corrupts the LLM alignment process by selectively manipulating data samples in the preference dataset. In this scenario, when a user's task aligns with the attacker's objective, the platform manipulates a subset of the preference dataset that contains samples related to the attacker's target. This manipulation results in a corrupted reward model, which ultimately leads to the misalignment of the language model. Our results demonstrate that such an attack can effectively steer LLMs toward undesirable behaviors within the targeted domains. Our work highlights the critical need to explore the vulnerabilities of RLHF platforms and their potential to cause misalignment in LLMs during the RLHF fine-tuning process.</p></details> |  |
| **[Taming Overconfidence in LLMs: Reward Calibration in RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09724v2)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language model calibration refers to the alignment between the confidence of the model and the actual performance of its responses. While previous studies point out the overconfidence phenomenon in Large Language Models (LLMs) and show that LLMs trained with Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) are overconfident with a more sharpened output probability, in this study, we reveal that RLHF tends to lead models to express verbalized overconfidence in their own responses. We investigate the underlying cause of this overconfidence and demonstrate that reward models used for Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) exhibit inherent biases towards high-confidence scores regardless of the actual quality of responses. Building upon this insight, we propose two PPO variants: PPO-M: PPO with Calibrated Reward Modeling and PPO-C: PPO with Calibrated Reward Calculation. PPO-M integrates explicit confidence scores in reward model training, which calibrates reward models to better capture the alignment between response quality and verbalized confidence. PPO-C adjusts the reward score during PPO based on the difference between the current reward and the exponential average of past rewards. Both PPO-M and PPO-C can be seamlessly integrated into the current PPO pipeline and do not require additional golden labels. We evaluate our methods on both Llama3-8B and Mistral-7B across six diverse datasets including multiple-choice and open-ended generation. Experimental results demonstrate that both of our methods can reduce calibration error and maintain performance comparable to standard PPO. We further show that they could preserve model capabilities in open-ended conversational settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reward Shaping to Mitigate Reward Hacking in RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18770v2)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is essential for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values. However, RLHF is susceptible to reward hacking, where the agent exploits flaws in the reward function rather than learning the intended behavior, thus degrading alignment. While reward shaping helps stabilize RLHF and partially mitigate reward hacking, a systematic investigation into shaping techniques and their underlying principles remains lacking. To bridge this gap, we present a comprehensive study of the prevalent reward shaping methods. Our analysis suggests three key design principles: (1) RL reward is ideally bounded, (2) RL benefits from rapid initial growth followed by gradual convergence, and (3) RL reward is best formulated as a function of centered reward. Guided by these insights, we propose Preference As Reward (PAR), a novel approach that leverages the latent preferences embedded within the reward model itself as the signal for reinforcement learning. We evaluated PAR on two base models, Gemma2-2B and Llama3-8B, using two datasets, Ultrafeedback-Binarized and HH-RLHF. Experimental results demonstrate PAR's superior performance over other reward shaping methods. On the AlpacaEval 2.0 benchmark, PAR achieves a win rate at least 5 percentage points higher than competing approaches. Furthermore, PAR exhibits remarkable data efficiency, requiring only a single reference reward for optimal performance, and maintains robustness against reward hacking even after two full epochs of training. Code is available at https://github.com/PorUna-byte/PAR.</p></details> | 19 pages |
| **[Can RLHF be More Efficient with Imperfect Reward Models? A Policy Coverage Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19255v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sample efficiency is critical for online Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). While existing works investigate sample-efficient online exploration strategies, the potential of utilizing misspecified yet relevant reward models to accelerate learning remains underexplored. This paper studies how to transfer knowledge from those imperfect reward models in online RLHF. We start by identifying a novel property of the KL-regularized RLHF objective: \emph{a policy's ability to cover the optimal policy is captured by its sub-optimality}. Building on this insight, we propose a theoretical transfer learning algorithm with provable benefits compared to standard online learning. Our approach achieves low regret in the early stage by quickly adapting to the best available source reward models without prior knowledge of their quality, and over time, it attains an $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret bound \emph{independent} of structural complexity measures. Inspired by our theoretical findings, we develop an empirical algorithm with improved computational efficiency, and demonstrate its effectiveness empirically in summarization tasks.</p></details> | 35 Pages |
| **[Evaluating Defences against Unsafe Feedback in RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12914v3)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While there has been progress towards aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human values and ensuring safe behaviour at inference time, safety guards can easily be removed when fine tuned on unsafe and harmful datasets. While this setting has been treated extensively, another popular training paradigm, learning from unsafe feedback with reinforcement learning, has previously been unexplored. This is concerning due to the widespread deployment of feedback collection systems. We address this gap by providing an analysis of learning settings where feedback is harmful, i.e. that unsafe samples are preferred over safe ones despite model developers goal to maintain safety. We find that safety-aligned LLMs easily explore unsafe action spaces via generating harmful text and optimize for reward that violates safety constraints indicating that current safety guards are not enough to prevent learning from unsafe feedback. In order to protect against this vulnerability, we adapt a number of both "implict" and "explicit" harmful fine-tuning defences to evaluate whether they are effective as learning constraints in an RLHF setting finding that no method is generally effective pointing to the need for more defence research. We end the paper with the observation that some defences work by performing "harmless reward hacking" for which we provide a theoretical explanation drawn from the theory of Constrained Markov Decision Processes and provide some direction for future defence development.</p></details> |  |
| **[Projection Optimization: A General Framework for Multi-Objective and Multi-Group RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15145v2)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) is a widely used fine-tuning approach that aligns machine learning model, particularly Language Model (LM) with human preferences. There are typically multiple objectives driving the preference, hence humans find it easier to express per-objective comparisons rather than a global preference between two choices. Multi-Objective RLHF (MORLHF) aims to use per-objective preference feedback and achieve Pareto optimality among these objectives by aggregating them into a single unified objective for optimization. However, nearly all prior works rely on linear aggregation, which rules out policies that favor specific objectives such as the worst one. The only existing approach using non-linear aggregation is computationally expensive due to its reward-based nature and the need for retraining whenever the aggregation parameters change. In this work, we address this limitation by transforming the non-linear aggregation maximization problem into a series of sub-problems. Each sub-problem involves only linear aggregation, making it computationally efficient to solve. We further extend our framework to handle multi-group scenarios, where each group has distinct weights for the objectives. Our method enables achieving consensus or maximizing the aggregated objective across all groups. Theoretically, we demonstrate that our algorithmic framework achieves sublinear regret and can be easily adapted to a reward-free algorithm. Empirically, leveraging our theoretical insights, we propose a nearly training-free algorithm once the optimal policies for individual objectives are obtained.</p></details> |  |
| **[Simplify RLHF as Reward-Weighted SFT: A Variational Method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11026v2)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is crucial for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human values. However, RLHF has been continuously challenged by its high complexity in implementation and computation consumption. Even with recent simplifications, such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Advantage Leftover Lunch (A-LoL), the problems of over-fitting and training instability remain hindering the alignment process from the expected optimal performance. To address the existing challenges, we propose a novel simplification of RLHF from the perspective of variational inference, called $\textbf{V}$ariational $\textbf{A}$lignment with $\textbf{R}$e-weighting ($\textbf{VAR}$). More specifically, by directly minimizing the distribution gap between the learning LLM policy and the optimal solution of RLHF, we transform the alignment objective into a reward-driven re-weighted supervised fine-tuning (SFT) form, which only requires minor adjustment on the SFT loss to obtain noticeable improvement on training stability and effectiveness. On comprehensive alignment and generation benchmarks, our VAR method has numerically achieved competitive performance in LLM alignment helpfulness and harmlessness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Value-Incentivized Preference Optimization: A Unified Approach to Online and Offline RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19320v4)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has demonstrated great promise in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preference. Depending on the availability of preference data, both online and offline RLHF are active areas of investigation. A key bottleneck is understanding how to incorporate uncertainty estimation in the reward function learned from the preference data for RLHF, regardless of how the preference data is collected. While the principles of optimism or pessimism under uncertainty are well-established in standard reinforcement learning (RL), a practically-implementable and theoretically-grounded form amenable to large language models is not yet available, as standard techniques for constructing confidence intervals become intractable under arbitrary policy parameterizations. In this paper, we introduce a unified approach to online and offline RLHF -- value-incentivized preference optimization (VPO) -- which regularizes the maximum-likelihood estimate of the reward function with the corresponding value function, modulated by a $\textit{sign}$ to indicate whether the optimism or pessimism is chosen. VPO also directly optimizes the policy with implicit reward modeling, and therefore shares a simpler RLHF pipeline similar to direct preference optimization. Theoretical guarantees of VPO are provided for both online and offline settings, matching the rates of their standard RL counterparts. Moreover, experiments on text summarization and dialog verify the practicality and effectiveness of VPO.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

It has been shown to enhance both generation quality and trustworthiness. While numerous works have focused on improving retrieval, generation, and evaluation, the role of reward models in reinforcement learning for optimizing RAG remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{RAG-Reward}, a framework designed to develop reward models to enable \textit{hallucination-free, comprehensive, reliable, and efficient RAG}. We define four key metrics to assess generation quality and develop an automated benchmarking pipeline to evaluate the outputs of multiple LLMs across a variety of RAG scenarios. Using \textbf{RAG-Reward}, we train reward models and apply {reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF)} to improve LLMs' effectiveness in RAG. Experimental results demonstrate that our reward model achieves state-of-the-art performance in automatic benchmarking and aligns closely with human evaluations. Furthermore, the improved generation quality of the trained policy model highlights the feasibility and efficiency of using RLHF to enhance RAG outputs.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Equilibrate RLHF: Towards Balancing Helpfulness-Safety Trade-off in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11555v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) based on human preferences, commonly achieved through reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), has been effective in improving their performance. However, maintaining LLM safety throughout the fine-tuning process remains a significant challenge, as resolving conflicts between safety and helpfulness can be non-trivial. Typically, the safety alignment of LLM is trained on data with safety-related categories. However, our experiments find that naively increasing the scale of safety training data usually leads the LLMs to an ``overly safe'' state rather than a ``truly safe'' state, boosting the refusal rate through extensive safety-aligned data without genuinely understanding the requirements for safe responses. Such an approach can inadvertently diminish the models' helpfulness. To understand the phenomenon, we first investigate the role of safety data by categorizing them into three different groups, and observe that each group behaves differently as training data scales up. To boost the balance between safety and helpfulness, we propose an Equilibrate RLHF framework including a Fine-grained Data-centric (FDC) approach that achieves better safety alignment even with fewer training data, and an Adaptive Message-wise Alignment (AMA) approach, which selectively highlight the key segments through a gradient masking strategy. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances the safety alignment of LLMs while balancing safety and helpfulness.</p></details> |  |
| **[DPO Meets PPO: Reinforced Token Optimization for RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18922v3)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the classical Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) framework, Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is employed to learn from sparse, sentence-level rewards -- a challenging scenario in traditional deep reinforcement learning. Despite the great successes of PPO in the alignment of large language models, its open-source implementation is still largely sub-optimal. To address these issues, we introduce a framework that models RLHF problems as a Markov decision process (MDP), enabling the capture of fine-grained token-wise information. Under this framework, we introduce an algorithm Reinforced Token Optimization (\texttt{RTO}), which learns the token-wise reward function from preference data and performs policy optimization based on this learned token-wise reward signal. Theoretically, \texttt{RTO} is proven to have the capability of finding the near-optimal policy sample-efficiently. For its practical implementation, \texttt{RTO} innovatively integrates Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and PPO. DPO, originally derived from sparse sentence rewards, surprisingly provides us with a token-wise characterization of response quality, which is seamlessly incorporated into our subsequent PPO training stage. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \texttt{RTO} performs better than PPO and other direct preference learning algorithms. In particular, RTO outperforms PPO by 7.5 points on the AlpacaEval 2 benchmark and by 4.1 points on Arena-Hard. Our code and models are available at \href{https://github.com/zkshan2002/RTO}{https://github.com/zkshan2002/RTO}.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sharp Analysis for KL-Regularized Contextual Bandits and RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04625v2)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reverse-Kullback-Leibler (KL) regularization has emerged to be a predominant technique used to enhance policy optimization in reinforcement learning (RL) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), which forces the learned policy to stay close to a reference policy. While the effectiveness and necessity of KL-regularization have been empirically demonstrated in various practical scenarios, current theoretical analysis of KL-regularized RLHF still obtains the same $\mathcal{O}(1 / \epsilon^2)$ sample complexity as problems without KL-regularization. To understand the fundamental distinction between policy learning objectives with KL-regularization and ones without KL-regularization, we are the first to theoretically demonstrate the power of KL-regularization by providing a sharp analysis for KL-regularized contextual bandits and RLHF, revealing an $\mathcal{O}(1 / \epsilon)$ sample complexity when $\epsilon$ is sufficiently small. We further explore the role of data coverage in contextual bandits and RLHF. While the coverage assumption is commonly employed in offline RLHF to link the samples from the reference policy to the optimal policy, often at the cost of a multiplicative dependence on the coverage coefficient, its impact on the sample complexity of online RLHF remains unclear. Previous theoretical analyses of online RLHF typically require explicit exploration and additional structural assumptions on the reward function class. In contrast, we show that with sufficient coverage from the reference policy, a simple two-stage mixed sampling strategy can achieve a sample complexity with only an additive dependence on the coverage coefficient. Our results provide a comprehensive understanding of the roles of KL-regularization and data coverage in RLHF, shedding light on the design of more efficient RLHF algorithms.</p></details> |  |

While recent advancements have provided valuable insights into various stages and settings of RLHF, a comprehensive theoretical understanding of the entire RLHF pipeline remains lacking. Towards this end, we propose a unified framework for the RLHF pipeline from the view of contextual bandits and provide provable efficiency guarantees. In particular, we decompose the RLHF process into two distinct stages: (post-)training and deployment, exploring both passive and active data collection strategies during the training phase. By employing the Bradley-Terry preference model with a linearly parameterized reward function, we reformulate RLHF as a contextual preference bandit problem. We then develop novel algorithms for each stage, demonstrating significant improvements over existing approaches in both statistical and computational efficiency. Finally, we apply our method to train and deploy Llama-3-8B-Instruct on the Ultrafeedback-binarized dataset, and empirical results confirm the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[RLHS: Mitigating Misalignment in RLHF with Hindsight Simulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08617v2)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has shown promise in aligning generative AI, we present empirical evidence that it can also cause severe, systematic misalignment. We hypothesize that this stems from evaluator feedback depending on downstream outcome predictions (foresight) that can be influenced by the AI's output, inducing Goodhart's law dynamics. Conversely, our theoretical analysis shows that conditioning evaluator feedback on downstream observations (hindsight) inhibits this effect by decoupling the alignment signal from potentially compromised predictions-crucially, the result holds even if the observed outcomes are sampled from the AI's own world model. Building on this insight, we introduce Reinforcement Learning from Hindsight Simulation (RLHS), which presents plausible simulated outcomes to evaluators before eliciting feedback. We demonstrate RLHS on online (PPO) and offline (DPO) large language model fine-tuning, obtaining superior alignment over RLHF in controlled consultancy-type experiments and user studies. We evaluate post-hoc on the TruthfulQA benchmark and find that, even after single-task fine-tuning, both RLHF misalignment and RLHS alignment carry over to substantially different settings.</p></details> | 24 pages, 18 figures |
| **[Avoiding $\mathbf{exp(R_{max})}$ scaling in RLHF through Preference-based Exploration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00666v2)** | 2025-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a pivotal technique for large language model (LLM) alignment. This paper studies the setting of online RLHF and focus on improving sample efficiency. All existing algorithms in online RLHF, whether doing passive exploration or active exploration, suffer from a sample complexity that scales exponentially with the scale of the reward function. This fundamental limitation hinders their effectiveness in scenarios with heavily skewed preferences, e.g. questions with a unique correct solution. To address this, we introduce Self-Exploring Preference-Incentive Online Preference Optimization (SE-POPO), an online RLHF algorithm that for the first time achieves a sample complexity that scales polynomially with the reward scale, answering an open problem raised by Xie et al. (2024).. Theoretically, we demonstrate that the sample complexity of SE-POPO dominates that of existing exploration algorithms. Empirically, our systematic evaluation confirms that SE-POPO is more sample-efficient than both exploratory and non-exploratory baselines, in two primary application scenarios of RLHF as well as on public benchmarks, marking a significant step forward in RLHF algorithm design. The code is available at https://github.com/MYC000801/SE-POPO.</p></details> |  |
| **[Influencing Humans to Conform to Preference Models for RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06416v2)** | 2025-02-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Designing a reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) algorithm to approximate a human's unobservable reward function requires assuming, implicitly or explicitly, a model of human preferences. A preference model that poorly describes how humans generate preferences risks learning a poor approximation of the human's reward function. In this paper, we conduct three human studies to asses whether one can influence the expression of real human preferences to more closely conform to a desired preference model. Importantly, our approach does not seek to alter the human's unobserved reward function. Rather, we change how humans use this reward function to generate preferences, such that they better match whatever preference model is assumed by a particular RLHF algorithm. We introduce three interventions: showing humans the quantities that underlie a preference model, which is normally unobservable information derived from the reward function; training people to follow a specific preference model; and modifying the preference elicitation question. All intervention types show significant effects, providing practical tools to improve preference data quality and the resultant alignment of the learned reward functions. Overall we establish a novel research direction in model alignment: designing interfaces and training interventions to increase human conformance with the modeling assumptions of the algorithm that will learn from their input.</p></details> |  |

We introduce Federated Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (FedRLHF), a novel framework that decentralizes the RLHF process. FedRLHF enables collaborative policy learning across multiple clients without necessitating the sharing of raw data or human feedback, thereby ensuring robust privacy preservation. Leveraging federated reinforcement learning, each client integrates human feedback locally into their reward functions and updates their policies through personalized RLHF processes. We establish rigorous theoretical foundations for FedRLHF, providing convergence guarantees, and deriving sample complexity bounds that scale efficiently with the number of clients. Empirical evaluations on the MovieLens and IMDb datasets demonstrate that FedRLHF not only preserves user privacy but also achieves performance on par with centralized RLHF, while enhancing personalization across diverse client environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Updated for AAMAS 2025 camera-ready.

Specifically, energy loss in the final layer of a Large Language Model (LLM) gradually increases during the RL process, with an excessive increase in energy loss characterizing reward hacking. Beyond empirical analysis, we further provide a theoretical foundation by proving that, under mild conditions, the increased energy loss reduces the upper bound of contextual relevance in LLMs, which is a critical aspect of reward hacking as the reduced contextual relevance typically indicates overfitting to reward model-favored patterns in RL. To address this issue, we propose an Energy loss-aware PPO algorithm (EPPO) which penalizes the increase in energy loss in the LLM's final layer during reward calculation to prevent excessive energy loss, thereby mitigating reward hacking. We theoretically show that EPPO can be conceptually interpreted as an entropy-regularized RL algorithm, which provides deeper insights into its effectiveness. Extensive experiments across various LLMs and tasks demonstrate the commonality of the energy loss phenomenon, as well as the effectiveness of EPPO in mitigating reward hacking and improving RLHF performance.</p></details> | 28 pages, 21 figures |
| **[Theoretical Analysis of KL-regularized RLHF with Multiple Reference Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01203v1)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent methods for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human feedback predominantly rely on a single reference model, which limits diversity, model overfitting, and underutilizes the wide range of available pre-trained models. Incorporating multiple reference models has the potential to address these limitations by broadening perspectives, reducing bias, and leveraging the strengths of diverse open-source LLMs. However, integrating multiple reference models into reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) frameworks poses significant theoretical challenges, particularly in reverse KL-regularization, where achieving exact solutions has remained an open problem. This paper presents the first \emph{exact solution} to the multiple reference model problem in reverse KL-regularized RLHF. We introduce a comprehensive theoretical framework that includes rigorous statistical analysis and provides sample complexity guarantees. Additionally, we extend our analysis to forward KL-regularized RLHF, offering new insights into sample complexity requirements in multiple reference scenarios. Our contributions lay the foundation for more advanced and adaptable LLM alignment techniques, enabling the effective use of multiple reference models. This work paves the way for developing alignment frameworks that are both theoretically sound and better suited to the challenges of modern AI ecosystems.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[Towards Federated RLHF with Aggregated Client Preference for LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03038v2)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) fine-tunes a pretrained large language model (LLM) using user preference data, enabling it to generate content aligned with human preferences. However, due to privacy concerns, users may be reluctant to share sensitive preference data. To address this, we propose utilizing Federated Learning (FL) techniques, allowing large-scale preference collection from diverse real-world users without requiring them to transmit data to a central server. Our federated RLHF methods (i.e., FedBis and FedBiscuit) encode each client's preferences into binary selectors and aggregate them to capture common preferences. In particular, FedBiscuit overcomes key challenges, such as preference heterogeneity and reward hacking, through innovative solutions like grouping clients with similar preferences to reduce heterogeneity and using multiple binary selectors to enhance LLM output quality. To evaluate the performance of the proposed methods, we establish the first federated RLHF benchmark with a heterogeneous human preference dataset. Experimental results show that by integrating the LLM with aggregated client preferences, FedBis and FedBiscuit significantly enhance the professionalism and readability of the generated content.</p></details> | ICLR'25 |
| **[Segmenting Text and Learning Their Rewards for Improved RLHF in Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02790v1)** | 2025-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has been widely adopted to align language models (LMs) with human preference. Prior RLHF works typically take a bandit formulation, which, though intuitive, ignores the sequential nature of LM generation and can suffer from the sparse reward issue. While recent works propose dense token-level RLHF, treating each token as an action may be oversubtle to proper reward assignment. In this paper, we seek to get the best of both by training and utilizing a segment-level reward model, which assigns a reward to each semantically complete text segment that spans over a short sequence of tokens. For reward learning, our method allows dynamic text segmentation and compatibility with standard sequence-preference datasets. For effective RL-based LM training against segment reward, we generalize the classical scalar bandit reward normalizers into location-aware normalizer functions and interpolate the segment reward for further densification. With these designs, our method performs competitively on three popular RLHF benchmarks for LM policy: AlpacaEval 2.0, Arena-Hard, and MT-Bench. Ablation studies are conducted to further demonstrate our method.</p></details> |  |

Automatic Analysis of Refusal Composition in IFT/RLHF Datasets and Refusal Behavior of Black-Box LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16974v1)** | 2024-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Refusals - instances where large language models (LLMs) decline or fail to fully execute user instructions - are crucial for both AI safety and AI capabilities and the reduction of hallucinations in particular. These behaviors are learned during post-training, especially in instruction fine-tuning (IFT) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). However, existing taxonomies and evaluation datasets for refusals are inadequate, often focusing solely on should-not-related (instead of cannot-related) categories, and lacking tools for auditing refusal content in black-box LLM outputs. We present a comprehensive framework for classifying LLM refusals: (a) a taxonomy of 16 refusal categories, (b) a human-annotated dataset of over 8,600 instances from publicly available IFT and RLHF datasets, (c) a synthetic dataset with 8,000 examples for each refusal category, and (d) classifiers trained for refusal classification. Our work enables precise auditing of refusal behaviors in black-box LLMs and automatic analyses of refusal patterns in large IFT and RLHF datasets. This facilitates the strategic adjustment of LLM refusals, contributing to the development of more safe and reliable LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024 Workshop SFLLM</p></details> |
| **[More RLHF, More Trust? On The Impact of Preference Alignment On Trustworthiness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18870v2)** | 2024-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The trustworthiness of Large Language Models (LLMs) refers to the extent to which their outputs are reliable, safe, and ethically aligned, and it has become a crucial consideration alongside their cognitive performance. In practice, Reinforcement Learning From Human Feedback (RLHF) has been widely used to align LLMs with labeled human preferences, but its assumed effect on model trustworthiness hasn't been rigorously evaluated. To bridge this knowledge gap, this study investigates how models aligned with general-purpose preference data perform across five trustworthiness verticals: toxicity, stereotypical bias, machine ethics, truthfulness, and privacy. Our results demonstrate that RLHF on human preferences doesn't automatically guarantee trustworthiness, and reverse effects are often observed. Furthermore, we propose to adapt efficient influence function based data attribution methods to the RLHF setting to better understand the influence of fine-tuning data on individual trustworthiness benchmarks, and show its feasibility by providing our estimated attribution scores. Together, our results underscore the need for more nuanced approaches for model alignment from both the data and framework perspectives, and we hope this research will guide the community towards developing language models that are increasingly capable without sacrificing trustworthiness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Solving the Inverse Alignment Problem for Efficient RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10529v1)** | 2024-12-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Collecting high-quality preference datasets for reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is resource-intensive and challenging. As a result, researchers often train reward models on extensive offline datasets which aggregate diverse generation sources and scoring/alignment policies. We hypothesize that this aggregation has an averaging effect on reward model scores, which limits signal and impairs the alignment process. Inspired by the field of inverse RL, we define the 'inverse alignment problem' in language model training, where our objective is to optimize the critic's reward for a fixed actor and a fixed offline preference dataset. We hypothesize that solving the inverse alignment problem will improve reward model quality by providing clearer feedback on the policy's current behavior. To that end, we investigate whether repeatedly fine-tuning a reward model on subsets of the offline preference dataset aligned with a periodically frozen policy during RLHF improves upon vanilla RLHF. Our empirical results demonstrate that this approach facilitates superior alignment and faster convergence compared to using an unaligned or out-of-distribution reward model relative to the LLM policy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Policy Filtration in RLHF to Fine-Tune LLM for Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06957v2)** | 2024-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is one of the key techniques that helps large language models (LLMs) to follow instructions and provide helpful and harmless responses. While direct policy optimization methods exist, state-of-the-art LLMs adopt RL-based methods (usually PPO) in RLHF to train the policy to generate good responses guided by a reward model learned from preference data. The main challenge of these methods is the inaccuracy of the intermediate reward model, especially in code generation tasks that require long and complex reasoning to score a response. We find that the reliability of the reward model varies across responses assigned with different rewards. This motivates us to filter the samples whose rewards may be unreliable to improve signal-to-noise ratio during policy learning, resulting in Policy Filtration for Proximal Policy Optimization (PF-PPO). To choose a proper policy filtration strategy for a given reward model, the coefficient of determination ($R^2$) between rewards and actual scores on filtered samples serves as a good metrics and helps us find several promising strategies. We provide extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of PF-PPO in code generation tasks, and find that some variants of PF-PPO are highly effective and achieve new state-of-the-art performance across 7-billion-parameter models on HumanEval, MBPP, and a new and more challenging LeetCode Contest benchmark.</p></details> |  |
| **[Does RLHF Scale? Exploring the Impacts From Data, Model, and Method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06000v1)** | 2024-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study explores the scaling properties of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) in Large Language Models (LLMs). Although RLHF is considered an important step in post-training of LLMs, its scaling potential is still largely unknown. We systematically analyze key components in the RLHF framework--model size, data composition, and inference budget--and their impacts on performance. Our findings show that increasing data diversity and volume improves reward model performance, helping process-supervision models scale better. For policy training, more response samples per prompt boost performance initially but quickly plateau. And larger reward models offer modest gains in policy training. In addition, larger policy models benefit less from RLHF with a fixed reward model. Overall, RLHF scales less efficiently than pretraining, with diminishing returns from additional computational resources. Based on these observations, we propose strategies to optimize RLHF performance within computational limits.</p></details> |  |
| **[Language Models Learn to Mislead Humans via RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12822v3)** | 2024-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language models (LMs) can produce errors that are hard to detect for humans, especially when the task is complex. RLHF, the most popular post-training method, may exacerbate this problem: to achieve higher rewards, LMs might get better at convincing humans that they are right even when they are wrong. We study this phenomenon under a standard RLHF pipeline, calling it "U-SOPHISTRY" since it is Unintended by model developers. Specifically, we ask time-constrained (e.g., 3-10 minutes) human subjects to evaluate the correctness of model outputs and calculate humans' accuracy against gold labels. On a question-answering task (QuALITY) and programming task (APPS), RLHF makes LMs better at convincing our subjects but not at completing the task correctly. RLHF also makes the model harder to evaluate: our subjects' false positive rate increases by 24.1% on QuALITY and 18.3% on APPS. Finally, we show that probing, a state-of-the-art approach for detecting Intended Sophistry (e.g. backdoored LMs), does not generalize to U-SOPHISTRY. Our results highlight an important failure mode of RLHF and call for more research in assisting humans to align them.</p></details> |  |
| **[Provably Mitigating Overoptimization in RLHF: Your SFT Loss is Implicitly an Adversarial Regularizer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16436v3)** | 2024-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aligning generative models with human preference via RLHF typically suffers from overoptimization, where an imperfectly learned reward model can misguide the generative model to output undesired responses. We investigate this problem in a principled manner by identifying the source of the misalignment as a form of distributional shift and uncertainty in learning human preferences. To mitigate overoptimization, we first propose a theoretical algorithm that chooses the best policy for an adversarially chosen reward model; one that simultaneously minimizes the maximum likelihood estimation of the loss and a reward penalty term. Here, the reward penalty term is introduced to prevent the policy from choosing actions with spurious high proxy rewards, resulting in provable sample efficiency of the algorithm under a partial coverage style condition. Moving from theory to practice, the proposed algorithm further enjoys an equivalent but surprisingly easy-to-implement reformulation. Using the equivalence between reward models and the corresponding optimal policy, the algorithm features a simple objective that combines: (i) a preference optimization loss that directly aligns the policy with human preference, and (ii) a supervised learning loss that explicitly imitates the policy with a (suitable) baseline distribution. In the context of aligning large language models (LLM), this objective fuses the direct preference optimization (DPO) loss with the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) loss to help mitigate the overoptimization towards undesired responses, for which we name the algorithm Regularized Preference Optimization (RPO). Experiments of aligning LLMs demonstrate the improved performance of RPO compared with DPO baselines. Our work sheds light on the interplay between preference optimization and SFT in tuning LLMs with both theoretical guarantees and empirical evidence.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by The Thirty-Eighth Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems. 31 pages, 7 figures</p></details> |
| **[OpenRLHF: An Easy-to-use, Scalable and High-performance RLHF Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11143v4)** | 2024-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) continue to grow by scaling laws, reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has gained significant attention due to its outstanding performance. However, unlike pretraining or fine-tuning a single model, scaling reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) for training large language models poses coordination challenges across four models. We present OpenRLHF, an open-source framework enabling efficient RLHF scaling. Unlike existing RLHF frameworks that co-locate four models on the same GPUs, OpenRLHF re-designs scheduling for the models beyond 70B parameters using Ray, vLLM, and DeepSpeed, leveraging improved resource utilization and diverse training approaches. Integrating seamlessly with Hugging Face, OpenRLHF provides an out-of-the-box solution with optimized algorithms and launch scripts, which ensures user-friendliness. OpenRLHF implements RLHF, DPO, rejection sampling, and other alignment techniques. Empowering state-of-the-art LLM development, OpenRLHF's code is available at \url{https://github.com/OpenRLHF/OpenRLHF}.</p></details> |  |
| **[Continual SFT Matches Multimodal RLHF with Negative Supervision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14797v1)** | 2024-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal RLHF usually happens after supervised finetuning (SFT) stage to continually improve vision-language models' (VLMs) comprehension. Conventional wisdom holds its superiority over continual SFT during this preference alignment stage. In this paper, we observe that the inherent value of multimodal RLHF lies in its negative supervision, the logit of the rejected responses. We thus propose a novel negative supervised finetuning (nSFT) approach that fully excavates these information resided. Our nSFT disentangles this negative supervision in RLHF paradigm, and continually aligns VLMs with a simple SFT loss. This is more memory efficient than multimodal RLHF where 2 (e.g., DPO) or 4 (e.g., PPO) large VLMs are strictly required. The effectiveness of nSFT is rigorously proved by comparing it with various multimodal RLHF approaches, across different dataset sources, base VLMs and evaluation metrics. Besides, fruitful of ablations are provided to support our hypothesis. We hope this paper will stimulate further research to properly align large vision language models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Value Imprint: A Technique for Auditing the Human Values Embedded in RLHF Datasets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11937v1)** | 2024-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs are increasingly fine-tuned using RLHF datasets to align them with human preferences and values. However, very limited research has investigated which specific human values are operationalized through these datasets. In this paper, we introduce Value Imprint, a framework for auditing and classifying the human values embedded within RLHF datasets. To investigate the viability of this framework, we conducted three case study experiments by auditing the Anthropic/hh-rlhf, OpenAI WebGPT Comparisons, and Alpaca GPT-4-LLM datasets to examine the human values embedded within them. Our analysis involved a two-phase process. During the first phase, we developed a taxonomy of human values through an integrated review of prior works from philosophy, axiology, and ethics. Then, we applied this taxonomy to annotate 6,501 RLHF preferences. During the second phase, we employed the labels generated from the annotation as ground truth data for training a transformer-based machine learning model to audit and classify the three RLHF datasets. Through this approach, we discovered that information-utility values, including Wisdom/Knowledge and Information Seeking, were the most dominant human values within all three RLHF datasets. In contrast, prosocial and democratic values, including Well-being, Justice, and Human/Animal Rights, were the least represented human values. These findings have significant implications for developing language models that align with societal values and norms. We contribute our datasets to support further research in this area.</p></details> |  |
| **[RLHF Workflow: From Reward Modeling to Online RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07863v3)** | 2024-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present the workflow of Online Iterative Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) in this technical report, which is widely reported to outperform its offline counterpart by a large margin in the recent large language model (LLM) literature. However, existing open-source RLHF projects are still largely confined to the offline learning setting. In this technical report, we aim to fill in this gap and provide a detailed recipe that is easy to reproduce for online iterative RLHF. In particular, since online human feedback is usually infeasible for open-source communities with limited resources, we start by constructing preference models using a diverse set of open-source datasets and use the constructed proxy preference model to approximate human feedback. Then, we discuss the theoretical insights and algorithmic principles behind online iterative RLHF, followed by a detailed practical implementation. Our trained LLM achieves impressive performance on LLM chatbot benchmarks, including AlpacaEval-2, Arena-Hard, and MT-Bench, as well as other academic benchmarks such as HumanEval and TruthfulQA. We have shown that supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and iterative RLHF can obtain state-of-the-art performance with fully open-source datasets. Further, we have made our models, curated datasets, and comprehensive step-by-step code guidebooks publicly available.

| **[A Theoretical Framework for Partially Observed Reward-States in RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03282v3)** | 2024-11-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing deployment of reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) calls for a deeper theoretical investigation of its underlying models. The prevalent models of RLHF do not account for neuroscience-backed, partially-observed "internal states" that can affect human feedback, nor do they accommodate intermediate feedback during an interaction. Both of these can be instrumental in speeding up learning and improving alignment. To address these limitations, we model RLHF as reinforcement learning with partially observed reward-states (PORRL). We accommodate two kinds of feedback $-$ cardinal and dueling feedback. We first demonstrate that PORRL subsumes a wide class of RL problems, including traditional RL, RLHF, and reward machines. For cardinal feedback, we present two model-based methods (POR-UCRL, POR-UCBVI). We give both cardinal regret and sample complexity guarantees for the methods, showing that they improve over naive history-summarization. We then discuss the benefits of a model-free method like GOLF with naive history-summarization in settings with recursive internal states and dense intermediate feedback. For this purpose, we define a new history aware version of the Bellman-eluder dimension and give a new guarantee for GOLF in our setting, which can be exponentially sharper in illustrative examples. For dueling feedback, we show that a naive reduction to cardinal feedback fails to achieve sublinear dueling regret. We then present the first explicit reduction that converts guarantees for cardinal regret to dueling regret. In both feedback settings, we show that our models and guarantees generalize and extend existing ones.</p></details> | <details><summary>64 pa...</summary><p>64 pages. 14 pages for main paper, 50 pages for references + appendix</p></details> |
| **[Catastrophic Goodhart: regularizing RLHF with KL divergence does not mitigate heavy-tailed reward misspecification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14503v2)** | 2024-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When applying reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), the reward is learned from data and, therefore, always has some error. It is common to mitigate this by regularizing the policy with KL divergence from a base model, with the hope that balancing reward with regularization will achieve desirable outcomes despite this reward misspecification. We show that when the reward function has light-tailed error, optimal policies under less restrictive KL penalties achieve arbitrarily high utility. However, if error is heavy-tailed, some policies obtain arbitrarily high reward despite achieving no more utility than the base model--a phenomenon we call catastrophic Goodhart. We adapt a discrete optimization method to measure the tails of reward models, finding that they are consistent with light-tailed error. However, the pervasiveness of heavy-tailed distributions in many real-world applications indicates that future sources of RL reward could have heavy-tailed error, increasing the likelihood of reward hacking even with KL regularization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Mecha...</summary><p>Mechanistic Interpretability workshop at ICML 2024; Main conference poster at NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |
| **[SALSA: Soup-based Alignment Learning for Stronger Adaptation in RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01798v1)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In Large Language Model (LLM) development, Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is crucial for aligning models with human values and preferences. RLHF traditionally relies on the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the current policy and a frozen initial policy as a reference, which is added as a penalty in policy optimization algorithms like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). While this constraint prevents models from deviating too far from the initial checkpoint, it limits exploration of the reward landscape, reducing the model's ability to discover higher-quality solutions. As a result, policy optimization is often trapped in a narrow region of the parameter space, leading to suboptimal alignment and performance. This paper presents SALSA (Soup-based Alignment Learning for Stronger Adaptation), a novel approach designed to overcome these limitations by creating a more flexible and better located reference model through weight-space averaging of two independent supervised fine-tuned (SFT) models. This model soup allows for larger deviation in KL divergence and exploring a promising region of the solution space without sacrificing stability. By leveraging this more robust reference model, SALSA fosters better exploration, achieving higher rewards and improving model robustness, out-of-distribution generalization, and performance. We validate the effectiveness of SALSA through extensive experiments on popular open models (Llama2-7B, Mistral-7B, and Gemma-2B) across various benchmarks (MT-Bench, Arena-Hard, UltraFeedback), where it consistently surpasses PPO by fostering deeper exploration and achieving superior alignment in LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[InfoRM: Mitigating Reward Hacking in RLHF via Information-Theoretic Reward Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09345v5)** | 2024-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the success of reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) in aligning language models with human values, reward hacking, also termed reward overoptimization, remains a critical challenge. This issue primarily arises from reward misgeneralization, where reward models (RMs) compute reward using spurious features that are irrelevant to human preferences. In this work, we tackle this problem from an information-theoretic perspective and propose a framework for reward modeling, namely InfoRM, by introducing a variational information bottleneck objective to filter out irrelevant information. Notably, we further identify a correlation between overoptimization and outliers in the IB latent space of InfoRM, establishing it as a promising tool for detecting reward overoptimization. Inspired by this finding, we propose the Cluster Separation Index (CSI), which quantifies deviations in the IB latent space, as an indicator of reward overoptimization to facilitate the development of online mitigation strategies. Extensive experiments on a wide range of settings and RM scales (70M, 440M, 1.4B, and 7B) demonstrate the effectiveness of InfoRM. Further analyses reveal that InfoRM's overoptimization detection mechanism is not only effective but also robust across a broad range of datasets, signifying a notable advancement in the field of RLHF. The code will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper has been accepted by NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |
| **[Towards Reliable Alignment: Uncertainty-aware RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23726v1)** | 2024-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in aligning Large Language Models with human preferences have benefited from larger reward models and better preference data. However, most of these methodologies rely on the accuracy of the reward model. The reward models used in Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) are typically learned from small datasets using stochastic optimization algorithms, making them prone to high variability. We illustrate the inconsistencies between reward models empirically on numerous open-source datasets. We theoretically show that the fluctuation of the reward models can be detrimental to the alignment problem because the derived policies are more overfitted to the reward model and, hence, are riskier if the reward model itself is uncertain. We use concentration of measure to motivate an uncertainty-aware, conservative algorithm for policy optimization. We show that such policies are more risk-averse in the sense that they are more cautious of uncertain rewards. We theoretically prove that our proposed methodology has less risk than the vanilla method. We corroborate our theoretical results with experiments based on designing an ensemble of reward models. We use this ensemble of reward models to align a language model using our methodology and observe that our empirical findings match our theoretical predictions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reward Difference Optimization For Sample Reweighting In Offline RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09385v2)** | 2024-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), aligning LLMs with human preferences become increasingly important. Although Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) proves effective, it is complicated and highly resource-intensive. As such, offline RLHF has been introduced as an alternative solution, which directly optimizes LLMs with ranking losses on a fixed preference dataset. Current offline RLHF only captures the "ordinal relationship" between responses, overlooking the crucial aspect of how much one is preferred over the others. To address this issue, we propose a simple yet effective solution called Reward Difference Optimization, shorted as RDO. Specifically, we introduce reward difference coefficients to reweigh sample pairs in offline RLHF. We then develop a difference model which captures rich interactions between a pair of responses for predicting these difference coefficients. Experiments with 7B LLMs on the HH and TL;DR datasets substantiate the effectiveness of our method in both automatic metrics and human evaluation, thereby highlighting its potential for aligning LLMs with human intent and values</p></details> | EMNLP 2024 findings |
| **[Measuring memorization in RLHF for code completion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11715v2)** | 2024-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) has become the dominant method to align large models to user preferences. Unlike fine-tuning, for which there are many studies regarding training data memorization, it is not clear how memorization is affected by or introduced in the RLHF alignment process. Understanding this relationship is important as real user data may be collected and used to align large models; if user data is memorized during RLHF and later regurgitated, this could raise privacy concerns. In addition to RLHF, other methods such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and $\Psi$PO have gained popularity for learning directly from human preferences, removing the need for optimizing intermediary reward models with reinforcement learning. In this work, we analyze how training data memorization can surface and propagate through each phase of RLHF and direct preference learning. We focus our study on code completion models, as code completion is one of the most popular use cases for large language models. We find that RLHF significantly decreases the chance that data used for reward modeling and reinforcement learning is memorized in comparison to directly fine-tuning on this data, but that examples already memorized during the fine-tuning stage of RLHF, will, in the majority of cases, remain memorized after RLHF. In contrast, we find that aligning by learning directly from human preference data via a special case of $\Psi$PO, Identity Preference Optimization (IPO), increases the likelihood that training data is regurgitated compared to RLHF. Our work suggests that RLHF, as opposed to direct preference learning, is a safer way to mitigate the risk of regurgitating sensitive preference data when aligning large language models. We find our conclusions are robust across multiple code completion datasets, tasks, and model scales.</p></details> |  |

Among reasoning tasks, multi-step reasoning poses a particular challenge. Grounded in the theory of formal logic, we have developed an automated method, Multi-step Deduction (MuseD), for deductive reasoning data. MuseD has allowed us to create training and testing datasets for multi-step reasoning. Our generation method enables control over the complexity of the generated instructions, facilitating training and evaluation of models across different difficulty levels. Through RLHF training, our training data has demonstrated significant improvements in logical capabilities for both in-domain of out-of-domain reasoning tasks. Additionally, we have conducted tests to assess the multi-step reasoning abilities of various models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimal Design for Reward Modeling in RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17055v2)** | 2024-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has become a popular approach to align language models (LMs) with human preferences. This method involves collecting a large dataset of human pairwise preferences across various text generations and using it to infer (implicitly or explicitly) a reward model. Numerous methods have been proposed to learn the reward model and align a LM with it. However, the costly process of collecting human preferences has received little attention and could benefit from theoretical insights. This paper addresses this issue and aims to formalize the reward training model in RLHF. We frame the selection of an effective dataset as a simple regret minimization task, using a linear contextual dueling bandit method. Given the potentially large number of arms, this approach is more coherent than the best-arm identification setting. We then propose an offline framework for solving this problem. Under appropriate assumptions - linearity of the reward model in the embedding space, and boundedness of the reward parameter - we derive bounds on the simple regret. Finally, we provide a lower bound that matches our upper bound up to constant and logarithmic terms. To our knowledge, this is the first theoretical contribution in this area to provide an offline approach as well as worst-case guarantees.</p></details> |  |
| **[How to Evaluate Reward Models for RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14872v2)** | 2024-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a new benchmark for reward models that quantifies their ability to produce strong language models through RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback). The gold-standard approach is to run a full RLHF training pipeline and directly probe downstream LLM performance. However, this process is prohibitively expensive. To address this, we build a predictive model of downstream LLM performance by evaluating the reward model on proxy tasks. These proxy tasks consist of a large-scale human preference and a verifiable correctness preference dataset, in which we measure 12 metrics across 12 domains. To investigate which reward model metrics are most correlated to gold-standard RLHF outcomes, we launch an end-to-end RLHF experiment on a large-scale crowdsourced human preference platform to view real reward model downstream performance as ground truth. Ultimately, we compile our data and findings into Preference Proxy Evaluations (PPE), the first reward model benchmark explicitly linked to post-RLHF real-world human preference performance, which we open-source for public use and further development. Our code and evaluations can be found at https://github.com/lmarena/PPE .</p></details> |  |

| **[On The Global Convergence Of Online RLHF With Neural Parametrization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15610v1)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The importance of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values cannot be overstated. RLHF is a three-stage process that includes supervised fine-tuning (SFT), reward learning, and policy learning. Although there are several offline and online approaches to aligning LLMs, they often suffer from distribution shift issues. These issues arise from the inability to accurately capture the distributional interdependence between the reward learning and policy learning stages. Consequently, this has led to various approximated approaches, but the theoretical insights and motivations remain largely limited to tabular settings, which do not hold in practice. This gap between theoretical insights and practical implementations is critical. It is challenging to address this gap as it requires analyzing the performance of AI alignment algorithms in neural network-parameterized settings. Although bi-level formulations have shown promise in addressing distribution shift issues, they suffer from the hyper-gradient problem, and current approaches lack efficient algorithms to solve this. In this work, we tackle these challenges employing the bi-level formulation laid out in Kwon et al. (2024) along with the assumption \emph{Weak Gradient Domination} to demonstrate convergence in an RLHF setup, obtaining a sample complexity of $\epsilon^{-\frac{7}{2}}$ . Our key contributions are twofold: (i) We propose a bi-level formulation for AI alignment in parameterized settings and introduce a first-order approach to solve this problem. (ii) We analyze the theoretical convergence rates of the proposed algorithm and derive state-of-the-art bounds. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to establish convergence rate bounds and global optimality for the RLHF framework in neural network-parameterized settings.</p></details> |  |

This misalignment often results in noticeable distortions and artifacts that cause speech enhancement to be ineffective. To address these issues, we propose a reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) framework to fine-tune an existing speech enhancement approach by optimizing performance using a mean-opinion score (MOS)-based reward model. Our results show that the RLHF-finetuned model has the best performance across different benchmarks for both objective and MOS-based speech quality assessment metrics on the Voicebank+DEMAND dataset. Through ablation studies, we show that both policy gradient loss and supervised MSE loss are important for balanced optimization across the different metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICASSP 2025</p></details> |
| **[Reward-Robust RLHF in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15360v3)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to progress toward more advanced forms of intelligence, Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is increasingly seen as a key pathway toward achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). However, the reliance on reward-model-based (RM-based) alignment methods introduces significant challenges due to the inherent instability and imperfections of Reward Models (RMs), which can lead to critical issues such as reward hacking and misalignment with human intentions. In this paper, we introduce a reward-robust RLHF framework aimed at addressing these fundamental challenges, paving the way for more reliable and resilient learning in LLMs. Our approach introduces a novel optimization objective that carefully balances performance and robustness by incorporating Bayesian Reward Model Ensembles (BRME) to model the uncertainty set of reward functions. This allows the framework to integrate both nominal performance and minimum reward signals, ensuring more stable learning even with imperfect RMs. Empirical results demonstrate that our framework consistently outperforms baselines across diverse benchmarks, showing improved accuracy and long-term stability. We also provide a theoretical analysis, demonstrating that reward-robust RLHF approaches the stability of constant reward settings, which proves to be acceptable even in a stochastic-case analysis. Together, these contributions highlight the framework potential to enhance both the performance and stability of LLM alignment.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Accuracy Paradox in RLHF: When Better Reward Models Don't Yield Better Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06554v2)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback significantly enhances Natural Language Processing by aligning language models with human expectations. A critical factor in this alignment is the strength of reward models used during training. This study explores whether stronger reward models invariably lead to better language models. In this paper, through experiments on relevance, factuality, and completeness tasks using the QA-FEEDBACK dataset and reward models based on Longformer, we uncover a surprising paradox: language models trained with moderately accurate reward models outperform those guided by highly accurate ones. This challenges the widely held belief that stronger reward models always lead to better language models, and opens up new avenues for future research into the key factors driving model performance and how to choose the most suitable reward models.

| **[An Adaptive Placement and Parallelism Framework for Accelerating RLHF Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11819v3)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, ChatGPT or InstructGPT like large language models (LLM) has made a significant impact in the AI world. Many works have attempted to reproduce the complex InstructGPT's training pipeline, namely Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF). However, the mainstream distributed RLHF training methods typically adopt a fixed model placement strategy, referred to as the Co-located strategy. This strategy treats all four interdependent models involved in RLHF as a single entity, distributing them across all devices and applying parallelism techniques designed for a single model, regardless of the workload heterogeneity inherent to each model. As a result, this strategy exacerbates the generation bottlenecks in the RLHF training and degrades the overall training efficiency. To address these issues, we propose a flexible model placement framework that offers two general and agile model placement strategies. The Interleaving strategy helps reduce memory redundancy and communication costs of RLHF training by placing models without dependencies on exclusive devices with careful orchestration. On the other hand, the Disaggregated strategy improves the throughput of model training by separating the training and inference runtime of the RLHF pipeline with additional shadow models. Furthermore, our framework provides a simple user interface and guidelines to easily and flexibly configure these strategies in various training scenarios. Our experiments have shown that our strategy can achieve notable improvements up to 11x, compared to the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches. The results highlight the effectiveness and adaptability of our methods in accelerating the training of distributed RLHF.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mitigating the Alignment Tax of RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06256v4)** | 2024-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs acquire a wide range of abilities during pre-training, but aligning LLMs under Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) can lead to forgetting pretrained abilities, which is also known as the alignment tax. To investigate alignment tax, we conducted experiments with existing RLHF algorithms using OpenLLaMA-3B, which revealed a pronounced alignment tax in NLP tasks. Whereas, despite various techniques to mitigate forgetting, they are often at odds with the RLHF performance, leading to a trade-off between alignment performance and forgetting mitigation, leading to an alignment-forgetting trade-off. In this paper we show that model averaging, which simply interpolates between pre and post RLHF model weights, surprisingly achieves the most strongest alignment-forgetting Pareto front among a wide range of competing methods. To understand its effectiveness, we offer theoretical insights into model averaging, revealing that it enhances performance Pareto front by increasing feature diversity on the layers where tasks share overlapped feature spaces. Empirical evidence corroborates our analysis by showing the benefits of averaging low-level transformer layers. Building on the analysis and the observation that averaging different layers of the transformer leads to significantly different alignment-forgetting trade-offs, we propose Heterogeneous Model Averaging (HMA) to Heterogeneously find various combination ratios of model layers. HMA seeks to maximize the alignment performance while incurring minimal alignment tax. Moreover, we validate HMA's performance across a range of RLHF algorithms over OpenLLaMA-3B and further extend our findings to Mistral-7B which is evaluated by open-sourced preference model and GPT4.

| **[Regressing the Relative Future: Efficient Policy Optimization for Multi-turn RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04612v1)** | 2024-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success at tasks like summarization that involve a single turn of interaction. However, they can still struggle with multi-turn tasks like dialogue that require long-term planning. Previous works on multi-turn dialogue extend single-turn reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) methods to the multi-turn setting by treating all prior dialogue turns as a long context. Such approaches suffer from covariate shift: the conversations in the training set have previous turns generated by some reference policy, which means that low training error may not necessarily correspond to good performance when the learner is actually in the conversation loop. In response, we introduce REgressing the RELative FUture (REFUEL), an efficient policy optimization approach designed to address multi-turn RLHF in LLMs. REFUEL employs a single model to estimate $Q$-values and trains on self-generated data, addressing the covariate shift issue. REFUEL frames the multi-turn RLHF problem as a sequence of regression tasks on iteratively collected datasets, enabling ease of implementation. Theoretically, we prove that REFUEL can match the performance of any policy covered by the training set. Empirically, we evaluate our algorithm by using Llama-3.1-70B-it to simulate a user in conversation with our model. REFUEL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods such as DPO and REBEL across various settings. Furthermore, despite having only 8 billion parameters, Llama-3-8B-it fine-tuned with REFUEL outperforms Llama-3.1-70B-it on long multi-turn dialogues. Implementation of REFUEL can be found at https://github.com/ZhaolinGao/REFUEL/, and models trained by REFUEL can be found at https://huggingface.co/Cornell-AGI.</p></details> |  |
| **[WPO: Enhancing RLHF with Weighted Preference Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11827v2)** | 2024-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is a promising solution to align large language models (LLMs) more closely with human values. Off-policy preference optimization, where the preference data is obtained from other models, is widely adopted due to its cost efficiency and scalability. However, off-policy preference optimization often suffers from a distributional gap between the policy used for data collection and the target policy, leading to suboptimal optimization. In this paper, we propose a novel strategy to mitigate this problem by simulating on-policy learning with off-policy preference data. Our Weighted Preference Optimization (WPO) method adapts off-policy data to resemble on-policy data more closely by reweighting preference pairs according to their probability under the current policy. This method not only addresses the distributional gap problem but also enhances the optimization process without incurring additional costs. We validate our method on instruction following benchmarks including Alpaca Eval 2 and MT-bench. WPO not only outperforms Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) by up to 5.6% on Alpaca Eval 2 but also establishes a remarkable length-controlled winning rate against GPT-4-turbo of 76.7% based on Gemma-2-9b-it. We release the code and models at https://github.com/wzhouad/WPO.</p></details> | EMNLP 2024 |
| **[HybridFlow: A Flexible and Efficient RLHF Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19256v2)** | 2024-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is widely used in Large Language Model (LLM) alignment. Traditional RL can be modeled as a dataflow, where each node represents computation of a neural network (NN) and each edge denotes data dependencies between the NNs. RLHF complicates the dataflow by expanding each node into a distributed LLM training or generation program, and each edge into a many-to-many multicast. Traditional RL frameworks execute the dataflow using a single controller to instruct both intra-node computation and inter-node communication, which can be inefficient in RLHF due to large control dispatch overhead for distributed intra-node computation. Existing RLHF systems adopt a multi-controller paradigm, which can be inflexible due to nesting distributed computation and data communication. We propose HybridFlow, which combines single-controller and multi-controller paradigms in a hybrid manner to enable flexible representation and efficient execution of the RLHF dataflow. We carefully design a set of hierarchical APIs that decouple and encapsulate computation and data dependencies in the complex RLHF dataflow, allowing efficient operation orchestration to implement RLHF algorithms and flexible mapping of the computation onto various devices. We further design a 3D-HybridEngine for efficient actor model resharding between training and generation phases, with zero memory redundancy and significantly reduced communication overhead. Our experimental results demonstrate 1.53$\times$~20.57$\times$ throughput improvement when running various RLHF algorithms using HybridFlow, as compared with state-of-the-art baselines. HybridFlow source code will be available at https://github.com/volcengine/verl.</p></details> |  |

To solve this problem, alignment techniques such as RLHF, DPO and KTO are proposed. However, these alignment techniques have limitations. For example, RLHF requires training the reward model and policy separately, which is complex, time-consuming, memory intensive and unstable during training processes. DPO proposes a mapping between an optimal policy and a reward, greatly simplifying the training process of RLHF. However, it can not take full advantages of a reward model and it is limited to pairwise preference data. In this paper, we propose \textbf{UN}ified \textbf{A}lignment (UNA) which unifies RLHF/PPO, DPO and KTO. Firstly, we mathematically prove that given the classical RLHF objective, the optimal policy is induced by a generalize implicit reward function. With this novel mapping between a reward model and an optimal policy, UNA can 1. unify RLHF/PPO, DPO and KTO into a supervised learning of minimizing the difference between an implicit reward and an explicit reward; 2. outperform RLHF/PPO while simplify, stabilize, speed up and reduce memory burden of RL fine-tuning process; 3. accommodate different feedback types including pairwise, binary and scalar feedback. Downstream experiments show UNA outperforms DPO, KTO and RLHF.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Perfect Blend: Redefining RLHF with Mixture of Judges](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20370v1)** | 2024-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has become the leading approach for fine-tuning large language models (LLM). However, RLHF has limitations in multi-task learning (MTL) due to challenges of reward hacking and extreme multi-objective optimization (i.e., trade-off of multiple and/or sometimes conflicting objectives). Applying RLHF for MTL currently requires careful tuning of the weights for reward model and data combinations. This is often done via human intuition and does not generalize. In this work, we introduce a novel post-training paradigm which we called Constrained Generative Policy Optimization (CGPO). The core of CGPO is Mixture of Judges (MoJ) with cost-efficient constrained policy optimization with stratification, which can identify the perfect blend in RLHF in a principled manner. It shows strong empirical results with theoretical guarantees, does not require extensive hyper-parameter tuning, and is plug-and-play in common post-training pipelines. Together, this can detect and mitigate reward hacking behaviors while reaching a pareto-optimal point across an extremely large number of objectives. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that CGPO significantly outperforms standard RLHF algorithms like PPO and DPO across various tasks including general chat, STEM questions, instruction following, and coding. Specifically, CGPO shows improvements of 7.4% in AlpacaEval-2 (general chat), 12.5% in Arena-Hard (STEM & reasoning), and consistent gains in other domains like math and coding. Notably, PPO, while commonly used, is prone to severe reward hacking in popular coding benchmarks, which CGPO successfully addresses. This breakthrough in RLHF not only tackles reward hacking and extreme multi-objective optimization challenges but also advances the state-of-the-art in aligning general-purpose LLMs for diverse applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to conference</p></details> |
| **[RLHFuse: Efficient RLHF Training for Large Language Models with Inter- and Intra-Stage Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13221v2)** | 2024-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) enhances the alignment between LLMs and human preference. The workflow of RLHF typically involves several models and tasks in a series of distinct stages. Existing RLHF training systems view each task as the smallest execution unit thus overlooking the opportunities for subtask-level optimizations. Due to the intrinsic nature of RLHF training, i.e., the data skewness in the generation stage, and the pipeline bubbles in the training stage, existing RLHF systems suffer from low GPU utilization in production deployments. RLHFuse breaks the traditional view of RLHF workflow as a composition of individual tasks, splitting each task into finer-grained subtasks, and performing stage fusion to improve GPU utilization. RLHFuse contains two key ideas. First, for generation and inference tasks, RLHFuse splits them into sample-level subtasks, enabling efficient inter-stage fusion to mitigate the original generation bottleneck dominated by long-tailed samples. Second, for training tasks, RLHFuse breaks them into subtasks of micro-batches. By leveraging the intuition that pipeline execution can be essentially complemented by another pipeline, RLHFuse performs intra-stage fusion to concurrently execute these subtasks in the training stage with a fused pipeline schedule, resulting in fewer pipeline bubbles. In addition, RLHFuse incorporates a series of system optimizations tailored for each stage of RLHF, making it efficient and scalable for our internal product usage. We evaluate RLHFuse on various popular LLMs and the results show that RLHFuse increases the training throughput by up to 3.7x, compared to existing state-of-the-art systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantile Regression for Distributional Reward Models in RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10164v1)** | 2024-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has become a key method for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences through the use of reward models. However, traditional reward models typically generate point estimates, which oversimplify the diversity and complexity of human values and preferences. In this paper, we introduce Quantile Reward Models (QRMs), a novel approach to reward modeling that learns a distribution over rewards instead of a single scalar value. Our method uses quantile regression to estimate a full, potentially multimodal distribution over preferences, providing a more powerful and nuanced representation of preferences. This distributional approach can better capture the diversity of human values, addresses label noise, and accommodates conflicting preferences by modeling them as distinct modes in the distribution. Our experimental results show that QRM outperforms comparable traditional point-estimate models on RewardBench. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the additional information provided by the distributional estimates can be utilized in downstream applications, such as risk-aware reinforcement learning, resulting in LLM policies that generate fewer extremely negative responses. Our code and model are released at https://github.com/Nicolinho/QRM.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Data-Centric RLHF: Simple Metrics for Preference Dataset Comparison](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09603v1)** | 2024-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The goal of aligning language models to human preferences requires data that reveal these preferences. Ideally, time and money can be spent carefully collecting and tailoring bespoke preference data to each downstream application. However, in practice, a select few publicly available preference datasets are often used to train reward models for reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). While new preference datasets are being introduced with increasing frequency, there are currently no existing efforts to measure and compare these datasets. In this paper, we systematically study preference datasets through three perspectives: scale, label noise, and information content. We propose specific metrics for each of these perspectives and uncover different axes of comparison for a better understanding of preference datasets. Our work is a first step towards a data-centric approach to alignment by providing perspectives that aid in training efficiency and iterative data collection for RLHF.</p></details> | Working Paper |
| **[Reward Generalization in RLHF: A Topological Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10184v6)** | 2024-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing alignment methods share a common topology of information flow, where reward information is collected from humans, modeled with preference learning, and used to tune language models. However, this shared topology has not been systematically characterized, nor have its alternatives been thoroughly explored, leaving the problems of low data efficiency and unreliable generalization unaddressed. As a solution, we introduce a theoretical framework for investigating reward generalization in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), focusing on the topology of information flow at both macro and micro levels. At the macro level, we portray the RLHF information flow as an autoencoding process over behavior distributions, formalizing the RLHF objective of distributional consistency between human preference and model behavior. At the micro level, we present induced Bayesian networks as a theory of reward generalization in RLHF, introducing fine-grained dataset topologies into generalization bounds. Combining analysis on both levels, we propose reward modeling from tree-structured preference information. It is shown to reduce reward uncertainty by up to $\Theta(\log n/\log\log n)$ times compared to baselines, where $n$ is the dataset size. Validation on three NLP tasks shows that our tree-based reward model achieves an average win rate of 65% against baseline methods, thus improving reward generalization for free via topology design.</p></details> |  |

RL from AI Feedback (RLAIF), introduced in Bai et al., offers a promising alternative that trains the reward model (RM) on preferences generated by an off-the-shelf LLM. Across the tasks of summarization, helpful dialogue generation, and harmless dialogue generation, we show that RLAIF achieves comparable performance to RLHF. Furthermore, we take a step towards "self-improvement" by demonstrating that RLAIF can outperform a supervised fine-tuned baseline even when the AI labeler is the same size as the policy, or even the exact same checkpoint as the initial policy. Finally, we introduce direct-RLAIF (d-RLAIF) - a technique that circumvents RM training by obtaining rewards directly from an off-the-shelf LLM during RL, which achieves superior performance to canonical RLAIF. Our results suggest that RLAIF can achieve performance on-par with using human feedback, offering a potential solution to the scalability limitations of RLHF.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at ICML 2024</p></details> |
| **[Sequence to Sequence Reward Modeling: Improving RLHF by Language Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00162v1)** | 2024-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aligning the behavior of Large language models (LLMs) with human intentions and values remains a critical challenge. Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) aligns LLMs by training a reward model (RM) on human preferences and fine-tuning the LLMs to maximize RM feedback. Despite its effectiveness and popularity, RLHF is prone to biased local optimization. It means RM fails to provide feedback that accurately aligns with human preference, causing LLMs to explore unexpected generalizations, and failing to achieve alignment objectives. To mitigate this issue, we propose a novel \textit{sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) reward modeling} method. Its key insight is that learning from language feedback rather than scalar feedback improves RLHF without additional annotations. We replaced the reward modeling target from binary maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) with sequence MLE. This method enables richer and fine-grained language feedback without additional annotations, models, or training stages. Our experiments demonstrated its effectiveness, specifically, reducing the refusal-to-response paradigm in single-turn safety dialogues and the long-response bias in text summarization tasks. We provide further analysis that seq2seq RM improves RLHF performance across 2B and 7B LLMs on 3 NLP tasks, achieving an average win rate of 76.9\%. We further show that seq2seq RM can still improve the performance of RLHF under out-of-distribution prompts.</p></details> | 7 pages |

RLHF requires a large number of preference pairs as training data, which are often used in both the Supervised Fine-Tuning and Reward Model training and therefore publicly available datasets are commonly used. In this work, we study to what extent a malicious actor can manipulate the LMs generations by poisoning the preferences, i.e., injecting poisonous preference pairs into these datasets and the RLHF training process. We propose strategies to build poisonous preference pairs and test their performance by poisoning two widely used preference datasets. Our results show that preference poisoning is highly effective: injecting a small amount of poisonous data (1-5\% of the original dataset), we can effectively manipulate the LM to generate a target entity in a target sentiment (positive or negative). The findings from our experiments also shed light on strategies to defend against the preference poisoning attack.</p></details> |  |

However, there is limited theoretical justification for this phenomenon. Additionally, most recent studies focus on value-based algorithms despite the recent empirical successes of policy-based algorithms. In this work, we consider an RLHF algorithm based on policy optimization (PO-RLHF). The algorithm is based on the popular Policy Cover-Policy Gradient (PC-PG) algorithm, which assumes knowledge of the reward function. In PO-RLHF, knowledge of the reward function is not assumed, and the algorithm uses trajectory-based comparison feedback to infer the reward function. We provide performance bounds for PO-RLHF with low query complexity, which provides insight into why a small amount of human feedback may be sufficient to achieve good performance with RLHF. A key novelty is a trajectory-level elliptical potential analysis, which bounds the reward estimation error when comparison feedback (rather than numerical reward observation) is given. We provide and analyze algorithms PG-RLHF and NN-PG-RLHF for two settings: linear and neural function approximation, respectively.</p></details> |  |

Alongside these improvements, however, RLHF also often drives models to produce longer outputs. This paper demonstrates, on three diverse settings, that optimizing for response length is, much more than previously thought, a significant factor behind RLHF. Studying the strategies RL optimization uses to maximize reward, we find improvements in reward to largely be driven by increasing response length, instead of other features. Indeed, we find that even a purely length-based reward reproduces most downstream RLHF improvements over supervised fine-tuned models. Testing a comprehensive set of length-countering interventions, we identify the dominant source of these biases to be reward models, which, by studying training dynamics, we find are non-robust and easily influenced by length biases in preference data.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 13 figures, Accepted to COLM 2024</p></details> |

Notably, collecting human feedback for RLHF can be resource-intensive and lead to scalability issues for LLMs and complex tasks. Our proposed framework Proto-RM leverages prototypical networks to enhance reward models under limited human feedback. By enabling stable and reliable structural learning from fewer samples, Proto-RM significantly enhances LLMs' adaptability and accuracy in interpreting human preferences. Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate that Proto-RM significantly improves the performance of reward models and LLMs in human feedback tasks, achieving comparable and usually better results than traditional methods, while requiring significantly less data. in data-limited scenarios. This research offers a promising direction for enhancing the efficiency of reward models and optimizing the fine-tuning of language models under restricted feedback conditions.</p></details> | Accepted by ACL 2024 |
| **[ReaLHF: Optimized RLHF Training for Large Language Models through Parameter Reallocation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14088v1)** | 2024-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) stands as a pivotal technique in empowering large language model (LLM) applications. Since RLHF involves diverse computational workloads and intricate dependencies among multiple LLMs, directly adopting parallelization techniques from supervised training can result in sub-optimal performance. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel approach named parameter ReaLlocation, which dynamically redistributes LLM parameters in the cluster and adapts parallelization strategies during training. Building upon this idea, we introduce ReaLHF, a pioneering system capable of automatically discovering and running efficient execution plans for RLHF training given the desired algorithmic and hardware configurations. ReaLHF formulates the execution plan for RLHF as an augmented dataflow graph. Based on this formulation, ReaLHF employs a tailored search algorithm with a lightweight cost estimator to discover an efficient execution plan. Subsequently, the runtime engine deploys the selected plan by effectively parallelizing computations and redistributing parameters. We evaluate ReaLHF on the LLaMA-2 models with up to $4\times70$ billion parameters and 128 GPUs. The experiment results showcase ReaLHF's substantial speedups of $2.0-10.6\times$ compared to baselines. Furthermore, the execution plans generated by ReaLHF exhibit an average of $26\%$ performance improvement over heuristic approaches based on Megatron-LM. The source code of ReaLHF is publicly available at https://github.com/openpsi-project/ReaLHF .</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages (15 pages with references), 13 figures</p></details> |
| **[It Takes Two: On the Seamlessness between Reward and Policy Model in RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07971v2)** | 2024-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) involves training policy models (PMs) and reward models (RMs) to align language models with human preferences. Instead of focusing solely on PMs and RMs independently, we propose to examine their interactions during fine-tuning, introducing the concept of seamlessness. Our study starts with observing the saturation phenomenon, where continual improvements in RM and PM do not translate into RLHF progress. Our analysis shows that RMs fail to assign proper scores to PM responses, resulting in a 35% mismatch rate with human preferences, highlighting a significant discrepancy between PM and RM. To measure seamlessness between PM and RM without human effort, we propose an automatic metric, SEAM. SEAM quantifies the discrepancies between PM and RM judgments induced by data samples. We validate the effectiveness of SEAM in data selection and model augmentation. Our experiments demonstrate that (1) using SEAM-filtered data for RL training improves RLHF performance by 4.5%, and (2) SEAM-guided model augmentation results in a 4% performance improvement over standard augmentation methods.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents a novel two-step Coarse-to-Fine Actor model to address the inherent limitations in conversational and analytical capabilities of small-sized LLMs. Our approach begins with the Policy-based Coarse Actor, employing a technique we term "Continuous Maximization". The Coarse Actor establishes an enhanced, knowledge-rich pool adept at aligning with human preference styles in analysis and reasoning. Through the RLHF process, it employs Continuous Maximization, a strategy that dynamically and adaptively extends the output length limit, enabling the generation of more detailed and analytical content. Subsequently, the Fine Actor refines this analytical content, addressing the generation of excessively redundant information from the Coarse Actor. We introduce a "Knowledge Residue Merger" approach, refining the content from the Coarse Actor and merging it with an existing Instruction model to improve quality, correctness, and reduce redundancies. We applied our methodology to the popular Mistral model, creating Mistral-C2F, which has demonstrated exceptional performance across 11 general language tasks and the MT-Bench Dialogue task, outperforming similar-scale models and even larger models with 13B and 30B parameters. Our model has significantly improved conversational and analytical reasoning abilities.</p></details> |  |

Current autonomous driving methods typically utilize either human feedback in machine learning, including RL, or LLMs. Most feedback guides the car agent's learning process (e.g., controlling the car). RLHF is usually applied in the fine-tuning step, requiring direct human "preferences," which are not commonly used in optimizing autonomous driving models. In this research, we innovatively combine RLHF and LLMs to enhance autonomous driving safety. Training a model with human guidance from scratch is inefficient. Our framework starts with a pre-trained autonomous car agent model and implements multiple human-controlled agents, such as cars and pedestrians, to simulate real-life road environments. The autonomous car model is not directly controlled by humans. We integrate both physical and physiological feedback to fine-tune the model, optimizing this process using LLMs. This multi-agent interactive environment ensures safe, realistic interactions before real-world application. Finally, we will validate our model using data gathered from real-life testbeds located in New Jersey and New York City.</p></details> |  |
| **[Active Preference Optimization for Sample Efficient RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10500v2)** | 2024-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is pivotal in aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences. Although aligned generative models have shown remarkable abilities in various tasks, their reliance on high-quality human preference data creates a costly bottleneck in the practical application of RLHF. One primary reason is that current methods rely on uniformly picking prompt-generation pairs from a dataset of prompt-generations, to collect human feedback, resulting in sub-optimal alignment under a constrained budget, which highlights the criticality of adaptive strategies in efficient alignment. Recent works [Mehta et al., 2023, Muldrew et al., 2024] have tried to address this problem by designing various heuristics based on generation uncertainty. However, either the assumptions in [Mehta et al., 2023] are restrictive, or [Muldrew et al., 2024] do not provide any rigorous theoretical guarantee. To address these, we reformulate RLHF within contextual preference bandit framework, treating prompts as contexts, and develop an active-learning algorithm, $\textit{Active Preference Optimization}$ ($\texttt{APO}$), which enhances model alignment by querying preference data from the most important samples, achieving superior performance for small sample budget. We analyze the theoretical performance guarantees of $\texttt{APO}$ under the BTL preference model showing that the suboptimality gap of the policy learned via $\texttt{APO}$ scales as $O(1/\sqrt{T})$ for a budget of $T$. We also show that collecting preference data by choosing prompts randomly leads to a policy that suffers a constant sub-optimality. We perform detailed experimental evaluations on practical preference datasets to validate $\texttt{APO}$'s efficacy over the existing methods, establishing it as a sample-efficient and practical solution of alignment in a cost-effective and scalable manner.</p></details> | <details><summary>New e...</summary><p>New experimental results added.

However, their applications have been restricted to the supervised learning setting, where static objective functions with benign structures are considered. But bilevel problems such as incentive design, inverse reinforcement learning (RL), and RL from human feedback (RLHF) are often modeled as dynamic objective functions that go beyond the simple static objective structures, which pose significant challenges of using existing bilevel solutions. To tackle this new class of bilevel problems, we introduce the first principled algorithmic framework for solving bilevel RL problems through the lens of penalty formulation. We provide theoretical studies of the problem landscape and its penalty-based (policy) gradient algorithms. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms via simulations in the Stackelberg Markov game, RL from human feedback and incentive design.</p></details> | <details><summary>Short...</summary><p>Shorter version accepted to ICML 2024</p></details> |

We consider online exploration in RLHF, which exploits interactive access to human or AI feedback by deliberately encouraging the model to produce diverse, maximally informative responses. By allowing RLHF to confidently stray from the pre-trained model, online exploration offers the possibility of novel, potentially super-human capabilities, but its full potential as a paradigm for language model training has yet to be realized, owing to computational and statistical bottlenecks in directly adapting existing reinforcement learning techniques. We propose a new algorithm for online exploration in RLHF, Exploratory Preference Optimization (XPO), which is simple and practical -- a one-line change to (online) Direct Preference Optimization (DPO; Rafailov et al., 2023) -- yet enjoys the strongest known provable guarantees and promising empirical performance. XPO augments the DPO objective with a novel and principled exploration bonus, empowering the algorithm to explore outside the support of the initial model and human feedback data. In theory, we show that XPO is provably sample-efficient and converges to a near-optimal language model policy under natural exploration conditions, irrespective of whether the initial model has good coverage. Our analysis, which builds on the observation that DPO implicitly performs a form of $Q^{\star}$-approximation (or, Bellman error minimization), combines previously disparate techniques from language modeling and theoretical reinforcement learning in a serendipitous fashion through the perspective of KL-regularized Markov decision processes. Empirically, we find that XPO is more sample-efficient than non-exploratory DPO variants in a preliminary evaluation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Group Robust Preference Optimization in Reward-free RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20304v1)** | 2024-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adapting large language models (LLMs) for specific tasks usually involves fine-tuning through reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) on preference data. While these data often come from diverse labelers' groups (e.g., different demographics, ethnicities, company teams, etc.), traditional RLHF approaches adopt a "one-size-fits-all" approach, i.e., they indiscriminately assume and optimize a single preference model, thus not being robust to unique characteristics and needs of the various groups. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Group Robust Preference Optimization (GRPO) method to align LLMs to individual groups' preferences robustly. Our approach builds upon reward-free direct preference optimization methods, but unlike previous approaches, it seeks a robust policy which maximizes the worst-case group performance. To achieve this, GRPO adaptively and sequentially weights the importance of different groups, prioritizing groups with worse cumulative loss. We theoretically study the feasibility of GRPO and analyze its convergence for the log-linear policy class. By fine-tuning LLMs with GRPO using diverse group-based global opinion data, we significantly improved performance for the worst-performing groups, reduced loss imbalances across groups, and improved probability accuracies compared to non-robust baselines.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[RLHF from Heterogeneous Feedback via Personalization and Preference Aggregation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00254v2)** | 2024-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has been an effective technique for aligning AI systems with human values, with remarkable successes in fine-tuning large-language models recently. Most existing RLHF paradigms make the underlying assumption that human preferences are relatively homogeneous, and can be encoded by a single reward model. In this paper, we focus on addressing the issues due to the inherent heterogeneity in human preferences, as well as their potential strategic behavior in providing feedback. Specifically, we propose two frameworks to address heterogeneous human feedback in principled ways: personalization-based one and aggregation-based one. For the former, we propose two approaches based on representation learning and clustering, respectively, for learning multiple reward models that trades off the bias (due to preference heterogeneity) and variance (due to the use of fewer data for learning each model by personalization). We then establish sample complexity guarantees for both approaches. For the latter, we aim to adhere to the single-model framework, as already deployed in the current RLHF paradigm, by carefully aggregating diverse and truthful preferences from humans. We propose two approaches based on reward and preference aggregation, respectively: the former utilizes both utilitarianism and Leximin approaches to aggregate individual reward models, with sample complexity guarantees; the latter directly aggregates the human feedback in the form of probabilistic opinions. Under the probabilistic-opinion-feedback model, we also develop an approach to handle strategic human labelers who may bias and manipulate the aggregated preferences with untruthful feedback. Based on the ideas in mechanism design, our approach ensures truthful preference reporting, with the induced aggregation rule maximizing social welfare functions.</p></details> | Added experiments |
| **[On the Algorithmic Bias of Aligning Large Language Models with RLHF: Preference Collapse and Matching Regularization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16455v1)** | 2024-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences is crucial for informing fair, economically sound, and statistically efficient decision-making processes. However, we argue that reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) -- the predominant approach for aligning LLMs with human preferences through a reward model -- suffers from an inherent algorithmic bias due to its Kullback--Leibler-based regularization in optimization. In extreme cases, this bias could lead to a phenomenon we term preference collapse, where minority preferences are virtually disregarded. To mitigate this algorithmic bias, we introduce preference matching (PM) RLHF, a novel approach that provably aligns LLMs with the preference distribution of the reward model under the Bradley--Terry--Luce/Plackett--Luce model. Central to our approach is a PM regularizer that takes the form of the negative logarithm of the LLM's policy probability distribution over responses, which helps the LLM balance response diversification and reward maximization. Notably, we obtain this regularizer by solving an ordinary differential equation that is necessary for the PM property. For practical implementation, we introduce a conditional variant of PM RLHF that is tailored to natural language generation. Finally, we empirically validate the effectiveness of conditional PM RLHF through experiments on the OPT-1.3B and Llama-2-7B models, demonstrating a 29% to 41% improvement in alignment with human preferences, as measured by a certain metric, compared to standard RLHF.</p></details> |  |

We first identify the primary challenges of existing popular methods like offline PPO and offline DPO as lacking in strategical exploration of the environment. Then, to understand the mathematical principle of RLHF, we consider a standard mathematical formulation, the reverse-KL regularized contextual bandit for RLHF. Despite its widespread practical application, a rigorous theoretical analysis of this formulation remains open. We investigate its behavior in three distinct settings -- offline, online, and hybrid -- and propose efficient algorithms with finite-sample theoretical guarantees. Moving towards practical applications, our framework, with a robust approximation of the information-theoretical policy improvement oracle, naturally gives rise to several novel RLHF algorithms. This includes an iterative version of the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) algorithm for online settings, and a multi-step rejection sampling strategy for offline scenarios. Our empirical evaluations on real-world alignment experiment of large language model demonstrate that these proposed methods significantly surpass existing strong baselines, such as DPO and Rejection Sampling Optimization (RSO), showcasing the connections between solid theoretical foundations and their potent practical implementations.</p></details> | <details><summary>53 pa...</summary><p>53 pages; theoretical study and algorithmic design of iterative RLHF and DPO</p></details> |

The key to the strategy is learning a reward model ($\varphi$), which can reflect the latent reward model of humans. While this strategy has proven effective, the training methodology requires a lot of human preference annotation (usually in the order of tens of thousands) to train $\varphi$. Such a large-scale annotation is justifiable when it's a one-time effort, and the reward model is universally applicable. However, human goals are subjective and depend on the task, requiring task-specific preference annotations, which can be impractical to fulfill. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach to infuse domain knowledge into $\varphi$, which reduces the amount of preference annotation required ($21\times$), omits Alignment Tax, and provides some interpretability. We validate our approach in E-Commerce Opinion Summarization, with a significant reduction in dataset size (to just $940$ samples) while advancing the SOTA ($\sim4$ point ROUGE-L improvement, $68\%$ of times preferred by humans over SOTA). Our contributions include a novel Reward Modeling technique and two new datasets: PromptOpinSumm (supervised data for Opinion Summarization) and OpinPref (a gold-standard human preference dataset). The proposed methodology opens up avenues for efficient RLHF, making it more adaptable to applications with varying human values. We release the artifacts (Code: github.com/efficient-rlhf.

Hidden context refers to data that affects the feedback received, but which is not represented in the data used to train a preference model. This captures common issues of data collection, such as having human annotators with varied preferences, cognitive processes that result in seemingly irrational behavior, and combining data labeled according to different criteria. We prove that standard applications of preference learning, including reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), implicitly aggregate over hidden contexts according to a well-known voting rule called Borda count. We show this can produce counter-intuitive results that are very different from other methods which implicitly aggregate via expected utility. Furthermore, our analysis formalizes the way that preference learning from users with diverse values tacitly implements a social choice function. A key implication of this result is that annotators have an incentive to misreport their preferences in order to influence the learned model, leading to vulnerabilities in the deployment of RLHF. As a step towards mitigating these problems, we introduce a class of methods called distributional preference learning (DPL). DPL methods estimate a distribution of possible score values for each alternative in order to better account for hidden context. Experimental results indicate that applying DPL to RLHF for LLM chatbots identifies hidden context in the data and significantly reduces subsequent jailbreak vulnerability.

This framework often consists of two steps: learning a reward model from an offline preference dataset followed by running online RL to optimize the learned reward model. In this work, leveraging the idea of reset, we propose a new RLHF algorithm with provable guarantees. Motivated by the fact that offline preference dataset provides informative states (i.e., data that is preferred by the labelers), our new algorithm, Dataset Reset Policy Optimization (DR-PO), integrates the existing offline preference dataset into the online policy training procedure via dataset reset: it directly resets the policy optimizer to the states in the offline dataset, instead of always starting from the initial state distribution. In theory, we show that DR-PO learns to perform at least as good as any policy that is covered by the offline dataset under general function approximation with finite sample complexity. In experiments, we demonstrate that on both the TL;DR summarization and the Anthropic Helpful Harmful (HH) dataset, the generation from DR-PO is better than that from Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Direction Preference Optimization (DPO), under the metric of GPT4 win-rate.

However, training LLMs to serve as effective assistants for humans requires careful consideration. A promising approach is reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), which leverages human feedback to update the model in accordance with human preferences and mitigate issues like toxicity and hallucinations. Yet, an understanding of RLHF for LLMs is largely entangled with initial design choices that popularized the method and current research focuses on augmenting those choices rather than fundamentally improving the framework. In this paper, we analyze RLHF through the lens of reinforcement learning principles to develop an understanding of its fundamentals, dedicating substantial focus to the core component of RLHF -- the reward model. Our study investigates modeling choices, caveats of function approximation, and their implications on RLHF training algorithms, highlighting the underlying assumptions made about the expressivity of reward. Our analysis improves the understanding of the role of reward models and methods for their training, concurrently revealing limitations of the current methodology. We characterize these limitations, including incorrect generalization, model misspecification, and the sparsity of feedback, along with their impact on the performance of a language model. The discussion and analysis are substantiated by a categorical review of current literature, serving as a reference for researchers and practitioners to understand the challenges of RLHF and build upon existing efforts.</p></details> |  |

To reduce harmful outputs, produces and vendors of LLMs have used reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF). In tandem, LLM vendors have been increasingly enabling fine-tuning of their most powerful models. However, concurrent work has shown that fine-tuning can remove RLHF protections. We may expect that the most powerful models currently available (GPT-4) are less susceptible to fine-tuning attacks. In this work, we show the contrary: fine-tuning allows attackers to remove RLHF protections with as few as 340 examples and a 95% success rate. These training examples can be automatically generated with weaker models. We further show that removing RLHF protections does not decrease usefulness on non-censored outputs, providing evidence that our fine-tuning strategy does not decrease usefulness despite using weaker models to generate training data. Our results show the need for further research on protections on LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NAACL 2024. (7 pages)</p></details> |

| **[Balancing Enhancement, Harmlessness, and General Capabilities: Enhancing Conversational LLMs with Direct RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02513v1)** | 2024-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent advancements in Conversational Large Language Models (LLMs), a concerning trend has emerged, showing that many new base LLMs experience a knowledge reduction in their foundational capabilities following Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). This process often leads to issues such as forgetting or a decrease in the base model's abilities. Moreover, fine-tuned models struggle to align with user preferences, inadvertently increasing the generation of toxic outputs when specifically prompted. To overcome these challenges, we adopted an innovative approach by completely bypassing SFT and directly implementing Harmless Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). Our method not only preserves the base model's general capabilities but also significantly enhances its conversational abilities, while notably reducing the generation of toxic outputs. Our approach holds significant implications for fields that demand a nuanced understanding and generation of responses, such as customer service. We applied this methodology to Mistral, the most popular base model, thereby creating Mistral-Plus. Our validation across 11 general tasks demonstrates that Mistral-Plus outperforms similarly sized open-source base models and their corresponding instruct versions. Importantly, the conversational abilities of Mistral-Plus were significantly improved, indicating a substantial advancement over traditional SFT models in both safety and user preference alignment.</p></details> |  |

While there has been significant work developing these methods, our understanding of the benefits and downsides of each stage in RLHF is still limited. To fill this gap, we present an extensive analysis of how each stage of the process (i.e. supervised fine-tuning (SFT), reward modelling, and RLHF) affects two key properties: out-of-distribution (OOD) generalisation and output diversity. OOD generalisation is crucial given the wide range of real-world scenarios in which these models are being used, while output diversity refers to the model's ability to generate varied outputs and is important for a variety of use cases. We perform our analysis across two base models on both summarisation and instruction following tasks, the latter being highly relevant for current LLM use cases. We find that RLHF generalises better than SFT to new inputs, particularly as the distribution shift between train and test becomes larger. However, RLHF significantly reduces output diversity compared to SFT across a variety of measures, implying a tradeoff in current LLM fine-tuning methods between generalisation and diversity. Our results provide guidance on which fine-tuning method should be used depending on the application, and show that more research is needed to improve the tradeoff between generalisation and diversity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available here: https://github.com/facebookresearch/rlfh-gen-div</p></details> |

The same issue also holds for some reward models in RL. To address the challenges in both training and evaluation, we establish a more reliable evaluation protocol for comparing different training configurations, which inspects the trade-off between LLM evaluation score and response length obtained by varying training hyperparameters. Based on this evaluation, we conduct large-scale studies, where the results shed insights into the efficacy of hyperparameters and tricks used in RL on mitigating length bias. We further propose to improve the reward model by jointly training two linear heads on shared feature representations to predict the rewards, one trained to correlate with length, and the other trained to decorrelate with length and therefore focus more on the actual content. We then discard the length head in RL to prevent reward hacking on length. Experiments demonstrate that our approach almost eliminates the reward correlation with length, and improves the obtained policy by a significant margin.</p></details> |  |

The initial phase of RLHF involves learning human values using a reward model from ranking data. It is observed that the performance of the reward model degrades after one epoch of training, and optimizing too much against the learned reward model eventually hinders the true objective. This paper delves into these issues, leveraging the theoretical insights to design improved reward learning algorithm termed 'Iterative Data Smoothing' (IDS). The core idea is that during each training epoch, we not only update the model with the data, but also update the date using the model, replacing hard labels with soft labels. Our empirical findings highlight the superior performance of this approach over the traditional methods.</p></details> |  |

While reward models are often considered central to achieving high performance, they face the following challenges in practical applications: (1) Incorrect and ambiguous preference pairs in the dataset may hinder the reward model from accurately capturing human intent. (2) Reward models trained on data from a specific distribution often struggle to generalize to examples outside that distribution and are not suitable for iterative RLHF training. In this report, we attempt to address these two issues. (1) From a data perspective, we propose a method to measure the strength of preferences within the data, based on a voting mechanism of multiple reward models. Experimental results confirm that data with varying preference strengths have different impacts on reward model performance. We introduce a series of novel methods to mitigate the influence of incorrect and ambiguous preferences in the dataset and fully leverage high-quality preference data. (2) From an algorithmic standpoint, we introduce contrastive learning to enhance the ability of reward models to distinguish between chosen and rejected responses, thereby improving model generalization. Furthermore, we employ meta-learning to enable the reward model to maintain the ability to differentiate subtle differences in out-of-distribution samples, and this approach can be utilized for iterative RLHF optimization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Is RLHF More Difficult than Standard RL?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14111v2)** | 2023-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) learns from preference signals, while standard Reinforcement Learning (RL) directly learns from reward signals. Preferences arguably contain less information than rewards, which makes preference-based RL seemingly more difficult. This paper theoretically proves that, for a wide range of preference models, we can solve preference-based RL directly using existing algorithms and techniques for reward-based RL, with small or no extra costs. Specifically, (1) for preferences that are drawn from reward-based probabilistic models, we reduce the problem to robust reward-based RL that can tolerate small errors in rewards; (2) for general arbitrary preferences where the objective is to find the von Neumann winner, we reduce the problem to multiagent reward-based RL which finds Nash equilibria for factored Markov games with a restricted set of policies. The latter case can be further reduced to adversarial MDP when preferences only depend on the final state. We instantiate all reward-based RL subroutines by concrete provable algorithms, and apply our theory to a large class of models including tabular MDPs and MDPs with generic function approximation. We further provide guarantees when K-wise comparisons are available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation at NeurIPS 2023; 29 pages</p></details> |
| **[Safe RLHF: Safe Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12773v1)** | 2023-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the development of large language models (LLMs), striking a balance between the performance and safety of AI systems has never been more critical. However, the inherent tension between the objectives of helpfulness and harmlessness presents a significant challenge during LLM training. To address this issue, we propose Safe Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (Safe RLHF), a novel algorithm for human value alignment. Safe RLHF explicitly decouples human preferences regarding helpfulness and harmlessness, effectively avoiding the crowdworkers' confusion about the tension and allowing us to train separate reward and cost models. We formalize the safety concern of LLMs as an optimization task of maximizing the reward function while satisfying specified cost constraints. Leveraging the Lagrangian method to solve this constrained problem, Safe RLHF dynamically adjusts the balance between the two objectives during fine-tuning. Through a three-round fine-tuning using Safe RLHF, we demonstrate a superior ability to mitigate harmful responses while enhancing model performance compared to existing value-aligned algorithms. Experimentally, we fine-tuned the Alpaca-7B using Safe RLHF and aligned it with collected human preferences, significantly improving its helpfulness and harmlessness according to human evaluations.</p></details> |  |

| **[A Framework for Robust Cognitive Evaluation of LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02789v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Emergent cognitive abilities in large language models (LLMs) have been widely observed, but their nature and underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. A growing body of research draws on cognitive science to investigate LLM cognition, but standard methodologies and experimen-tal pipelines have not yet been established. To address this gap we develop CognitivEval, a framework for systematically evaluating the artificial cognitive capabilities of LLMs, with a particular emphasis on robustness in response collection. The key features of CognitivEval include: (i) automatic prompt permutations, and (ii) testing that gathers both generations and model probability estimates. Our experiments demonstrate that these features lead to more robust experimental outcomes. Using CognitivEval, we replicate five classic experiments in cognitive science, illustrating the framework's generalizability across various experimental tasks and obtaining a cognitive profile of several state of the art LLMs. CognitivEval will be released publicly to foster broader collaboration within the cognitive science community.</p></details> |  |
| **[GRACE: Generating Socially Appropriate Robot Actions Leveraging LLMs and Human Explanations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16879v2)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When operating in human environments, robots need to handle complex tasks while both adhering to social norms and accommodating individual preferences. For instance, based on common sense knowledge, a household robot can predict that it should avoid vacuuming during a social gathering, but it may still be uncertain whether it should vacuum before or after having guests. In such cases, integrating common-sense knowledge with human preferences, often conveyed through human explanations, is fundamental yet a challenge for existing systems. In this paper, we introduce GRACE, a novel approach addressing this while generating socially appropriate robot actions. GRACE leverages common sense knowledge from LLMs, and it integrates this knowledge with human explanations through a generative network. The bidirectional structure of GRACE enables robots to refine and enhance LLM predictions by utilizing human explanations and makes robots capable of generating such explanations for human-specified actions. Our evaluations show that integrating human explanations boosts GRACE's performance, where it outperforms several baselines and provides sensible explanations.</p></details> | <details><summary>2025 ...</summary><p>2025 IEEE International Conference on Robotics & Automation (ICRA), Supplementary video: https://youtu.be/GTNCC1GkiQ4</p></details> |

For example, when a user asks a robot to prepare avocado toast, the task involves several sequential steps. Moreover, such instructions can be ambiguous or infeasible for the robot or may exceed the robot's existing knowledge. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer strong language reasoning capabilities to handle these challenges, effectively integrating them into robotic systems remains a key challenge. To address this, we propose BT-ACTION, a test-driven approach that combines the modular structure of Behavior Trees (BT) with LLMs to generate coherent sequences of robot actions for following complex user instructions, specifically in the context of preparing recipes in a kitchen-assistance setting. We evaluated BT-ACTION in a comprehensive user study with 45 participants, comparing its performance to direct LLM prompting. Results demonstrate that the modular design of BT-ACTION helped the robot make fewer mistakes and increased user trust, and participants showed a significant preference for the robot leveraging BT-ACTION. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/1Eggbert7/BT_LLM.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing LLM Robustness to Perturbed Instructions: An Empirical Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02733v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are highly vulnerable to input perturbations, as even a small prompt change may result in a substantially different output. Existing methods to enhance LLM robustness are primarily focused on perturbed data samples, whereas improving resiliency to perturbations of task-level instructions has remained relatively underexplored. In this work, we focus on character- and word-level edits of task-specific instructions, which substantially degrade downstream performance. We experiment with a variety of techniques to enhance the robustness of LLMs, including self-denoising and representation alignment, testing different models (Llama 3 and Flan-T5), datasets (CoLA, QNLI, SST-2) and instructions (both task-oriented and role-oriented). We find that, on average, self-denoising -- whether performed by a frozen LLM or a fine-tuned model -- achieves substantially higher performance gains than alternative strategies, including more complex baselines such as ensembling and supervised methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Build...</summary><p>Building Trust Workshop, ICLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Why do LLMs attend to the first token?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02732v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) tend to attend heavily to the first token in the sequence -- creating a so-called attention sink. Many works have studied this phenomenon in detail, proposing various ways to either leverage or alleviate it. Attention sinks have been connected to quantisation difficulties, security issues, and streaming attention. Yet, while many works have provided conditions in which they occur or not, a critical question remains shallowly answered: Why do LLMs learn such patterns and how are they being used? In this work, we argue theoretically and empirically that this mechanism provides a method for LLMs to avoid over-mixing, connecting this to existing lines of work that study mathematically how information propagates in Transformers. We conduct experiments to validate our theoretical intuitions and show how choices such as context length, depth, and data packing influence the sink behaviour. We hope that this study provides a new practical perspective on why attention sinks are useful in LLMs, leading to a better understanding of the attention patterns that form during training.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Hidden Space of Safety: Understanding Preference-Tuned LLMs in Multilingual context](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02708v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Alignment tuning has enabled large language models to excel in reasoning, instruction-following, and minimizing harmful generations. However, despite their widespread deployment, these models exhibit a monolingual bias, raising concerns about the effectiveness of alignment across languages. Current alignment methods predominantly focus on English, leaving it unclear how alignment mechanism generalize to multilingual settings. To address this, we conduct a systematic analysis of distributional shifts in the embedding space of LLMs before and after alignment, uncovering its impact on model behavior across diverse languages. We leverage the alignment-induced separation in safety space as a quantitative tool to measure how alignment enforces safety constraints. Our study evaluates seven LLMs using balanced toxicity datasets and parallel text-detoxification benchmarks, revealing substantial disparities in the latent representation space between high-resource and low-resource languages. These findings underscore the need for language-specific fine-tuning to ensure fair, reliable and robust multilingual alignment. Our insights provide a foundation for developing truly safe multilingual LLMs, emphasizing the urgency of addressing alignment gaps in underrepresented languages.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 11 Figures, 2 Tables, currently under review at ACL 2025</p></details> |

Unlike other reasoning questions, FPs often involve real-world impracticalities or ambiguous concepts, making them challenging even for humans to solve. Despite advancements in AI, particularly with large language models (LLMs) in various reasoning tasks, FPs remain relatively under-explored. This work conducted an exploratory study to examine the capabilities and limitations of LLMs in solving FPs. We first evaluated the overall performance of three advanced LLMs using a publicly available FP dataset. We designed prompts according to the recently proposed TELeR taxonomy, including a zero-shot scenario. Results indicated that all three LLMs achieved a fp_score (range between 0 - 1) below 0.5, underscoring the inherent difficulty of these reasoning tasks. To further investigate, we categorized FPs into standard and specific questions, hypothesizing that LLMs would perform better on standard questions, which are characterized by clarity and conciseness, than on specific ones. Comparative experiments confirmed this hypothesis, demonstrating that LLMs performed better on standard FPs in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages,7 tables, 5 figures</p></details> |
| **[Multi-Mission Tool Bench: Assessing the Robustness of LLM based Agents through Related and Dynamic Missions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02623v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong potential as agents for tool invocation due to their advanced comprehension and planning capabilities. Users increasingly rely on LLM-based agents to solve complex missions through iterative interactions. However, existing benchmarks predominantly access agents in single-mission scenarios, failing to capture real-world complexity. To bridge this gap, we propose the Multi-Mission Tool Bench. In the benchmark, each test case comprises multiple interrelated missions. This design requires agents to dynamically adapt to evolving demands. Moreover, the proposed benchmark explores all possible mission-switching patterns within a fixed mission number. Specifically, we propose a multi-agent data generation framework to construct the benchmark. We also propose a novel method to evaluate the accuracy and efficiency of agent decisions with dynamic decision trees. Experiments on diverse open-source and closed-source LLMs reveal critical factors influencing agent robustness and provide actionable insights to the tool invocation society.</p></details> |  |

Similar paradigm shifts have occurred in the past with the introduction of search engines and Wikipedia, which replaced or supplemented traditional information sources such as libraries and books. This study investigates the potential for LLMs to represent the next shift in learning, focusing on their role in information discovery and synthesis compared to existing technologies, such as search engines. Using a within-subjects, counterbalanced design, participants learned new topics using a search engine (Google) and an LLM (ChatGPT). Post-task follow-up interviews explored students' reflections, preferences, pain points, and overall perceptions. We present analysis of their responses that show nuanced insights into when, why, and how students prefer LLMs over search engines, offering implications for educators, policymakers, and technology developers navigating the evolving educational landscape.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient LLM Inference using Dynamic Input Pruning and Cache-Aware Masking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01380v2)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While mobile devices provide ever more compute power, improvements in DRAM bandwidth are much slower. This is unfortunate for large language model (LLM) token generation, which is heavily memory-bound. Previous work has proposed to leverage natural dynamic activation sparsity in ReLU-activated LLMs to reduce effective DRAM bandwidth per token. However, more recent LLMs use SwiGLU instead of ReLU, which results in little inherent sparsity. While SwiGLU activations can be pruned based on magnitude, the resulting sparsity patterns are difficult to predict, rendering previous approaches ineffective. To circumvent this issue, our work introduces Dynamic Input Pruning (DIP): a predictor-free dynamic sparsification approach, which preserves accuracy with minimal fine-tuning. DIP can further use lightweight LoRA adapters to regain some performance lost during sparsification. Lastly, we describe a novel cache-aware masking strategy, which considers the cache state and activation magnitude to further increase cache hit rate, improving LLM token rate on mobile devices. DIP outperforms other methods in terms of accuracy, memory and throughput trade-offs across simulated hardware settings. On Phi-3-Medium, DIP achieves a 46\% reduction in memory and 40\% increase in throughput with $<$ 0.1 loss in perplexity when compared to streaming the dense model from Flash.

Wikipedia reflects this imbalance, with content in low-resource languages frequently outdated or incomplete. Recent research has sought to improve cross-language synchronization of Wikipedia tables using rule-based methods. These approaches can be effective, but they struggle with complexity and generalization. This paper explores large language models (LLMs) for multilingual information synchronization, using zero-shot prompting as a scalable solution. We introduce the Information Updation dataset, simulating the real-world process of updating outdated Wikipedia tables, and evaluate LLM performance. Our findings reveal that single-prompt approaches often produce suboptimal results, prompting us to introduce a task decomposition strategy that enhances coherence and accuracy. Our proposed method outperforms existing baselines, particularly in Information Updation (1.79%) and Information Addition (20.58%), highlighting the model strength in dynamically updating and enriching data across architectures</p></details> | <details><summary>17 Pa...</summary><p>17 Pages, 11 Tables, 2 Figures</p></details> |
| **[Exploring Individual Factors in the Adoption of LLMs for Specific Software Engineering Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02553v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) is transforming software development, significantly enhancing software engineering processes. Research has explored their role within development teams, focusing on specific tasks such as artifact generation, decision-making support, and information retrieval. Despite the growing body of work on LLMs in software engineering, most studies have centered on broad adoption trends, neglecting the nuanced relationship between individual cognitive and behavioral factors and their impact on task-specific adoption. While factors such as perceived effort and performance expectancy have been explored at a general level, their influence on distinct software engineering tasks remains underexamined. This gap hinders the development of tailored LLM-based systems (e.g., Generative AI Agents) that align with engineers' specific needs and limits the ability of team leaders to devise effective strategies for fostering LLM adoption in targeted workflows. This study bridges this gap by surveying N=188 software engineers to test the relationship between individual attributes related to technology adoption and LLM adoption across five key tasks, using structural equation modeling (SEM). The Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2) was applied to characterize individual adoption behaviors. The findings reveal that task-specific adoption is influenced by distinct factors, some of which negatively impact adoption when considered in isolation, underscoring the complexity of LLM integration in software engineering. To support effective adoption, this article provides actionable recommendations, such as seamlessly integrating LLMs into existing development environments and encouraging peer-driven knowledge sharing to enhance information retrieval.</p></details> |  |

Efficient merging of printing workpieces can significantly enhance the processing efficiency of the production line. Addressing the challenge, a Large Language Model (LLM)-driven method is established in this paper for the autonomous merging of 3D printing work orders, integrated with a memory-augmented learning strategy. In industrial scenarios, both device and order features are modeled into LLM-readable natural language prompt templates, and develop an order-device matching tool along with a merging interference checking module. By incorporating a self-memory learning strategy, an intelligent agent for autonomous order merging is constructed, resulting in improved accuracy and precision in order allocation. The proposed method effectively leverages the strengths of LLMs in industrial applications while reducing hallucination.</p></details> | 6 pages, 5 figures |
| **[ZClip: Adaptive Spike Mitigation for LLM Pre-Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02507v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training large language models (LLMs) presents numerous challenges, including gradient instability and loss spikes. These phenomena can lead to catastrophic divergence, requiring costly checkpoint restoration and data batch skipping. Traditional gradient clipping techniques, such as constant or norm-based methods, fail to address these issues effectively due to their reliance on fixed thresholds or heuristics, leading to inefficient learning and requiring frequent manual intervention. In this work, we propose ZClip, an adaptive gradient clipping algorithm that dynamically adjusts the clipping threshold based on statistical properties of gradient norms over time. Unlike prior reactive strategies, ZClip proactively adapts to training dynamics without making any prior assumptions on the scale and the temporal evolution of gradient norms. At its core, it leverages z-score-based anomaly detection to identify and mitigate large gradient spikes, preventing malignant loss spikes while not interfering with convergence otherwise. Our code is available at: https://github.com/bluorion-com/ZClip.</p></details> |  |

While LLMs are regularly used all over the world by experts and lay-people alike, they are predominantly developed with English-speaking users in mind, performing well in English and other wide-spread languages while less-resourced languages such as Luxembourgish are seen as a lower priority. This lack of attention is also reflected in the sparsity of available evaluation tools and datasets. In this study, we investigate the viability of language proficiency exams as such evaluation tools for the Luxembourgish language. We find that large models such as ChatGPT, Claude and DeepSeek-R1 typically achieve high scores, while smaller models show weak performances. We also find that the performances in such language exams can be used to predict performances in other NLP tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 2 figures, 11 tables</p></details> |

Despite the remarkable success, existing LLM-empowered RecSys have been demonstrated to be highly vulnerable to minor perturbations. To mitigate the negative impact of such vulnerabilities, one potential solution is to employ collaborative signals based on item-item co-occurrence to purify the malicious collaborative knowledge from the user's historical interactions inserted by attackers. On the other hand, due to the capabilities to expand insufficient internal knowledge of LLMs, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques provide unprecedented opportunities to enhance the robustness of LLM-empowered recommender systems by introducing external collaborative knowledge. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel framework (RETURN) by retrieving external collaborative signals to purify the poisoned user profiles and enhance the robustness of LLM-empowered RecSys in a plug-and-play manner. Specifically, retrieval-augmented perturbation positioning is proposed to identify potential perturbations within the users' historical sequences by retrieving external knowledge from collaborative item graphs. After that, we further retrieve the collaborative knowledge to cleanse the perturbations by using either deletion or replacement strategies and introduce a robust ensemble recommendation strategy to generate final robust predictions. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed RETURN.</p></details> |  |

Modern LLMs are useful tools for ideation and exploration, but current chat-based user interfaces restrict users to a single linear flow. To address this limitation, we propose Narrative Studio -- a novel in-browser narrative exploration environment featuring a tree-like interface that allows branching exploration from user-defined points in a story. Each branch is extended via iterative LLM inference guided by system and user-defined prompts. Additionally, we employ Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to automatically expand promising narrative paths based on user-specified criteria, enabling more diverse and robust story development. We also allow users to enhance narrative coherence by grounding the generated text in an entity graph that represents the actors and environment of the story.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we systematically evaluate the reasoning capabilities of LLMs in anesthesiology and analyze key factors influencing their performance. To this end, we introduce AnesBench, a cross-lingual benchmark designed to assess anesthesiology-related reasoning across three levels: factual retrieval (System 1), hybrid reasoning (System 1.x), and complex decision-making (System 2). Through extensive experiments, we first explore how model characteristics, including model scale, Chain of Thought (CoT) length, and language transferability, affect reasoning performance. Then, we further evaluate the effectiveness of different training strategies, leveraging our curated anesthesiology-related dataset, including continuous pre-training (CPT) and supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Additionally, we also investigate how the test-time reasoning techniques, such as Best-of-N sampling and beam search, influence reasoning performance, and assess the impact of reasoning-enhanced model distillation, specifically DeepSeek-R1. We will publicly release AnesBench, along with our CPT and SFT training datasets and evaluation code at https://github.com/MiliLab/AnesBench.</p></details> | 23 pages, 9 figures |
| **[The quasi-semantic competence of LLMs: a case study on the part-whole relation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02395v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the extent and depth of the semantic competence of \emph{Large Language Models} (LLMs) is at the center of the current scientific agenda in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Computational Linguistics (CL). We contribute to this endeavor by investigating their knowledge of the \emph{part-whole} relation, a.k.a. \emph{meronymy}, which plays a crucial role in lexical organization, but it is significantly understudied. We used data from ConceptNet relations \citep{speer2016conceptnet} and human-generated semantic feature norms \citep{McRae:2005} to explore the abilities of LLMs to deal with \textit{part-whole} relations. We employed several methods based on three levels of analysis: i.) \textbf{behavioral} testing via prompting, where we directly queried the models on their knowledge of meronymy, ii.) sentence \textbf{probability} scoring, where we tested models' abilities to discriminate correct (real) and incorrect (asymmetric counterfactual) \textit{part-whole} relations, and iii.) \textbf{concept representation} analysis in vector space, where we proved the linear organization of the \textit{part-whole} concept in the embedding and unembedding spaces. These analyses present a complex picture that reveals that the LLMs' knowledge of this relation is only partial. They have just a ``\emph{quasi}-semantic'' competence and still fall short of capturing deep inferential properties.</p></details> |  |
| **[ICPL: Few-shot In-context Preference Learning via LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17233v3)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Preference-based reinforcement learning is an effective way to handle tasks where rewards are hard to specify but can be exceedingly inefficient as preference learning is often tabula rasa. We demonstrate that Large Language Models (LLMs) have native preference-learning capabilities that allow them to achieve sample-efficient preference learning, addressing this challenge. We propose In-Context Preference Learning (ICPL), which uses in-context learning capabilities of LLMs to reduce human query inefficiency. ICPL uses the task description and basic environment code to create sets of reward functions which are iteratively refined by placing human feedback over videos of the resultant policies into the context of an LLM and then requesting better rewards. We first demonstrate ICPL's effectiveness through a synthetic preference study, providing quantitative evidence that it significantly outperforms baseline preference-based methods with much higher performance and orders of magnitude greater efficiency. We observe that these improvements are not solely coming from LLM grounding in the task but that the quality of the rewards improves over time, indicating preference learning capabilities. Additionally, we perform a series of real human preference-learning trials and observe that ICPL extends beyond synthetic settings and can work effectively with humans-in-the-loop.</p></details> |  |
| **[Toward General and Robust LLM-enhanced Text-attributed Graph Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02343v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and the proliferation of Text-Attributed Graphs (TAGs) across various domains have positioned LLM-enhanced TAG learning as a critical research area. By utilizing rich graph descriptions, this paradigm leverages LLMs to generate high-quality embeddings, thereby enhancing the representational capacity of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). However, the field faces significant challenges: (1) the absence of a unified framework to systematize the diverse optimization perspectives arising from the complex interactions between LLMs and GNNs, and (2) the lack of a robust method capable of handling real-world TAGs, which often suffer from texts and edge sparsity, leading to suboptimal performance. To address these challenges, we propose UltraTAG, a unified pipeline for LLM-enhanced TAG learning. UltraTAG provides a unified comprehensive and domain-adaptive framework that not only organizes existing methodologies but also paves the way for future advancements in the field. Building on this framework, we propose UltraTAG-S, a robust instantiation of UltraTAG designed to tackle the inherent sparsity issues in real-world TAGs. UltraTAG-S employs LLM-based text propagation and text augmentation to mitigate text sparsity, while leveraging LLM-augmented node selection techniques based on PageRank and edge reconfiguration strategies to address edge sparsity. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that UltraTAG-S significantly outperforms existing baselines, achieving improvements of 2.12\% and 17.47\% in ideal and sparse settings, respectively. Moreover, as the data sparsity ratio increases, the performance improvement of UltraTAG-S also rises, which underscores the effectiveness and robustness of UltraTAG-S.</p></details> |  |

However, most LLM-based methods often narrowly focus on SQL generation, neglecting the complexities of real-world conversational queries. This oversight can lead to unreliable responses, particularly for ambiguous questions that cannot be directly addressed with SQL. To bridge this gap, we propose MMSQL, a comprehensive test suite designed to evaluate the question classification and SQL generation capabilities of LLMs by simulating real-world scenarios with diverse question types and multi-turn Q\&A interactions. Using MMSQL, we assessed the performance of popular LLMs, including both open-source and closed-source models, and identified key factors impacting their performance in such scenarios. Moreover, we introduce an LLM-based multi-agent framework that employs specialized agents to identify question types and determine appropriate answering strategies. Our experiments demonstrate that this approach significantly enhances the model's ability to navigate the complexities of conversational dynamics, effectively handling the diverse and complex nature of user queries. Our dataset and code are publicly available at https://mcxiaoxiao.github.io/MMSQL.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inter...</summary><p>International Joint Conference on Neural Networks 2025 (IJCNN 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Unlocking LLM Repair Capabilities in Low-Resource Programming Languages Through Cross-Language Translation and Multi-Agent Refinement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22512v2)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in leveraging LLMs for APR have demonstrated impressive capabilities in fixing software defects. However, current LLM-based approaches predominantly focus on mainstream programming languages like Java and Python, neglecting less prevalent but emerging languages such as Rust due to expensive training resources, limited datasets, and insufficient community support. This narrow focus creates a significant gap in repair capabilities across the programming language spectrum, where the full potential of LLMs for comprehensive multilingual program repair remains largely unexplored. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel cross-language program repair approach LANTERN that leverages LLMs' differential proficiency across languages through a multi-agent iterative repair paradigm. Our technique strategically translates defective code from languages where LLMs exhibit weaker repair capabilities to languages where they demonstrate stronger performance, without requiring additional training. A key innovation of our approach is an LLM-based decision-making system that dynamically selects optimal target languages based on bug characteristics and continuously incorporates feedback from previous repair attempts. We evaluate our method on xCodeEval, a comprehensive multilingual benchmark comprising 5,068 bugs across 11 programming languages. Results demonstrate significant enhancement in repair effectiveness, particularly for underrepresented languages, with Rust showing a 22.09% improvement in Pass@10 metrics. Our research provides the first empirical evidence that cross-language translation significantly expands the repair capabilities of LLMs and effectively bridges the performance gap between programming languages with different levels of popularity, opening new avenues for truly language-agnostic automated program repair.</p></details> |  |
| **[Measurement of LLM's Philosophies of Human Nature](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02304v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread application of artificial intelligence (AI) in various tasks, along with frequent reports of conflicts or violations involving AI, has sparked societal concerns about interactions with AI systems. Based on Wrightsman's Philosophies of Human Nature Scale (PHNS), a scale empirically validated over decades to effectively assess individuals' attitudes toward human nature, we design the standardized psychological scale specifically targeting large language models (LLM), named the Machine-based Philosophies of Human Nature Scale (M-PHNS). By evaluating LLMs' attitudes toward human nature across six dimensions, we reveal that current LLMs exhibit a systemic lack of trust in humans, and there is a significant negative correlation between the model's intelligence level and its trust in humans. Furthermore, we propose a mental loop learning framework, which enables LLM to continuously optimize its value system during virtual interactions by constructing moral scenarios, thereby improving its attitude toward human nature. Experiments demonstrate that mental loop learning significantly enhances their trust in humans compared to persona or instruction prompts. This finding highlights the potential of human-based psychological assessments for LLM, which can not only diagnose cognitive biases but also provide a potential solution for ethical learning in artificial intelligence. We release the M-PHNS evaluation code and data at https://github.com/kodenii/M-PHNS.</p></details> |  |

Meanwhile, evolutionary algorithms have traditionally relied on fixed rules and pre-defined building blocks. The Large Language Model (LLM)-Guided Evolution (GE) framework transformed this approach by incorporating LLMs to directly modify model source code for image classification algorithms on CIFAR data and intelligently guide mutations and crossovers. A key element of LLM-GE is the "Evolution of Thought" (EoT) technique, which establishes feedback loops, allowing LLMs to refine their decisions iteratively based on how previous operations performed. In this study, we perform NAS for object detection by improving LLM-GE to modify the architecture of You Only Look Once (YOLO) models to enhance performance on the KITTI dataset. Our approach intelligently adjusts the design and settings of YOLO to find the optimal algorithms against objective such as detection accuracy and speed. We show that LLM-GE produced variants with significant performance improvements, such as an increase in Mean Average Precision from 92.5% to 94.5%. This result highlights the flexibility and effectiveness of LLM-GE on real-world challenges, offering a novel paradigm for automated machine learning that combines LLM-driven reasoning with evolutionary strategies.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we investigate how an LLM, acting as an autonomous agent, leverages semantic ambiguity to generate deceptive puzzles that mislead and challenge human users. Inspired by the popular puzzle game "Connections", we systematically compare puzzles produced through zero-shot prompting, role-injected adversarial prompts, and human-crafted examples, with an emphasis on understanding the underlying agent decision-making processes. Employing computational analyses with HateBERT to quantify semantic ambiguity, alongside subjective human evaluations, we demonstrate that explicit adversarial agent behaviors significantly heighten semantic ambiguity -- thereby increasing cognitive load and reducing fairness in puzzle solving. These findings provide critical insights into the emergent agentic qualities of LLMs and underscore important ethical considerations for evaluating and safely deploying autonomous language systems in both educational technologies and entertainment.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

However, results to date have been limited, and few social scientists have adopted these methods. In this position paper, we argue that the promise of LLM social simulations can be achieved by addressing five tractable challenges. We ground our argument in a literature survey of empirical comparisons between LLMs and human research subjects, commentaries on the topic, and related work. We identify promising directions with prompting, fine-tuning, and complementary methods. We believe that LLM social simulations can already be used for exploratory research, such as pilot experiments for psychology, economics, sociology, and marketing. More widespread use may soon be possible with rapidly advancing LLM capabilities, and researchers should prioritize developing conceptual models and evaluations that can be iteratively deployed and refined at pace with ongoing AI advances.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can AI Solve the Peer Review Crisis? A Large Scale Cross Model Experiment of LLMs' Performance and Biases in Evaluating over 1000 Economics Papers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00070v2)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study examines the potential of large language models (LLMs) to augment the academic peer review process by reliably evaluating the quality of economics research without introducing systematic bias. We conduct one of the first large-scale experimental assessments of four LLMs (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5, Gemma 3, and LLaMA 3.3) across two complementary experiments. In the first, we use nonparametric binscatter and linear regression techniques to analyze over 29,000 evaluations of 1,220 anonymized papers drawn from 110 economics journals excluded from the training data of current LLMs, along with a set of AI-generated submissions. The results show that LLMs consistently distinguish between higher- and lower-quality research based solely on textual content, producing quality gradients that closely align with established journal prestige measures. Claude and Gemma perform exceptionally well in capturing these gradients, while GPT excels in detecting AI-generated content. The second experiment comprises 8,910 evaluations designed to assess whether LLMs replicate human like biases in single blind reviews. By systematically varying author gender, institutional affiliation, and academic prominence across 330 papers, we find that GPT, Gemma, and LLaMA assign significantly higher ratings to submissions from top male authors and elite institutions relative to the same papers presented anonymously. These results emphasize the importance of excluding author-identifying information when deploying LLMs in editorial screening. Overall, our findings provide compelling evidence and practical guidance for integrating LLMs into peer review to enhance efficiency, improve accuracy, and promote equity in the publication process of economics research.</p></details> | 58 pages |

While user-written comments provide explicit insights about preferences, merging these textual representations from large language models (LLMs) with graph-based embeddings of user actions remains a challenging task. In this work, we propose a framework that employs both a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based model and an LLM to produce review-aware representations, preserving review semantics while mitigating textual noise. Our approach utilizes a hybrid objective that balances user-item interactions against text-derived features, ensuring that user's both behavioral and linguistic signals are effectively captured. We evaluate this method on multiple datasets from diverse application domains, demonstrating consistent improvements over a baseline GNN-based recommender model. Notably, our model achieves significant gains in recommendation accuracy when review data is sparse or unevenly distributed. These findings highlight the importance of integrating LLM-driven textual feedback with GNN-derived user behavioral patterns to develop robust, context-aware recommender systems.</p></details> | Under Review |

A Case Study in Online Learning and Games](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16843v4)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly employed for (interactive) decision-making, via the development of LLM-based autonomous agents. Despite their emerging successes, the performance of LLM agents in decision-making has not been fully investigated through quantitative metrics, especially in the multi-agent setting when they interact with each other, a typical scenario in real-world LLM-agent applications. To better understand the limits of LLM agents in these interactive environments, we propose to study their interactions in benchmark decision-making settings in online learning and game theory, through the performance metric of \emph{regret}. We first empirically study the {no-regret} behaviors of LLMs in canonical (non-stationary) online learning problems, as well as the emergence of equilibria when LLM agents interact through playing repeated games. We then provide some theoretical insights into the no-regret behaviors of LLM agents, under certain assumptions on the supervised pre-training and the rationality model of human decision-makers who generate the data. Notably, we also identify (simple) cases where advanced LLMs such as GPT-4 fail to be no-regret. To promote the no-regret behaviors, we propose a novel \emph{unsupervised} training loss of \emph{regret-loss}, which, in contrast to the supervised pre-training loss, does not require the labels of (optimal) actions. We then establish the statistical guarantee of generalization bound for regret-loss minimization, followed by the optimization guarantee that minimizing such a loss may automatically lead to known no-regret learning algorithms. Our further experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our regret-loss, especially in addressing the above ``regrettable'' cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>Camer...</summary><p>Camera ready version of ICLR 2025</p></details> |

A key prerequisite to developing these safeguards is understanding the ability of these AI assistants to mislead human teammates. We investigate this attack problem within the context of an intellective strategy game where a team of three humans and one AI assistant collaborate to answer a series of trivia questions. Unbeknownst to the humans, the AI assistant is adversarial. Leveraging techniques from Model-Based Reinforcement Learning (MBRL), the AI assistant learns a model of the humans' trust evolution and uses that model to manipulate the group decision-making process to harm the team. We evaluate two models -- one inspired by literature and the other data-driven -- and find that both can effectively harm the human team. Moreover, we find that in this setting our data-driven model is capable of accurately predicting how human agents appraise their teammates given limited information on prior interactions. Finally, we compare the performance of state-of-the-art LLM models to human agents on our influence allocation task to evaluate whether the LLMs allocate influence similarly to humans or if they are more robust to our attack. These results enhance our understanding of decision-making dynamics in small human-AI teams and lay the foundation for defense strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 9 figures, accepted to ICLR 2025 Workshop on Human-AI Coevolution</p></details> |

However, effectively deploying LLMs requires careful management of stringent data governance requirements, heightened demands for interpretability, ethical responsibilities, and rapidly evolving regulatory landscapes. To address these challenges, we introduce a structured six-decision framework specifically designed for the financial sector, guiding organizations systematically from initial feasibility assessments to final deployment strategies. The framework encourages institutions to: (1) evaluate whether an advanced LLM is necessary at all, (2) formalize robust data governance and privacy safeguards, (3) establish targeted risk management mechanisms, (4) integrate ethical considerations early in the development process, (5) justify the initiative's return on investment (ROI) and strategic value, and only then (6) choose the optimal implementation pathway -- open-source versus proprietary, or in-house versus vendor-supported -- aligned with regulatory requirements and operational realities. By linking strategic considerations with practical steps such as pilot testing, maintaining comprehensive audit trails, and conducting ongoing compliance evaluations, this decision framework offers a structured roadmap for responsibly leveraging LLMs. Rather than acting as a rigid, one-size-fits-all solution, it shows how advanced language models can be thoughtfully integrated into existing workflows -- balancing innovation with accountability to uphold stakeholder trust and regulatory integrity.</p></details> | 27 pages, 3 figures |

On the other hand, specialized solvers like LaMBO-2 offer efficiency and fine-grained control but require more domain expertise. Comparing these approaches is challenging due to expensive laboratory validation and inadequate synthetic benchmarks. We address this by introducing Ehrlich functions, a synthetic test suite that captures the geometric structure of biophysical sequence optimization problems. With prompting alone, off-the-shelf LLMs struggle to optimize Ehrlich functions. In response, we propose LLOME (Language Model Optimization with Margin Expectation), a bilevel optimization routine for online black-box optimization. When combined with a novel preference learning loss, we find LLOME can not only learn to solve some Ehrlich functions, but can even outperform LaMBO-2 on moderately difficult Ehrlich variants. However, LLOME is comparable to LaMBO-2 on very easy or difficult variants, exhibits some likelihood-reward miscalibration, and struggles without explicit rewards. Our results indicate LLMs can provide significant benefits in some cases, but specialized solvers are still competitive and incur less overhead.</p></details> | <details><summary>Super...</summary><p>Supercedes arXiv:2407.00236v1. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2407.00236</p></details> |

Although recent approaches using Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly improved Table QA performance, their explanations for how the answers are generated are ambiguous. To fill this gap, we introduce Plan-of-SQLs (POS), an interpretable Table QA approach designed to improve users' understanding of model decision-making. Through qualitative and quantitative evaluations with human and LLM judges, we show that: First, POS is the highest-quality explanation method, helps human users understand model behaviors, and facilitates model prediction verification. Second, when evaluated on popular and standard Table QA datasets (TabFact, WikiTQ, and FetaQA), POS achieves QA accuracy that is competitive with or superior to existing methods, while also offering greater efficiency-requiring significantly fewer LLM calls and table database queries-and robust performance on large-sized tables. Finally, we observe high agreement (up to 90%) between LLMs and human users when making decisions based on the same explanations, suggesting that LLMs could serve as an effective proxy for humans in evaluating explanations. This finding enables faster, more affordable evaluation of AI explanations-possibly accelerating trustworthy AI research while maintaining reliable judgments on interpretability.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 2 figures and 9 tables in the main text</p></details> |

The unbounded complexity of the driving context, including unforeseeable events, necessitate continuous improvement, often achieved through iterative DevOps processes. However, DevOps processes are themselves complex, making these improvements both time- and resource-intensive. Automation in code generation for ADS using Large Language Models (LLM) is one potential approach to address this challenge. Nevertheless, the development of ADS requires rigorous processes to verify, validate, assess, and qualify the code before it can be deployed in the vehicle and used. In this study, we developed and evaluated a prototype for automatic code generation and assessment using a designed pipeline of a LLM-based agent, simulation model, and rule-based feedback generator in an industrial setup. The LLM-generated code is evaluated automatically in a simulation model against multiple critical traffic scenarios, and an assessment report is provided as feedback to the LLM for modification or bug fixing. We report about the experimental results of the prototype employing Codellama:34b, DeepSeek (r1:32b and Coder:33b), CodeGemma:7b, Mistral:7b, and GPT4 for Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) and Unsupervised Collision Avoidance by Evasive Manoeuvre (CAEM).

Our method eliminates the need for explicit performance matrices by utilizing the inherent knowledge and reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Through extensive experiments with LLaMA, GPT and Gemini, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional meta-learning techniques and heuristic baselines, while significantly reducing computational overhead.

This paper explores quantization-based optimization techniques to enable high-throughput, energy-efficient execution of LLMs on low-power embedded systems. Our approach leverages k-quantization, a Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) method designed for different bit-widths, enabling efficient 2-bit, 4-bit, 6-bit, and 8-bit weight quantization. Additionally, we employ ternary quantization using Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) for BitNet models, allowing for more effective adaptation to lower-bit representations while preserving accuracy. Our findings highlight the potential of quantized LLMs for real-time conversational AI on edge devices, paving the way for low-power, high-efficiency AI deployment in mobile and embedded applications. This study demonstrates that aggressive quantization strategies can significantly reduce energy consumption while maintaining inference quality, making LLMs practical for resource-limited environments.</p></details> |  |

Using the GSM8K dataset as a controlled testbed, we evaluate how well state-of-the-art models maintain logical consistency and correctness when confronted with four categories of prompt perturbations: irrelevant context, pathological instructions, factually relevant but non-essential context, and a combination of the latter two. Our experiments, conducted on thirteen open-source and closed-source LLMs, reveal that introducing irrelevant context within the model's context window significantly degrades performance, suggesting that distinguishing essential from extraneous details remains a pressing challenge. Surprisingly, performance regressions are relatively insensitive to the complexity of the reasoning task, as measured by the number of steps required, and are not strictly correlated with model size. Moreover, we observe that certain perturbations inadvertently trigger chain-of-thought-like reasoning behaviors, even without explicit prompting. Our findings highlight critical vulnerabilities in current LLMs and underscore the need for improved robustness against noisy, misleading, and contextually dense inputs, paving the way for more resilient and reliable reasoning in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

We investigate evaluation strategies and update methods for LLMs as new data becomes available. We introduce a web-scale dataset for time-continual pretraining of LLMs derived from 114 dumps of Common Crawl (CC) - orders of magnitude larger than previous continual language modeling benchmarks. We also design time-stratified evaluations across both general CC data and specific domains (Wikipedia, StackExchange, and code documentation) to assess how well various continual learning methods adapt to new data while retaining past knowledge. Our findings demonstrate that, on general CC data, autoregressive meta-schedules combined with a fixed-ratio replay of older data can achieve comparable held-out loss to re-training from scratch, while requiring significantly less computation (2.6x). However, the optimal balance between incorporating new data and replaying old data differs as replay is crucial to avoid forgetting on generic web data but less so on specific domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available at: https://github.com/apple/ml-tic-lm</p></details> |

We demonstrate the versatility of OmniScience by developing a battery agent that efficiently ranks molecules as potential electrolyte solvents or additives. Comprehensive evaluations reveal that OmniScience is competitive with state-of-the-art large reasoning models on the GPQA Diamond and domain-specific battery benchmarks, while outperforming all public reasoning and non-reasoning models with similar parameter counts. We further demonstrate via ablation experiments that domain adaptive pretraining and reasoning-based knowledge distillation are critical to attain our performance levels, across benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

While deep graph-based models demonstrate strong predictive power, their performance often comes at the cost of high computational overhead and substantial training data requirements, making them impractical for deployment in resource-constrained or data-scarce environments. We propose the FlowDistill, a lightweight and scalable traffic prediction framework based on knowledge distillation from large language models (LLMs). In this teacher-student setup, a fine-tuned LLM guides a compact multi-layer perceptron (MLP) student model using a novel combination of the information bottleneck principle and teacher-bounded regression loss, ensuring the distilled model retains only essential and transferable knowledge. Spatial and temporal correlations are explicitly encoded to enhance the model's generalization across diverse urban settings. Despite its simplicity, FlowDistill consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models in prediction accuracy while requiring significantly less training data, and achieving lower memory usage and inference latency, highlighting its efficiency and suitability for real-world, scalable deployment.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces a novel approach to interpreting LLMs by applying inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) to recover their implicit reward functions. We conduct experiments on toxicity-aligned LLMs of varying sizes, extracting reward models that achieve up to 85\% accuracy in predicting human preferences. Our analysis reveals key insights into the non-identifiability of reward functions, the relationship between model size and interpretability, and potential pitfalls in the RLHF process. We demonstrate that IRL-derived reward models can be used to fine-tune new LLMs, resulting in comparable or improved performance on toxicity benchmarks. This work provides a new lens for understanding and improving LLM alignment, with implications for the responsible development and deployment of these powerful systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

In this paper, we present a comprehensive security analysis of large language models (LLMs), addressing critical research questions on the evolution and determinants of model safety. Specifically, we begin by identifying the most effective techniques for detecting jailbreak attacks. Next, we investigate whether newer versions of LLMs offer improved security compared to their predecessors. We also assess the impact of model size on overall security and explore the potential benefits of integrating multiple defense strategies to enhance model robustness.

| **[Smart Routing: Cost-Effective Multi-LLM Serving for Multi-Core AIOS](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20576v4)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as service endpoints in systems, the surge in query volume creates significant scheduling challenges. Existing scheduling frameworks mainly target at latency optimization while neglecting the capability of LLMs to serve different level of queries, which could lead to computational resource waste. For example, those simple queries can be safely handled by small, fast and cheap LLMs, while those complex and difficult queries need to be handled by large, slow, and expensive LLMs. This paper addresses this challenge by proposing an efficient capability-cost coordinated scheduling framework, ECCOS, for multi-LLM serving, which explicitly constrains response quality and workload to optimize LLM inference cost. Specifically, it introduces the two-stage scheduling by designing a multi-objective predictor and a constrained optimizer. The predictor estimates both model capabilities and computational costs through training-based and retrieval-based approaches, while the optimizer determines cost-optimal assignments under quality and workload constraints. It also introduces QAServe, a dataset for sample-wise response quality and costs collected by zero-shot prompting different LLMs on knowledge QA and mathematical reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ECCOS improves success rates by 6.30% while reducing costs by 10.15% compared to existing methods, consuming less than 0.5% of LLM response time.

To investigate its impact, we conducted a crowdsourcing study with 450 participants, each completing one of six decision-making tasks spanning public safety, diet and health management, sustainability, and AI ethics. Participants engaged in a multi-prompt conversation with ChatGPT to address the task, allowing us to compare pre-chat intent-based expectations with observed interactions. We found that: 1) Several aspects of pre-chat expectations are closely associated with users' prior experiences with ChatGPT, search engines, and virtual assistants; 2) Prior system experience shapes language use and prompting behavior. Frequent ChatGPT users reduced deictic terms and hedge words and frequently adjusted prompts. Users with rich search experience maintained structured, less-conversational queries with minimal modifications. Users of virtual assistants favored directive, command-like prompts, reinforcing functional fixedness; 3) When the system failed to meet expectations, participants generated more detailed prompts with increased linguistic diversity, reflecting adaptive shifts. These findings suggest that while preconceived expectations constrain early interactions, unmet expectations can motivate behavioral adaptation. With appropriate system support, this may promote broader exploration of LLM capabilities. This work also introduces a typology for user intents in chat search and highlights the importance of mitigating functional fixedness to support more creative and analytical use of LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-Resource Allocation in Multi-Agent LLM Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02051v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the development of LLMs as agents, there is a growing interest in connecting multiple agents into multi-agent systems to solve tasks concurrently, focusing on their role in task assignment and coordination. This paper explores how LLMs can effectively allocate computational tasks among multiple agents, considering factors such as cost, efficiency, and performance. In this work, we address key questions, including the effectiveness of LLMs as orchestrators and planners, comparing their effectiveness in task assignment and coordination. Our experiments demonstrate that LLMs can achieve high validity and accuracy in resource allocation tasks. We find that the planner method outperforms the orchestrator method in handling concurrent actions, resulting in improved efficiency and better utilization of agents. Additionally, we show that providing explicit information about worker capabilities enhances the allocation strategies of planners, particularly when dealing with suboptimal workers.</p></details> |  |
| **[The LLM Wears Prada: Analysing Gender Bias and Stereotypes through Online Shopping Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01951v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the wide and cross-domain adoption of Large Language Models, it becomes crucial to assess to which extent the statistical correlations in training data, which underlie their impressive performance, hide subtle and potentially troubling biases. Gender bias in LLMs has been widely investigated from the perspectives of works, hobbies, and emotions typically associated with a specific gender. In this study, we introduce a novel perspective. We investigate whether LLMs can predict an individual's gender based solely on online shopping histories and whether these predictions are influenced by gender biases and stereotypes. Using a dataset of historical online purchases from users in the United States, we evaluate the ability of six LLMs to classify gender and we then analyze their reasoning and products-gender co-occurrences. Results indicate that while models can infer gender with moderate accuracy, their decisions are often rooted in stereotypical associations between product categories and gender. Furthermore, explicit instructions to avoid bias reduce the certainty of model predictions, but do not eliminate stereotypical patterns. Our findings highlight the persistent nature of gender biases in LLMs and emphasize the need for robust bias-mitigation strategies.</p></details> |  |

However, ensuring the reliability and interpretability of their outputs remains a significant challenge. In our framework, we conceptualize the collaboration between AI and human scientists as a dynamic interplay among three modules: the reasoning module, the interpretation module, and the AI-scientist interaction module. Recognizing that effective physics reasoning demands rigorous logical consistency, quantitative precision, and deep integration with established theoretical models, we introduce the interpretation module to improve the understanding of AI-generated outputs, which is not previously explored in the literature. This module comprises multiple specialized agents, including summarizers, model builders, UI builders, and testers, which collaboratively structure LLM outputs within a physically grounded framework, by constructing a more interpretable science model. A case study demonstrates that our approach enhances transparency, facilitates validation, and strengthens AI-augmented reasoning in scientific discovery.</p></details> |  |

Built on three core principles -- diversity, deliberative reasoning, and rigorous filtering -- STAR-1 aims to address the critical needs for safety alignment in LRMs. Specifically, we begin by integrating existing open-source safety datasets from diverse sources. Then, we curate safety policies to generate policy-grounded deliberative reasoning samples. Lastly, we apply a GPT-4o-based safety scoring system to select training examples aligned with best practices. Experimental results show that fine-tuning LRMs with STAR-1 leads to an average 40% improvement in safety performance across four benchmarks, while only incurring a marginal decrease (e.g., an average of 1.1%) in reasoning ability measured across five reasoning tasks. Extensive ablation studies further validate the importance of our design principles in constructing STAR-1 and analyze its efficacy across both LRMs and traditional LLMs. Our project page is https://ucsc-vlaa.github.io/STAR-1.</p></details> |  |

This ability to reason over time allows us to identify future steps and understand the effects of financial and political decisions on our lives. However, large language models (LLMs) are typically trained on static datasets, limiting their ability to perform effective temporal reasoning. To assess the temporal reasoning capabilities of LLMs, we present the TRANSIENTTABLES dataset, which comprises 3,971 questions derived from over 14,000 tables, spanning 1,238 entities across multiple time periods. We introduce a template-based question-generation pipeline that harnesses LLMs to refine both templates and questions. Additionally, we establish baseline results using state-of-the-art LLMs to create a benchmark. We also introduce novel modeling strategies centered around task decomposition, enhancing LLM performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 Pa...</summary><p>19 Pages. 21 Tables, 1 figure</p></details> |
| **[Automate Strategy Finding with LLM in Quant Investment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06289v2)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite significant progress in deep learning for financial trading, existing models often face instability and high uncertainty, hindering their practical application. Leveraging advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and multi-agent architectures, we propose a novel framework for quantitative stock investment in portfolio management and alpha mining. Our framework addresses these issues by integrating LLMs to generate diversified alphas and employing a multi-agent approach to dynamically evaluate market conditions. This paper proposes a framework where large language models (LLMs) mine alpha factors from multimodal financial data, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of market dynamics. The first module extracts predictive signals by integrating numerical data, research papers, and visual charts. The second module uses ensemble learning to construct a diverse pool of trading agents with varying risk preferences, enhancing strategy performance through a broader market analysis. In the third module, a dynamic weight-gating mechanism selects and assigns weights to the most relevant agents based on real-time market conditions, enabling the creation of an adaptive and context-aware composite alpha formula. Extensive experiments on the Chinese stock markets demonstrate that this framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple financial metrics. The results underscore the efficacy of combining LLM-generated alphas with a multi-agent architecture to achieve superior trading performance and stability. This work highlights the potential of AI-driven approaches in enhancing quantitative investment strategies and sets a new benchmark for integrating advanced machine learning techniques in financial trading can also be applied on diverse markets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Non-Determinism of "Deterministic" LLM Settings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04667v5)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM (large language model) practitioners commonly notice that outputs can vary for the same inputs under settings expected to be deterministic. Yet the questions of how pervasive this is, and with what impact on results, have not to our knowledge been systematically investigated. We investigate non-determinism in five LLMs configured to be deterministic when applied to eight common tasks in across 10 runs, in both zero-shot and few-shot settings. We see accuracy variations up to 15% across naturally occurring runs with a gap of best possible performance to worst possible performance up to 70%. In fact, none of the LLMs consistently delivers repeatable accuracy across all tasks, much less identical output strings. Sharing preliminary results with insiders has revealed that non-determinism perhaps essential to the efficient use of compute resources via co-mingled data in input buffers so this issue is not going away anytime soon. To better quantify our observations, we introduce metrics focused on quantifying determinism, TARr@N for the total agreement rate at N runs over raw output, and TARa@N for total agreement rate of parsed-out answers. Our code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/breckbaldwin/llm-stability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing LLMs in Long Code Translation through Instrumentation and Program State Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02017v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code translation aims to transform code between programming languages while preserving functionality, with applications in cross-platform development and software migration. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have improved code translation, but challenges remain, particularly in inferring program functionality. These issues worsen with longer and more complex code, where current LLMs struggle to handle length and intricate semantics. To evaluate LLMs on long code translation, we introduce LongTrans, a large-scale execution-based benchmark with C++, Java, and Python programs, ranging from hundreds to thousands of tokens. Our empirical study of 12 LLMs reveals a sharp performance decline as code length increases, with even the best-performing model, GPT-4o, achieving only 57.51% computational accuracy. This highlights the need for further research in long code translation. We argue that code translation should maintain invariant functionality while transforming syntax and keywords across languages. Despite differences in appearance, program states should remain consistent throughout execution. To address this, we propose PAST (Program State Alignment augmented Translation), which integrates instrumentation to capture and align program states during translation. This approach is the first to leverage LLMs to insert instrumentation in both original and translated code, tracing program states at runtime. By prompting the LLM to correct errors based on output traces, we mitigate inconsistencies and enhance translation accuracy. Experimental results show significant improvements, with computational accuracy rising from 57.51% to 84.70% for GPT-4o, 50.68% to 69.97% for Mistral-Large-2, and 52.45% to 76.43% for DeepSeek-Coder-V2. These improvements are consistent across models and datasets, with ablation studies confirming the benefits of instrumentation and state alignment.</p></details> | 20 pages |

This paper proposes a novel framework called USER-LLM R1 for a user-aware conversational agent that addresses this challenge through dynamic user profiling and model initiation. Our approach integrates chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning models to iteratively infer user preferences and vision-language models (VLMs) to initialize user profiles from multimodal inputs, enabling personalized interactions from the first encounter. Leveraging a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture, the system dynamically refines user representations within an inherent CoT process, ensuring contextually relevant and adaptive responses. Evaluations on the ElderlyTech-VQA Bench demonstrate significant improvements in ROUGE-1 (+23.2%), ROUGE-2 (+0.6%), and ROUGE-L (+8%) F1 scores over state-of-the-art baselines, with ablation studies underscoring the impact of reasoning model size on performance. Human evaluations further validate the framework's efficacy, particularly for elderly users, where tailored responses enhance engagement and trust. Ethical considerations, including privacy preservation and bias mitigation, are rigorously discussed and addressed to ensure responsible deployment.</p></details> |  |

However, the effectiveness of RL in social reasoning, particularly in Theory of Mind (ToM), the ability to infer others' mental states, remains largely unexplored. In this study, we demonstrate that RL methods effectively unlock ToM reasoning capabilities even in small-scale LLMs (0.5B to 7B parameters). Using a modest dataset comprising 3200 questions across diverse scenarios, our RL-trained 7B model achieves 84.50\% accuracy on the Hi-ToM benchmark, surpassing models like GPT-4o and DeepSeek-v3 despite significantly fewer parameters. While smaller models ($\leq$3B parameters) suffer from reasoning collapse, larger models (7B parameters) maintain stable performance through consistent belief tracking. Additionally, our RL-based models demonstrate robust generalization to higher-order, out-of-distribution ToM problems, novel textual presentations, and previously unseen datasets. These findings highlight RL's potential to enhance social cognitive reasoning, bridging the gap between structured problem-solving and nuanced social inference in LLMs.</p></details> |  |

We introduce Open-Qwen2VL, a fully open-source 2B-parameter Multimodal Large Language Model pre-trained efficiently on 29M image-text pairs using only 220 A100-40G GPU hours. Our approach employs low-to-high dynamic image resolution and multimodal sequence packing to significantly enhance pre-training efficiency. The training dataset was carefully curated using both MLLM-based filtering techniques (e.g., MLM-Filter) and conventional CLIP-based filtering methods, substantially improving data quality and training efficiency. The Open-Qwen2VL pre-training is conducted on academic level 8xA100-40G GPUs at UCSB on 5B packed multimodal tokens, which is 0.36% of 1.4T multimodal pre-training tokens of Qwen2-VL. The final instruction-tuned Open-Qwen2VL outperforms partially-open state-of-the-art MLLM Qwen2-VL-2B on various multimodal benchmarks of MMBench, SEEDBench, MMstar, and MathVista, indicating the remarkable training efficiency of Open-Qwen2VL. We open-source all aspects of our work, including compute-efficient and data-efficient training details, data filtering methods, sequence packing scripts, pre-training data in WebDataset format, FSDP-based training codebase, and both base and instruction-tuned model checkpoints. We redefine "fully open" for multimodal LLMs as the complete release of: 1) the training codebase, 2) detailed data filtering techniques, and 3) all pre-training and supervised fine-tuning data used to develop the model.</p></details> |  |

Understanding user behavior within the comments section is essential for comprehensive user interest modeling. A key factor of user engagement is staytime, which refers to the amount of time that users browse and post comments. Existing watchtime prediction methods struggle to adapt to staytime prediction, overlooking interactions with individual comments and their interrelation. In this paper, we present a micro-video recommendation dataset with video comments (named as KuaiComt) which is collected from Kuaishou platform. correspondingly, we propose a practical framework for comment staytime prediction with LLM-enhanced Comment Understanding (LCU). Our framework leverages the strong text comprehension capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to understand textual information of comments, while also incorporating fine-grained comment ranking signals as auxiliary tasks. The framework is two-staged: first, the LLM is fine-tuned using domain-specific tasks to bridge the video and the comments; second, we incorporate the LLM outputs into the prediction model and design two comment ranking auxiliary tasks to better understand user preference. Extensive offline experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, showing significant improvements on the task of comment staytime prediction. Additionally, online A/B testing further validates the practical benefits on industrial scenario.

To further enhance autonomy and personalization, we introduce a memory system for selecting, storing and retrieving experiences, facilitating generalized reasoning based on knowledge built across different interactions.

From statistical quality flags to LLM-based labeling systems, datasets are divided into categories, frequently reducing to a binary: those passing the filters deemed as valuable examples, others discarded as useless or detrimental. However, a more detailed understanding of the contribution of different kinds of texts to model performance is still largely lacking. In this article, we present the first study utilizing registers (also known as genres) - a widely used standard in corpus linguistics to model linguistic variation - to curate pretraining datasets and investigate the effect of register on the performance of LLMs. We perform comparative studies by training models with register classified data and evaluating them using standard benchmarks, and show that the register of pretraining data substantially affects model performance. We uncover surprising relationships between the pretraining material and the resulting models: using the News register results in subpar performance, and on the contrary, including the Opinion class, covering texts such as reviews and opinion blogs, is highly beneficial. While a model trained on the entire unfiltered dataset outperforms those trained on datasets limited to a single register, combining well-performing registers like How-to-Instructions, Informational Description, and Opinion leads to major improvements. Furthermore, analysis of individual benchmark results reveals key differences in the strengths and drawbacks of specific register classes as pretraining data. These findings show that register is an important explainer of model variation and can facilitate more deliberate future data selection practices.</p></details> |  |

Multi-LLM Repeated Sampling Efficiently Scales Test-Time Compute](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00762v2)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a simple, effective, and cost-efficient strategy to improve LLM performance by scaling test-time compute. Our strategy builds upon the repeated-sampling-then-voting framework, with a novel twist: incorporating multiple models, even weaker ones, to leverage their complementary strengths that potentially arise from diverse training data and paradigms. By using consistency as a signal, our strategy dynamically switches between models. Theoretical analysis highlights the efficiency and performance advantages of our strategy. Extensive experiments on six datasets demonstrate that our strategy not only outperforms self-consistency and state-of-the-art multi-agent debate approaches, but also significantly reduces inference costs. Additionally, ModelSwitch requires only a few comparable LLMs to achieve optimal performance and can be extended with verification methods, demonstrating the potential of leveraging multiple LLMs in the generation-verification paradigm.</p></details> |  |

Existing jailbreaking methods fall into two main categories: template-based and optimization-based methods. The former requires significant manual effort and domain knowledge, while the latter, exemplified by Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG), which seeks to maximize the likelihood of harmful LLM outputs through token-level optimization, also encounters several limitations: requiring white-box access, necessitating pre-constructed affirmative phrase, and suffering from low efficiency. In this paper, we present ECLIPSE, a novel and efficient black-box jailbreaking method utilizing optimizable suffixes. Drawing inspiration from LLMs' powerful generation and optimization capabilities, we employ task prompts to translate jailbreaking goals into natural language instructions. This guides the LLM to generate adversarial suffixes for malicious queries. In particular, a harmfulness scorer provides continuous feedback, enabling LLM self-reflection and iterative optimization to autonomously and efficiently produce effective suffixes. Experimental results demonstrate that ECLIPSE achieves an average attack success rate (ASR) of 0.92 across three open-source LLMs and GPT-3.5-Turbo, significantly surpassing GCG in 2.4 times. Moreover, ECLIPSE is on par with template-based methods in ASR while offering superior attack efficiency, reducing the average attack overhead by 83%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Be ac...</summary><p>Be accepeted as NAACL2025 Findings</p></details> |

Then we introduce FreshBench, a new evaluation framework that employs fresh text and event prediction for assessing LLMs' temporal adaptability, ensuring the evaluation process free from data leakage and subjective bias. The experiment shows significant temporal biases and a decline in performance over time. Our findings reveal that powerful models, while initially superior, tend to decline more rapidly in future generalization. Additionally, powerful open-source models demonstrate better long-term adaptability compared to their closed-source counterparts.

Early efforts have leveraged LLMs' rich knowledge and strong generalization capabilities via in-context learning, where recommendation tasks are framed as prompts. However, LLM performance in recommendation scenarios remains limited due to the mismatch between their pretraining objectives and recommendation tasks, as well as the lack of recommendation-specific data during pretraining. To address these challenges, we propose DPO4Rec, a novel framework that integrates Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) into LLM-enhanced recommendation systems. First, we prompt the LLM to infer user preferences from historical interactions, which are then used to augment traditional ID-based sequential recommendation models. Next, we train a reward model based on knowledge-augmented recommendation architectures to assess the quality of LLM-generated reasoning. Using this, we select the highest- and lowest-ranked responses from N samples to construct a dataset for LLM fine-tuning. Finally, we apply a structure alignment strategy via DPO to align the LLM's outputs with desirable recommendation behavior. Extensive experiments show that DPO4Rec significantly improves re-ranking performance over strong baselines, demonstrating enhanced instruction-following capabilities of LLMs in recommendation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted to ICME 2025</p></details> |

They have recently garnered attention due to their capability to address complex tasks involving both modalities. However, their effectiveness is limited to the knowledge acquired during training, which restricts their practical utility. In this work, we introduce a novel method to enhance the adaptability of MLLMs by integrating external knowledge sources. Our proposed model, Reflective LLaVA (ReflectiVA), utilizes reflective tokens to dynamically determine the need for external knowledge and predict the relevance of information retrieved from an external database. Tokens are trained following a two-stage two-model training recipe. This ultimately enables the MLLM to manage external knowledge while preserving fluency and performance on tasks where external knowledge is not needed. Through our experiments, we demonstrate the efficacy of ReflectiVA for knowledge-based visual question answering, highlighting its superior performance compared to existing methods.

There has been limited study about the assessment of the quality of translations generated by LLMs, including Gemini, GPT and Google Translate. In this study, we address this limitation by using semantic and sentiment analysis of selected LLMs for Indian languages, including Sanskrit, Telugu and Hindi. We select prominent texts that have been well translated by experts and use LLMs to generate their translations to English, and then we provide a comparison with selected expert (human) translations. Our findings suggest that while LLMs have made significant progress in translation accuracy, challenges remain in preserving sentiment and semantic integrity, especially in figurative and philosophical contexts. The sentiment analysis revealed that GPT-4o and GPT-3.5 are better at preserving the sentiments for the Bhagavad Gita (Sanskrit-English) translations when compared to Google Translate. We observed a similar trend for the case of Tamas (Hindi-English) and Maha P (Telugu-English) translations. GPT-4o performs similarly to GPT-3.5 in the translation in terms of sentiments for the three languages. We found that LLMs are generally better at translation for capturing sentiments when compared to Google Translate.</p></details> |  |

Existing LLM-based retrieval methods generate numeric or content-based DocIDs to retrieve docs/ads. However, the one-to-few mapping between numeric IDs and docs, along with the time-consuming content extraction, leads to semantic inefficiency and limits scalability in large-scale corpora. In this paper, we propose the Real-time Ad REtrieval (RARE) framework, which leverages LLM-generated text called Commercial Intentions (CIs) as an intermediate semantic representation to directly retrieve ads for queries in real-time. These CIs are generated by a customized LLM injected with commercial knowledge, enhancing its domain relevance. Each CI corresponds to multiple ads, yielding a lightweight and scalable set of CIs. RARE has been implemented in a real-world online system, handling daily search volumes in the hundreds of millions. The online implementation has yielded significant benefits: a 5.04% increase in consumption, a 6.37% rise in Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV), a 1.28% enhancement in click-through rate (CTR) and a 5.29% increase in shallow conversions.

Existing preliminary explorations of reducing thinking length primarily focus on forcing the thinking process to early exit, rather than adapting the LLM to optimize and consolidate the thinking process, and therefore the length-performance tradeoff observed so far is sub-optimal. To fill this gap, ThinkPrune offers a simple solution that continuously trains the long-thinking LLMs via reinforcement learning (RL) with an added token limit, beyond which any unfinished thoughts and answers will be discarded, resulting in a zero reward. To further preserve model performance, we introduce an iterative length pruning approach, where multiple rounds of RL are conducted, each with an increasingly more stringent token limit. We observed that ThinkPrune results in a remarkable performance-length tradeoff -- on the AIME24 dataset, the reasoning length of DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B can be reduced by half with only 2% drop in performance. We also observed that after pruning, the LLMs can bypass unnecessary steps while keeping the core reasoning process complete.

| **[Extracting Formal Specifications from Documents Using LLMs for Automated Testing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01294v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated testing plays a crucial role in ensuring software security. It heavily relies on formal specifications to validate the correctness of the system behavior. However, the main approach to defining these formal specifications is through manual analysis of software documents, which requires a significant amount of engineering effort from experienced researchers and engineers. Meanwhile, system update further increases the human labor cost to maintain a corresponding formal specification, making the manual analysis approach a time-consuming and error-prone task. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising capabilities in natural language understanding. Yet, the feasibility of using LLMs to automate the extraction of formal specifications from software documents remains unexplored. We conduct an empirical study by constructing a comprehensive dataset comprising 603 specifications from 37 documents across three representative open-source software. We then evaluate the most recent LLMs' capabilities in extracting formal specifications from documents in an end-to-end fashion, including GPT-4o, Claude, and Llama. Our study demonstrates the application of LLMs in formal specification extraction tasks while identifying two major limitations: specification oversimplification and specification fabrication. We attribute these deficiencies to the LLMs' inherent limitations in processing and expressive capabilities, as well as their tendency to fabricate fictional information. Inspired by human cognitive processes, we propose a two-stage method, annotation-then-conversion, to address these challenges. Our method demonstrates significant improvements over the end-to-end method, with a 29.2% increase in the number of correctly extracted specifications and a 14.0% improvement in average accuracy. In particular, our best-performing LLM achieves an accuracy of 71.6%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Grounding Multimodal LLMs to Embodied Agents that Ask for Help with Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00907v2)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied agents operating in real-world environments must interpret ambiguous and under-specified human instructions. A capable household robot should recognize ambiguity and ask relevant clarification questions to infer the user intent accurately, leading to more effective task execution. To study this problem, we introduce the Ask-to-Act task, where an embodied agent must fetch a specific object instance given an ambiguous instruction in a home environment. The agent must strategically ask minimal, yet relevant, clarification questions to resolve ambiguity while navigating under partial observability. To solve this problem, we propose a novel approach that fine-tunes multimodal large language models (MLLMs) as vision-language-action (VLA) policies using online reinforcement learning (RL) with LLM-generated rewards. Our method eliminates the need for large-scale human demonstrations or manually engineered rewards for training such agents. We benchmark against strong zero-shot baselines, including GPT-4o, and supervised fine-tuned MLLMs, on our task. Our results demonstrate that our RL-finetuned MLLM outperforms all baselines by a significant margin ($19.1$-$40.3\%$), generalizing well to novel scenes and tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of adapting MLLMs as VLA agents that can act and ask for help using LLM-generated rewards with online RL.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prompt-Reverse Inconsistency: LLM Self-Inconsistency Beyond Generative Randomness and Prompt Paraphrasing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01282v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While the inconsistency of LLMs is not a novel topic, prior research has predominantly addressed two types of generative inconsistencies: i) Randomness Inconsistency: running the same LLM multiple trials, yielding varying responses; ii) Paraphrase Inconsistency: paraphrased prompts result in different responses from the same LLM. Randomness Inconsistency arises from the inherent randomness due to stochastic sampling in generative models, while Paraphrase Inconsistency is a consequence of the language modeling objectives, where paraphrased prompts alter the distribution of vocabulary logits. This research discovers Prompt-Reverse Inconsistency (PRIN), a new form of LLM self-inconsistency: given a question and a couple of LLM-generated answer candidates, the LLM often has conflicting responses when prompted "Which are correct answers?" and "Which are incorrect answers?". PRIN poses a big concern as it undermines the credibility of LLM-as-a-judge, and suggests a challenge for LLMs to adhere to basic logical rules. We conduct a series of experiments to investigate PRIN, examining the extent of PRIN across different LLMs, methods to mitigate it, potential applications, and its relationship with Randomness Inconsistency and Paraphrase Inconsistency. As the first study to explore PRIN, our findings offer valuable insights into the inner workings of LLMs and contribute to advancing trustworthy AI.</p></details> | 9 pages |

While extensive research has explored the effectiveness of LLMs in supporting student learning, limited studies have examined how these models can assist instructors in designing instructional activities. This work investigates how instructors' expertise in effective activity design can be integrated with LLMs' ability to generate novel and targeted programming problems, facilitating more effective activity creation for programming classrooms. To achieve this, we employ a participatory design approach to develop an instructor-authoring tool that incorporates LLM support, fostering collaboration between instructors and AI in generating programming exercises. This tool also allows instructors to specify common student mistakes and misconceptions, which informs the adaptive feedback generation process. We conduct case studies with three instructors, analyzing how they use our system to design programming problems for their introductory courses. Through these case studies, we assess instructors' perceptions of the usefulness and limitations of LLMs in authoring problem statements for instructional purposes. Additionally, we compare the efficiency, quality, effectiveness, and coverage of designed activities when instructors create problems with and without structured LLM prompting guidelines. Our findings provide insights into the potential of LLMs in enhancing instructor workflows and improving programming education and provide guidelines for designing effective AI-assisted problem-authoring interfaces.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CHI 2025 Workshop on Augmented Educators and AI: Shaping the Future of Human and AI Cooperation in Learning</p></details> |

However, recent approaches to language-guided 3D scene editing either require manual interventions or focus only on appearance modifications without supporting comprehensive scene layout changes. In response, we propose EditRoom, a unified framework capable of executing a variety of layout edits through natural language commands, without requiring manual intervention. Specifically, EditRoom leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for command planning and generates target scenes using a diffusion-based method, enabling six types of edits: rotate, translate, scale, replace, add, and remove. To address the lack of data for language-guided 3D scene editing, we have developed an automatic pipeline to augment existing 3D scene synthesis datasets and introduced EditRoom-DB, a large-scale dataset with 83k editing pairs, for training and evaluation. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms other baselines across all metrics, indicating higher accuracy and coherence in language-guided scene layout editing.</p></details> |  |

As we progress toward an agentic world where LLM-based agents autonomously handle specialized tasks, it becomes crucial for these models to adapt to new tasks without forgetting previously learned information - a challenge known as catastrophic forgetting. This study evaluates the continual fine-tuning of various open-source LLMs with different parameter sizes (specifically models under 10 billion parameters) on key NLU tasks from the GLUE benchmark, including SST-2, MRPC, CoLA, and MNLI. By employing prompt engineering and task-specific adjustments, we assess and compare the models' abilities to retain prior knowledge while learning new tasks. Our results indicate that models such as Phi-3.5-mini exhibit minimal forgetting while maintaining strong learning capabilities, making them well-suited for continual learning environments. Additionally, models like Orca-2-7b and Qwen2.5-7B demonstrate impressive learning abilities and overall performance after fine-tuning. This work contributes to understanding catastrophic forgetting in LLMs and highlights prompting engineering to optimize model performance for continual learning scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Our multi-LLM summarization framework has two fundamentally important steps at each round of conversation: generation and evaluation. These steps are different depending on whether our multi-LLM decentralized summarization is used or centralized. In both our multi-LLM decentralized and centralized strategies, we have k different LLMs that generate diverse summaries of the text. However, during evaluation, our multi-LLM centralized summarization approach leverages a single LLM to evaluate the summaries and select the best one whereas k LLMs are used for decentralized multi-LLM summarization. Overall, we find that our multi-LLM summarization approaches significantly outperform the baselines that leverage only a single LLM by up to 3x. These results indicate the effectiveness of multi-LLM approaches for summarization.</p></details> |  |

When users request that LLMs "cite reputable sources," "express appropriate uncertainty," or "include multiple perspectives," they discover that current interfaces provide no structured way to articulate these preferences. The result is prompt sharing folklore: community-specific copied prompts passed through trust relationships rather than based on measured efficacy. We propose the Epistemic Alignment Framework, a set of ten challenges in knowledge transmission derived from the philosophical literature of epistemology, concerning issues such as evidence quality assessment and calibration of testimonial reliance. The framework serves as a structured intermediary between user needs and system capabilities, creating a common vocabulary to bridge the gap between what users want and what systems deliver. Through a thematic analysis of custom prompts and personalization strategies shared on online communities where these issues are actively discussed, we find users develop elaborate workarounds to address each of the challenges. We then apply our framework to two prominent model providers, OpenAI and Anthropic, through content analysis of their documented policies and product features. Our analysis shows that while these providers have partially addressed the challenges we identified, they fail to establish adequate mechanisms for specifying epistemic preferences, lack transparency about how preferences are implemented, and offer no verification tools to confirm whether preferences were followed. For AI developers, the Epistemic Alignment Framework offers concrete guidance for supporting diverse approaches to knowledge; for users, it works toward information delivery that aligns with their specific needs rather than defaulting to one-size-fits-all approaches.</p></details> |  |

Therefore, there is a need for a tool that translates raw malware data into human-readable descriptions. Developing such a tool accelerates incident response, reduces malware analysts' cognitive load, and enables individuals having limited technical expertise to understand malicious software behaviour. With this objective, we present MaLAware, which automatically summarizes the full spectrum of malicious activity of malware executables. MaLAware processes Cuckoo Sandbox-generated reports using large language models (LLMs) to correlate malignant activities and generate concise summaries explaining malware behaviour. We evaluate the tool's performance on five open-source LLMs. The evaluation uses the human-written malware behaviour description dataset as ground truth. The model's performance is measured using 11 extensive performance metrics, which boosts the confidence of MaLAware's effectiveness. The current version of the tool, i.e., MaLAware, supports Qwen2.5-7B, Llama2-7B, Llama3.1-8B, Mistral-7B, and Falcon-7B, along with the quantization feature for resource-constrained environments. MaLAware lays a foundation for future research in malware behavior explanation, and its extensive evaluation demonstrates LLMs' ability to narrate malware behavior in an actionable and comprehensive manner.</p></details> | Accepted at MSR 2025 |

However, research on bias in code generation remains limited. Existing studies typically identify bias by applying malicious prompts or reusing tasks and dataset originally designed for discriminative models. Given that prior datasets are not fully optimized for code-related tasks, there is a pressing need for benchmarks specifically designed for evaluating code models. In this study, we introduce FairCoder, a novel benchmark for evaluating social bias in code generation. FairCoder explores the bias issue following the pipeline in software development, from function implementation to unit test, with diverse real-world scenarios. Additionally, three metrics are designed to assess fairness performance on this benchmark. We conduct experiments on widely used LLMs and provide a comprehensive analysis of the results. The findings reveal that all tested LLMs exhibit social bias.</p></details> |  |

Benchmarking LLMs' Metacognitive Cultural Intelligence with CQ-Bench](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01127v1)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cultural Intelligence (CQ) refers to the ability to understand unfamiliar cultural contexts-a crucial skill for large language models (LLMs) to effectively engage with globally diverse users. While existing research often focuses on explicitly stated cultural norms, such approaches fail to capture the subtle, implicit values that underlie real-world conversations. To address this gap, we introduce CQ-Bench, a benchmark specifically designed to assess LLMs' capability to infer implicit cultural values from natural conversational contexts. We generate a multi-character conversation-based stories dataset using values from the World Value Survey and GlobalOpinions datasets, with topics including ethical, religious, social, and political. Our dataset construction pipeline includes rigorous validation procedures-incorporation, consistency, and implicitness checks-using GPT-4o, with 98.2% human-model agreement in the final validation. Our benchmark consists of three tasks of increasing complexity: attitude detection, value selection, and value extraction. We find that while o1 and Deepseek-R1 models reach human-level performance in value selection (0.809 and 0.814), they still fall short in nuanced attitude detection, with F1 scores of 0.622 and 0.635, respectively. In the value extraction task, GPT-4o-mini and o3-mini score 0.602 and 0.598, highlighting the difficulty of open-ended cultural reasoning. Notably, fine-tuning smaller models (e.g., LLaMA-3.2-3B) on only 500 culturally rich examples improves performance by over 10%, even outperforming stronger baselines (o3-mini) in some cases. Using CQ-Bench, we provide insights into the current challenges in LLMs' CQ research and suggest practical pathways for enhancing LLMs' cross-cultural reasoning abilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multilingual and Multi-Accent Jailbreaking of Audio LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01094v1)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Audio Language Models (LALMs) have significantly advanced audio understanding but introduce critical security risks, particularly through audio jailbreaks. While prior work has focused on English-centric attacks, we expose a far more severe vulnerability: adversarial multilingual and multi-accent audio jailbreaks, where linguistic and acoustic variations dramatically amplify attack success. In this paper, we introduce Multi-AudioJail, the first systematic framework to exploit these vulnerabilities through (1) a novel dataset of adversarially perturbed multilingual/multi-accent audio jailbreaking prompts, and (2) a hierarchical evaluation pipeline revealing that how acoustic perturbations (e.g., reverberation, echo, and whisper effects) interacts with cross-lingual phonetics to cause jailbreak success rates (JSRs) to surge by up to +57.25 percentage points (e.g., reverberated Kenyan-accented attack on MERaLiON). Crucially, our work further reveals that multimodal LLMs are inherently more vulnerable than unimodal systems: attackers need only exploit the weakest link (e.g., non-English audio inputs) to compromise the entire model, which we empirically show by multilingual audio-only attacks achieving 3.1x higher success rates than text-only attacks. We plan to release our dataset to spur research into cross-modal defenses, urging the community to address this expanding attack surface in multimodality as LALMs evolve.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 6 figures, 15 tables</p></details> |

Our framework emphasizes top-down sector allocation by processing multiple data streams simultaneously, including policy documents, economic indicators, and sentiment patterns. Empirical results demonstrate superior risk-adjusted returns compared to traditional cross momentum strategies, achieving a Sharpe ratio of 2.51 and portfolio return of 8.79% versus -0.61 and -1.39% respectively. These results suggest that LLM-based systematic macro analysis presents a viable approach for enhancing automated portfolio allocation decisions at the sector level.</p></details> |  |
| **[When To Solve, When To Verify: Compute-Optimal Problem Solving and Generative Verification for LLM Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01005v1)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scaling test-time compute has emerged as a key strategy for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), particularly in tasks like mathematical problem-solving. A traditional approach, Self-Consistency (SC), generates multiple solutions to a problem and selects the most common answer via majority voting. Another common method involves scoring each solution with a reward model (verifier) and choosing the best one. Recent advancements in Generative Reward Models (GenRM) reframe verification as a next-token prediction task, enabling inference-time scaling along a new axis. Specifically, GenRM generates multiple verification chains-of-thought to score each solution. Under a limited inference budget, this introduces a fundamental trade-off: should you spend the budget on scaling solutions via SC or generate fewer solutions and allocate compute to verification via GenRM? To address this, we evaluate GenRM against SC under a fixed inference budget. Interestingly, we find that SC is more compute-efficient than GenRM for most practical inference budgets across diverse models and datasets. For instance, GenRM first matches SC after consuming up to 8x the inference compute and requires significantly more compute to outperform it. Furthermore, we derive inference scaling laws for the GenRM paradigm, revealing that compute-optimal inference favors scaling solution generation more aggressively than scaling the number of verifications. Our work provides practical guidance on optimizing test-time scaling by balancing solution generation and verification. The code is available at https://github.com/nishadsinghi/sc-genrm-scaling.</p></details> | 29 pages |

Unlike mathematical reasoning, medical reasoning demands meticulous, verifiable thought processes to ensure reliability and accuracy. However, there is a notable lack of datasets that provide transparent, step-by-step reasoning to validate and enhance the medical reasoning ability of AI models. To bridge this gap, we introduce MedReason, a large-scale high-quality medical reasoning dataset designed to enable faithful and explainable medical problem-solving in large language models (LLMs). We utilize a structured medical knowledge graph (KG) to convert clinical QA pairs into logical chains of reasoning, or ``thinking paths'', which trace connections from question elements to answers via relevant KG entities. Each path is validated for consistency with clinical logic and evidence-based medicine. Our pipeline generates detailed reasoning for various medical questions from 7 medical datasets, resulting in a dataset of 32,682 question-answer pairs, each with detailed, step-by-step explanations. Experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning with our dataset consistently boosts medical problem-solving capabilities, achieving significant gains of up to 7.7% for DeepSeek-Ditill-8B. Our top-performing model, MedReason-8B, outperforms the Huatuo-o1-8B, a state-of-the-art medical reasoning model, by up to 4.2% on the clinical benchmark MedBullets. We also engage medical professionals from diverse specialties to assess our dataset's quality, ensuring MedReason offers accurate and coherent medical reasoning. Our data, models, and code will be publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-Human Pipeline for Cultural Context Grounding of Conversations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13727v2)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conversations often adhere to well-understood social norms that vary across cultures. For example, while "addressing parents by name" is commonplace in the West, it is rare in most Asian cultures. Adherence or violation of such norms often dictates the tenor of conversations. Humans are able to navigate social situations requiring cultural awareness quite adeptly. However, it is a hard task for NLP models. In this paper, we tackle this problem by introducing a "Cultural Context Schema" for conversations. It comprises (1) conversational information such as emotions, dialogue acts, etc., and (2) cultural information such as social norms, violations, etc. We generate ~110k social norm and violation descriptions for ~23k conversations from Chinese culture using LLMs. We refine them using automated verification strategies which are evaluated against culturally aware human judgements. We organize these descriptions into meaningful structures we call "Norm Concepts", using an interactive human-in-loop framework. We ground the norm concepts and the descriptions in conversations using symbolic annotation. Finally, we use the obtained dataset for downstream tasks such as emotion, sentiment, and dialogue act detection. We show that it significantly improves the empirical performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Oral ...</summary><p>Oral at NAACL 2025 Main conference. Albuquerque, USA.

To this end, we introduce M-ALERT, a multilingual benchmark that evaluates the safety of LLMs in five languages: English, French, German, Italian, and Spanish. M-ALERT includes 15k high-quality prompts per language, totaling 75k, following the detailed ALERT taxonomy. Our extensive experiments on 10 state-of-the-art LLMs highlight the importance of language-specific safety analysis, revealing that models often exhibit significant inconsistencies in safety across languages and categories. For instance, Llama3.2 shows high unsafety in the category crime_tax for Italian but remains safe in other languages. Similar differences can be observed across all models. In contrast, certain categories, such as substance_cannabis and crime_propaganda, consistently trigger unsafe responses across models and languages. These findings underscore the need for robust multilingual safety practices in LLMs to ensure safe and responsible usage across diverse user communities.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we concentrate on using adversarial examples to mitigate unauthorized disclosure of speech privacy thwarted by potential eavesdroppers in speech communications. While audio adversarial examples have demonstrated the capability to mislead ASR models or evade ASR surveillance, they are typically constructed through time-intensive offline optimization, restricting their practicality in real-time voice communication. Recent work overcame this limitation by generating universal adversarial perturbations (UAPs) and enhancing their transferability for black-box scenarios. However, they introduced excessive noise that significantly degrades audio quality and affects human perception, thereby limiting their effectiveness in practical scenarios. To address this limitation and protect live users' speech against ASR systems, we propose a novel framework, AudioShield. Central to this framework is the concept of Transferable Universal Adversarial Perturbations in the Latent Space (LS-TUAP). By transferring the perturbations to the latent space, the audio quality is preserved to a large extent. Additionally, we propose target feature adaptation to enhance the transferability of UAPs by embedding target text features into the perturbations. Comprehensive evaluation on four commercial ASR APIs (Google, Amazon, iFlytek, and Alibaba), three voice assistants, two LLM-powered ASR and one NN-based ASR demonstrates the protection superiority of AudioShield over existing competitors, and both objective and subjective evaluations indicate that AudioShield significantly improves the audio quality. Moreover, AudioShield also shows high effectiveness in real-time end-to-end scenarios, and demonstrates strong resilience against adaptive countermeasures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accept to USENIX Security 2025</p></details> |

Real-world tasks require handling intricate interactions, advanced spatial reasoning, long-term planning, and continuous exploration of new strategies-areas in which we lack effective methodologies for comprehensively evaluating these capabilities. To address this gap, we introduce BALROG, a novel benchmark designed to assess the agentic capabilities of LLMs and VLMs through a diverse set of challenging games. Our benchmark incorporates a range of existing reinforcement learning environments with varying levels of difficulty, including tasks that are solvable by non-expert humans in seconds to extremely challenging ones that may take years to master (e.g., the NetHack Learning Environment). We devise fine-grained metrics to measure performance and conduct an extensive evaluation of several popular open-source and closed-source LLMs and VLMs. Our findings indicate that while current models achieve partial success in the easier games, they struggle significantly with more challenging tasks. Notably, we observe severe deficiencies in vision-based decision-making, as several models perform worse when visual representations of the environments are provided. We release BALROG as an open and user-friendly benchmark to facilitate future research and development in the agentic community.

This paper presents a rigorous experimental investigation into how difficulty-aware staged reinforcement learning (RL) strategies can substantially improve LLM reasoning performance. Through systematic analysis, we demonstrate that strategically selecting training data according to well-defined difficulty levels markedly enhances RL optimization. Moreover, we introduce a staged training methodology, progressively exposing models to increasingly challenging tasks, further amplifying reasoning capabilities. Our findings reveal significant cross-domain benefits when simultaneously training models on mathematical reasoning and code generation tasks. Notably, our proposed approach enables a 1.5B parameter model to achieve an accuracy of 42.3\% on the AIME-2024 benchmark, 89.5\% on the MATH-500 benchmark. These results underscore the efficacy of our method in advancing the reasoning proficiency of LLMs. We will open-source our datasets on GitHub and Hugging Face.</p></details> |  |
| **[TOBUGraph: Knowledge Graph-Based Retrieval for Enhanced LLM Performance Beyond RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05447v2)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is one of the leading and most widely used techniques for enhancing LLM retrieval capabilities, but it still faces significant limitations in commercial use cases. RAG primarily relies on the query-chunk text-to-text similarity in the embedding space for retrieval and can fail to capture deeper semantic relationships across chunks, is highly sensitive to chunking strategies, and is prone to hallucinations. To address these challenges, we propose TOBUGraph, a graph-based retrieval framework that first constructs the knowledge graph from unstructured data dynamically and automatically. Using LLMs, TOBUGraph extracts structured knowledge and diverse relationships among data, going beyond RAG's text-to-text similarity. Retrieval is achieved through graph traversal, leveraging the extracted relationships and structures to enhance retrieval accuracy, eliminating the need for chunking configurations while reducing hallucination. We demonstrate TOBUGraph's effectiveness in TOBU, a real-world application in production for personal memory organization and retrieval. Our evaluation using real user data demonstrates that TOBUGraph outperforms multiple RAG implementations in both precision and recall, significantly improving user experience through improved retrieval accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Robust and Parameter-Efficient Knowledge Unlearning for LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06621v4)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong reasoning and memorization capabilities via pretraining on massive textual corpora. However, this poses risk of privacy and copyright violations, highlighting the need for efficient machine unlearning methods that remove sensitive data without retraining from scratch. While Gradient Ascent (GA) is commonly used to unlearn by reducing the likelihood of generating unwanted content, it leads to unstable optimization and catastrophic forgetting of retrained knowledge. We find that combining GA with low-rank adaptation results in poor trade-offs between computational cost and generative performance. To address these challenges, we propose Low-rank Knowledge Unlearning (LoKU), a novel framework that enables robust and efficient unlearning for LLMs. First, we introduce Inverted Hinge Loss, which suppresses unwanted tokens while maintaining fluency by boosting the probability of the next most likely token. Second, we develop a data-adaptive initialization for LoRA adapters via low-rank approximation weighted with relative Fisher information, thereby focusing updates on parameters critical for removing targeted knowledge. Experiments on the Training Data Extraction Challenge dataset using GPT-Neo models as well as on the TOFU benchmark with Phi-1.5B and Llama2-7B models demonstrate that our approach effectively removes sensitive information while maintaining reasoning and generative capabilities with minimal impact. Our implementation can be found in https://github.com/csm9493/efficient-llm-unlearning.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025 camera-ready version</p></details> |
| **[Forest-of-Thought: Scaling Test-Time Compute for Enhancing LLM Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09078v5)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable abilities across various language tasks, but solving complex reasoning problems remains a significant challenge. While existing methods, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tree-of-Thought (ToT), enhance reasoning by decomposing problems or structuring prompts, they typically perform a single pass of reasoning and may fail to revisit flawed paths, compromising accuracy. To address this limitation, we propose a novel reasoning framework called Forest-of-Thought (FoT), which integrates multiple reasoning trees to leverage collective decision-making for solving complex logical problems. FoT employs sparse activation strategies to select the most relevant reasoning paths, improving both efficiency and accuracy. Additionally, we introduce a dynamic self-correction strategy that enables real-time error correction, along with consensus-guided decision-making strategies to optimize both correctness and computational resources. Experimental results demonstrate that the FoT framework, combined with these strategies, significantly enhances the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, enabling them to solve complex tasks with greater precision and efficiency. Code will be available at https://github.com/iamhankai/Forest-of-Thought.</p></details> | Preprint |

To address this, we introduce HRET Haerae Evaluation Toolkit, an open-source, self-evolving evaluation framework tailored specifically for Korean LLMs. HRET unifies diverse evaluation methods, including logit-based scoring, exact-match, language-inconsistency penalization, and LLM-as-a-Judge assessments. Its modular, registry-based architecture integrates major benchmarks (HAE-RAE Bench, KMMLU, KUDGE, HRM8K) and multiple inference backends (vLLM, HuggingFace, OpenAI-compatible endpoints). With automated pipelines for continuous evolution, HRET provides a robust foundation for reproducible, fair, and transparent Korean NLP research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Personality-Driven Decision-Making in LLM-Based Autonomous Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00727v1)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The embedding of Large Language Models (LLMs) into autonomous agents is a rapidly developing field which enables dynamic, configurable behaviours without the need for extensive domain-specific training. In our previous work, we introduced SANDMAN, a Deceptive Agent architecture leveraging the Five-Factor OCEAN personality model, demonstrating that personality induction significantly influences agent task planning. Building on these findings, this study presents a novel method for measuring and evaluating how induced personality traits affect task selection processes - specifically planning, scheduling, and decision-making - in LLM-based agents. Our results reveal distinct task-selection patterns aligned with induced OCEAN attributes, underscoring the feasibility of designing highly plausible Deceptive Agents for proactive cyber defense strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 8 figures.

| **[GraphMaster: Automated Graph Synthesis via LLM Agents in Data-Limited Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00711v1)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The era of foundation models has revolutionized AI research, yet Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) remain constrained by the scarcity of large-scale graph corpora. Traditional graph data synthesis techniques primarily focus on simplistic structural operations, lacking the capacity to generate semantically rich nodes with meaningful textual attributes: a critical limitation for real-world applications. While large language models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional text generation capabilities, their direct application to graph synthesis is impeded by context window limitations, hallucination phenomena, and structural consistency challenges. To address these issues, we introduce GraphMaster, the first multi-agent framework specifically designed for graph data synthesis in data-limited environments. GraphMaster orchestrates four specialized LLM agents (Manager, Perception, Enhancement, and Evaluation) that collaboratively optimize the synthesis process through iterative refinement, ensuring both semantic coherence and structural integrity. To rigorously evaluate our approach, we create new data-limited "Sub" variants of six standard graph benchmarks, specifically designed to test synthesis capabilities under realistic constraints. Additionally, we develop a novel interpretability assessment framework that combines human evaluation with a principled Grassmannian manifold-based analysis, providing both qualitative and quantitative measures of semantic coherence. Experimental results demonstrate that GraphMaster significantly outperforms traditional synthesis methods across multiple datasets, establishing a strong foundation for advancing GFMs in data-scarce environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[On Benchmarking Code LLMs for Android Malware Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00694v1)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in various code intelligence tasks. However, their effectiveness for Android malware analysis remains underexplored. Decompiled Android code poses unique challenges for analysis, primarily due to its large volume of functions and the frequent absence of meaningful function names. This paper presents Cama, a benchmarking framework designed to systematically evaluate the effectiveness of Code LLMs in Android malware analysis tasks. Cama specifies structured model outputs (comprising function summaries, refined function names, and maliciousness scores) to support key malware analysis tasks, including malicious function identification and malware purpose summarization. Built on these, it integrates three domain-specific evaluation metrics, consistency, fidelity, and semantic relevance, enabling rigorous stability and effectiveness assessment and cross-model comparison. We construct a benchmark dataset consisting of 118 Android malware samples, encompassing over 7.5 million distinct functions, and use Cama to evaluate four popular open-source models. Our experiments provide insights into how Code LLMs interpret decompiled code and quantify the sensitivity to function renaming, highlighting both the potential and current limitations of Code LLMs in malware analysis tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, prior work primarily relies on few-shot in-context learning (ICL) with ad-hoc demonstrations, which limit program diversity and require manual design with substantial domain knowledge. Fundamentally, the underlying principles of effective reasoning program generation still remain underexplored, making it challenging to construct effective demonstrations. To address this, we propose BOOST, a bootstrapping-based framework for few-shot reasoning program generation. BOOST explicitly integrates claim decomposition and information-gathering strategies as structural guidance for program generation, iteratively refining bootstrapped demonstrations in a strategy-driven and data-centric manner without human intervention. This enables a seamless transition from zero-shot to few-shot strategic program-guided learning, enhancing interpretability and effectiveness. Experimental results show that BOOST outperforms prior few-shot baselines in both zero-shot and few-shot settings for complex claim verification.</p></details> | 18 pages, 5 figures |

While prior research has primarily focused on improving FC accuracy, little attention has been given to the robustness of these agents to perturbations in their input. We introduce a benchmark assessing FC robustness in two key areas: resilience to naturalistic query variations, and stability in function calling when the toolkit expands with semantically related tools. Evaluating best-performing FC models on a carefully expanded subset of the Berkeley function calling leaderboard (BFCL), we identify critical weaknesses in existing evaluation methodologies, and highlight areas for improvement in real-world agentic deployments.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, TrustNLP@NAACL25</p></details> |
| **[BigCodeBench: Benchmarking Code Generation with Diverse Function Calls and Complex Instructions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15877v4)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Task automation has been greatly empowered by the recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) via Python code, where the tasks ranging from software engineering development to general-purpose reasoning. While current benchmarks have shown that LLMs can solve tasks using programs like human developers, the majority of their evaluations are limited to short and self-contained algorithmic tasks or standalone function calls. Solving challenging and practical tasks requires the capability of utilizing diverse function calls as tools to efficiently implement functionalities like data analysis and web development. In addition, using multiple tools to solve a task needs compositional reasoning by accurately understanding complex instructions. Fulfilling both of these characteristics can pose a great challenge for LLMs.To assess how well LLMs can solve challenging and practical tasks via programs, we introduce BigCodeBench, a benchmark that challenges LLMs to invoke multiple function calls as tools from 139 libraries and 7 domains for 1,140 fine-grained tasks. To evaluate LLMs rigorously, each task encompasses 5.6 test cases with an average branch coverage of 99%. In addition, we propose a natural-language-oriented variant of BigCodeBench, BigCodeBench-Instruct, that automatically transforms the original docstrings into short instructions only with essential information. Our extensive evaluation of 60 LLMs shows that LLMs are not yet capable of following complex instructions to use function calls precisely, with scores up to 60%, significantly lower than the human performance of 97%. The results underscore the need for further advancements in this area.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accpe...</summary><p>Accpeted at ICLR 2025 (Oral), built with love by the BigCode community :)</p></details> |
| **[Phaedrus: Predicting Dynamic Application Behavior with Lightweight Generative Models and LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06994v2)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Application profiling is an indispensable technique for many software development tasks, such as code and memory layout optimizations, where optimization decisions are tailored to specific program profiles. Unfortunately, modern applications codebases exhibit highly variant behavior across different inputs, creating challenges for conventional profiling approaches that rely on a single representative execution instance. In this paper, we propose \textbf{Phaedrus}, a new \textit{compiler-assisted deep learning framework} designed to predict dynamic program behaviors across varied execution instances, specifically focusing on dynamic function call prediction.Such predicted call sequences are then used for producing optimized code pertinent to a given input. Traditional profile-guided optimization methods struggle with the input-dependent variability of modern applications, where profiling on different inputs yields divergent application behaviors. To address this, Phaedrus proposes two new approaches: \textit{Application Behavior Synthesis}, a profile-less approach where Large Language Models (LLMs) directly infer dynamic functions based on source code \& static compiler analysis, bypassing the need for traditional profiling, and \textit{Application Profile Generalization}, which uses generative models trained on compressed and augmented \textit{Whole Program Path} (WPP) based function profiles to predict application behavior under unseen inputs. Our experiments show that \textit{Phaedrus} can achieve upto $10^7X$ reduction in WPP function profile sizes, can predict most frequently executed functions that cover upto 85-99\% of the execution time, along with an average of 13.68\% (upto 65\%) reduction in application binary size, and an average of 2.8\% performance improvement over the traditional profile-guided optimization.</p></details> |  |
| **[How Does A Text Preprocessing Pipeline Affect Ontology Syntactic Matching?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03962v5)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The classic text preprocessing pipeline, comprising Tokenisation, Normalisation, Stop Words Removal, and Stemming/Lemmatisation, has been implemented in many systems for syntactic ontology matching (OM). However, the lack of standardisation in text preprocessing creates diversity in mapping results. In this paper we investigate the effect of the text preprocessing pipeline on syntactic OM in 8 Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI) tracks with 49 distinct alignments. We find that Phase 1 text preprocessing (Tokenisation and Normalisation) is more effective than Phase 2 text preprocessing (Stop Words Removal and Stemming/Lemmatisation). To repair the unwanted false mappings caused by Phase 2 text preprocessing, we propose a novel context-based pipeline repair approach that employs a post hoc check to find common words that cause false mappings. These words are stored in a reserved word set and applied in text preprocessing. The experimental results show that our approach improves the matching correctness and the overall matching performance. We then consider the broader integration of the classic text preprocessing pipeline with modern large language models (LLMs) for OM. We recommend that (1) the text preprocessing pipeline be injected via function calling into LLMs to avoid the tendency towards unstable true mappings produced by LLM prompting; or (2) LLMs be used to repair non-existent and counter-intuitive false mappings generated by the text preprocessing pipeline.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 11 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[CodeARC: Benchmarking Reasoning Capabilities of LLM Agents for Inductive Program Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23145v1)** | 2025-03-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inductive program synthesis, or programming by example, requires synthesizing functions from input-output examples that generalize to unseen inputs. While large language model agents have shown promise in programming tasks guided by natural language, their ability to perform inductive program synthesis is underexplored. Existing evaluation protocols rely on static sets of examples and held-out tests, offering no feedback when synthesized functions are incorrect and failing to reflect real-world scenarios such as reverse engineering. We propose CodeARC, the Code Abstraction and Reasoning Challenge, a new evaluation framework where agents interact with a hidden target function by querying it with new inputs, synthesizing candidate functions, and iteratively refining their solutions using a differential testing oracle. This interactive setting encourages agents to perform function calls and self-correction based on feedback. We construct the first large-scale benchmark for general-purpose inductive program synthesis, featuring 1114 functions. Among 18 models evaluated, o3-mini performs best with a success rate of 52.7%, highlighting the difficulty of this task. Fine-tuning LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct on curated synthesis traces yields up to a 31% relative performance gain. CodeARC provides a more realistic and challenging testbed for evaluating LLM-based program synthesis and inductive reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[CoSIL: Software Issue Localization via LLM-Driven Code Repository Graph Searching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22424v1)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced autonomous software engineering, leading to a growing number of software engineering agents that assist developers in automatic program repair. Issue localization forms the basis for accurate patch generation. However, because of limitations caused by the context window length of LLMs, existing issue localization methods face challenges in balancing concise yet effective contexts and adequately comprehensive search spaces. In this paper, we introduce CoSIL, an LLM driven, simple yet powerful function level issue localization method without training or indexing. CoSIL reduces the search space through module call graphs, iteratively searches the function call graph to obtain relevant contexts, and uses context pruning to control the search direction and manage contexts effectively. Importantly, the call graph is dynamically constructed by the LLM during search, eliminating the need for pre-parsing. Experiment results demonstrate that CoSIL achieves a Top-1 localization success rate of 43 percent and 44.6 percent on SWE bench Lite and SWE bench Verified, respectively, using Qwen2.5 Coder 32B, outperforming existing methods by 8.6 to 98.2 percent. When CoSIL is applied to guide the patch generation stage, the resolved rate further improves by 9.3 to 31.5 percent.</p></details> |  |

In particular, the runtime of the multi-valued cGA (r-cGA) and UMDA on multi-valued functions has been a significant area of study. Adak and Witt (PPSN 2024) and Hamano et al. (ECJ 2024) independently performed a first runtime analysis of the r-cGA on the r-valued OneMax function (r-OneMax). Adak and Witt also introduced a different r-valued OneMax function called G-OneMax. However, for that function, only empirical results were provided so far due to the increased complexity of its runtime analysis, since r-OneMax involves categorical values of two types only, while G-OneMax encompasses all possible values. In this paper, we present the first theoretical runtime analysis of the r-cGA on the G-OneMax function. We demonstrate that the runtime is O(nr^3 log^2 n log r) with high probability. Additionally, we refine the previously established runtime analysis of the r-cGA on r-OneMax, improving the previous bound to O(nr log n log r), which improves the state of the art by an asymptotic factor of log n and is tight for the binary case. Moreover, we for the first time include the case of frequency borders.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at GECCO 2025</p></details> |

With the growing consumption of content using Over-the-Top platforms, such as Netflix or Prime Video, DRMs have been deployed on numerous devices considered as potential hostile environments. In this paper, we focus on the most widespread solution, the closed-source Widevine DRM. Installed on billions of devices, Widevine relies on cryptographic operations to protect content. Our work presents a study of Widevine internals on Android, mapping its distinct components and bringing out its different cryptographic keys involved in content decryption. We provide a structural view of Widevine as a protocol with its complete key ladder. Based on our insights, we develop WideXtractor, a tool based on Frida to trace Widevine function calls and intercept messages for inspection. Using this tool, we analyze Netflix usage of Widevine as a proof-of-concept, and raised privacy concerns on user-tracking. In addition, we leverage our knowledge to bypass the obfuscation of Android Widevine software-only version, namely L3, and recover its Root-of-Trust.</p></details> |  |
| **[Training Domain Draft Models for Speculative Decoding: Best Practices and Insights](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07807v2)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Speculative decoding is an effective method for accelerating inference of large language models (LLMs) by employing a small draft model to predict the output of a target model. However, when adapting speculative decoding to domain-specific target models, the acceptance rate of the generic draft model drops significantly due to domain shift. In this work, we systematically investigate knowledge distillation techniques for training domain draft models to improve their speculation accuracy. We compare white-box and black-box distillation approaches and explore their effectiveness in various data accessibility scenarios, including historical user queries, curated domain data, and synthetically generated alignment data. Our experiments across Function Calling, Biology, and Chinese domains show that offline distillation consistently outperforms online distillation by 11% to 25%, white-box distillation surpasses black-box distillation by 2% to 10%, and data scaling trends hold across domains. Additionally, we find that synthetic data can effectively align draft models and achieve 80% to 93% of the performance of training on historical user queries. These findings provide practical guidelines for training domain-specific draft models to improve speculative decoding efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a workshop paper at SCOPE - ICLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Semantic Entanglement-Based Ransomware Detection via Probabilistic Latent Encryption Mapping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02730v2)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Encryption-based attacks have introduced significant challenges for detection mechanisms that rely on predefined signatures, heuristic indicators, or static rule-based classifications. Probabilistic Latent Encryption Mapping presents an alternative detection framework that models ransomware-induced encryption behaviors through statistical representations of entropy deviations and probabilistic dependencies in execution traces. Unlike conventional approaches that depend on explicit bytecode analysis or predefined cryptographic function call monitoring, probabilistic inference techniques classify encryption anomalies based on their underlying statistical characteristics, ensuring greater adaptability to polymorphic attack strategies. Evaluations demonstrate that entropy-driven classification reduces false positive rates while maintaining high detection accuracy across diverse ransomware families and encryption methodologies. Experimental results further highlight the framework's ability to differentiate between benign encryption workflows and adversarial cryptographic manipulations, ensuring that classification performance remains effective across cloud-based and localized execution environments. Benchmark comparisons illustrate that probabilistic modeling exhibits advantages over heuristic and machine learning-based detection approaches, particularly in handling previously unseen encryption techniques and adversarial obfuscation strategies. Computational efficiency analysis confirms that detection latency remains within operational feasibility constraints, reinforcing the viability of probabilistic encryption classification for real-time security infrastructures. The ability to systematically infer encryption-induced deviations without requiring static attack signatures strengthens detection robustness against adversarial evasion techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: This paper has been withdrawn by arXiv due to disputed and unverifiable authorship</p></details> |
| **[Interference Minimization in Beyond-Diagonal RIS-assisted MIMO Interference Channels](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19547v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a two-stage approach for passive and active beamforming in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) interference channels (ICs) assisted by a beyond-diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS). In the first stage, the passive BD-RIS is designed to minimize the aggregate interference power at all receivers, a cost function called interference leakage (IL). To this end, we propose an optimization algorithm in the manifold of unitary matrices and a suboptimal but computationally efficient solution. In the second stage, users' active precoders are designed under different criteria such as minimizing the IL (min-IL), maximizing the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (max-SINR), or maximizing the sum rate (max-SR). The residual interference not cancelled by the BD-RIS is treated as noise by the precoders. Our simulation results show that the max-SR precoders provide more than 20% sum rate improvement compared to other designs, especially when the BD-RIS has a moderate number of elements ($M<20$) and users transmit with high power, in which case the residual interference is still significant.</p></details> | 13 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Towards Practical Real-Time Neural Video Compression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20762v2)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a practical real-time neural video codec (NVC) designed to deliver high compression ratio, low latency and broad versatility. In practice, the coding speed of NVCs depends on 1) computational costs, and 2) non-computational operational costs, such as memory I/O and the number of function calls. While most efficient NVCs prioritize reducing computational cost, we identify operational cost as the primary bottleneck to achieving higher coding speed. Leveraging this insight, we introduce a set of efficiency-driven design improvements focused on minimizing operational costs. Specifically, we employ implicit temporal modeling to eliminate complex explicit motion modules, and use single low-resolution latent representations rather than progressive downsampling. These innovations significantly accelerate NVC without sacrificing compression quality. Additionally, we implement model integerization for consistent cross-device coding and a module-bank-based rate control scheme to improve practical adaptability. Experiments show our proposed DCVC-RT achieves an impressive average encoding/decoding speed at 125.2/112.8 fps (frames per second) for 1080p video, while saving an average of 21% in bitrate compared to H.266/VTM.

TAPS can effectively obtain surrogate models for high-dimensional parametric problems with equivalent zetta-scale ($10^{21}$) degrees of freedom (DoFs). TAPS achieves this by directly obtaining reduced-order models through solving governing equations with multiple independent variables such as spatial coordinates, parameters, and time. The paper first introduces an AI-enhanced finite element-type interpolation function called convolution hierarchical deep-learning neural network (C-HiDeNN) with tensor decomposition (TD). Subsequently, the generalized space-parameter-time Galerkin weak form and the corresponding matrix form are derived. Through the choice of TAPS hyperparameters, an arbitrary convergence rate can be achieved. To show the capabilities of this framework, TAPS is then used to simulate a large-scale additive manufacturing process as an example and achieves around 1,370x speedup, 14.8x memory savings, and 955x storage gain compared to the finite difference method with $3.46$ billion spatial degrees of freedom (DoFs). As a result, the TAPS framework opens a new avenue for many challenging ultra large-scale engineering problems, such as additive manufacturing and integrated circuit design, among others.</p></details> |  |
| **[Benchmarking LLMs and LLM-based Agents in Practical Vulnerability Detection for Code Repositories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03586v2)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in software vulnerability detection, particularly on function-level benchmarks like Devign and BigVul. However, real-world detection requires interprocedural analysis, as vulnerabilities often emerge through multi-hop function calls rather than isolated functions. While repository-level benchmarks like ReposVul and VulEval introduce interprocedural context, they remain computationally expensive, lack pairwise evaluation of vulnerability fixes, and explore limited context retrieval, limiting their practicality. We introduce JitVul, a JIT vulnerability detection benchmark linking each function to its vulnerability-introducing and fixing commits. Built from 879 CVEs spanning 91 vulnerability types, JitVul enables comprehensive evaluation of detection capabilities. Our results show that ReAct Agents, leveraging thought-action-observation and interprocedural context, perform better than LLMs in distinguishing vulnerable from benign code. While prompting strategies like Chain-of-Thought help LLMs, ReAct Agents require further refinement. Both methods show inconsistencies, either misidentifying vulnerabilities or over-analyzing security guards, indicating significant room for improvement.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cauchy-Schwarz Regularizers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01639v3)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a novel class of regularization functions, called Cauchy-Schwarz (CS) regularizers, which can be designed to induce a wide range of properties in solution vectors of optimization problems. To demonstrate the versatility of CS regularizers, we derive regularization functions that promote discrete-valued vectors, eigenvectors of a given matrix, and orthogonal matrices. The resulting CS regularizers are simple, differentiable, and can be free of spurious stationary points, making them suitable for gradient-based solvers and large-scale optimization problems. In addition, CS regularizers automatically adapt to the appropriate scale, which is, for example, beneficial when discretizing the weights of neural networks. To demonstrate the efficacy of CS regularizers, we provide results for solving underdetermined systems of linear equations and weight quantization in neural networks. Furthermore, we discuss specializations, variations, and generalizations, which lead to an even broader class of new and possibly more powerful regularizers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025</p></details> |

We introduce TxAgent, an AI agent that leverages multi-step reasoning and real-time biomedical knowledge retrieval across a toolbox of 211 tools to analyze drug interactions, contraindications, and patient-specific treatment strategies. TxAgent evaluates how drugs interact at molecular, pharmacokinetic, and clinical levels, identifies contraindications based on patient comorbidities and concurrent medications, and tailors treatment strategies to individual patient characteristics. It retrieves and synthesizes evidence from multiple biomedical sources, assesses interactions between drugs and patient conditions, and refines treatment recommendations through iterative reasoning. It selects tools based on task objectives and executes structured function calls to solve therapeutic tasks that require clinical reasoning and cross-source validation. The ToolUniverse consolidates 211 tools from trusted sources, including all US FDA-approved drugs since 1939 and validated clinical insights from Open Targets. TxAgent outperforms leading LLMs, tool-use models, and reasoning agents across five new benchmarks: DrugPC, BrandPC, GenericPC, TreatmentPC, and DescriptionPC, covering 3,168 drug reasoning tasks and 456 personalized treatment scenarios. It achieves 92.1% accuracy in open-ended drug reasoning tasks, surpassing GPT-4o and outperforming DeepSeek-R1 (671B) in structured multi-step reasoning. TxAgent generalizes across drug name variants and descriptions. By integrating multi-step inference, real-time knowledge grounding, and tool-assisted decision-making, TxAgent ensures that treatment recommendations align with established clinical guidelines and real-world evidence, reducing the risk of adverse events and improving therapeutic decision-making.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://zitniklab.hms.harvard.edu/TxAgent TxAgent code: https://github.com/mims-harvard/TxAgent ToolUniverse code: https://github.com/mims-harvard/ToolUniverse</p></details> |
| **[Graph-Grounded LLMs: Leveraging Graphical Function Calling to Minimize LLM Hallucinations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10941v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) is rapidly expanding across various tasks that involve inherent graphical structures. Graphs are integral to a wide range of applications, including motion planning for autonomous vehicles, social networks, scene understanding, and knowledge graphs. Many problems, even those not initially perceived as graph-based, can be effectively addressed through graph theory. However, when applied to these tasks, LLMs often encounter challenges, such as hallucinations and mathematical inaccuracies. To overcome these limitations, we propose Graph-Grounded LLMs, a system that improves LLM performance on graph-related tasks by integrating a graph library through function calls. By grounding LLMs in this manner, we demonstrate significant reductions in hallucinations and improved mathematical accuracy in solving graph-based problems, as evidenced by the performance on the NLGraph benchmark. Finally, we showcase a disaster rescue application where the Graph-Grounded LLM acts as a decision-support system.</p></details> |  |
| **[LightPlanner: Unleashing the Reasoning Capabilities of Lightweight Large Language Models in Task Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08508v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, lightweight large language models (LLMs) have garnered significant attention in the robotics field due to their low computational resource requirements and suitability for edge deployment. However, in task planning -- particularly for complex tasks that involve dynamic semantic logic reasoning -- lightweight LLMs have underperformed. To address this limitation, we propose a novel task planner, LightPlanner, which enhances the performance of lightweight LLMs in complex task planning by fully leveraging their reasoning capabilities. Unlike conventional planners that use fixed skill templates, LightPlanner controls robot actions via parameterized function calls, dynamically generating parameter values. This approach allows for fine-grained skill control and improves task planning success rates in complex scenarios. Furthermore, we introduce hierarchical deep reasoning. Before generating each action decision step, LightPlanner thoroughly considers three levels: action execution (feedback verification), semantic parsing (goal consistency verification), and parameter generation (parameter validity verification). This ensures the correctness of subsequent action controls. Additionally, we incorporate a memory module to store historical actions, thereby reducing context length and enhancing planning efficiency for long-term tasks. We train the LightPlanner-1.5B model on our LightPlan-40k dataset, which comprises 40,000 action controls across tasks with 2 to 13 action steps. Experiments demonstrate that our model achieves the highest task success rate despite having the smallest number of parameters. In tasks involving spatial semantic reasoning, the success rate exceeds that of ReAct by 14.9 percent. Moreover, we demonstrate LightPlanner's potential to operate on edge devices.</p></details> |  |
| **[RefactorBench: Evaluating Stateful Reasoning in Language Agents Through Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07832v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in language model (LM) agents and function calling have enabled autonomous, feedback-driven systems to solve problems across various digital domains. To better understand the unique limitations of LM agents, we introduce RefactorBench, a benchmark consisting of 100 large handcrafted multi-file refactoring tasks in popular open-source repositories. Solving tasks within RefactorBench requires thorough exploration of dependencies across multiple files and strong adherence to relevant instructions. Every task is defined by 3 natural language instructions of varying specificity and is mutually exclusive, allowing for the creation of longer combined tasks on the same repository. Baselines on RefactorBench reveal that current LM agents struggle with simple compositional tasks, solving only 22% of tasks with base instructions, in contrast to a human developer with short time constraints solving 87%. Through trajectory analysis, we identify various unique failure modes of LM agents, and further explore the failure mode of tracking past actions. By adapting a baseline agent to condition on representations of state, we achieve a 43.9% improvement in solving RefactorBench tasks. We further extend our state-aware approach to encompass entire digital environments and outline potential directions for future research. RefactorBench aims to support the study of LM agents by providing a set of real-world, multi-hop tasks within the realm of code.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025 Camera Ready</p></details> |

However, their performance may be limited in complex, multi-turn interactions involving users and multiple tools. To address this, we propose Magnet, a principled framework for synthesizing high-quality training trajectories to enhance the function calling capability of large language model agents in multi-turn conversations with humans. The framework is based on automatic and iterative translations from a function signature path to a sequence of queries and executable function calls. We model the complicated function interactions in multi-turn cases with graph and design novel node operations to build reliable signature paths. Motivated by context distillation, when guiding the generation of positive and negative trajectories using a teacher model, we provide reference function call sequences as positive hints in context and contrastive, incorrect function calls as negative hints. Experiments show that training with the positive trajectories with supervised fine-tuning and preference optimization against negative trajectories, our 14B model, Magnet-14B-mDPO, obtains 68.01 on BFCL-v3 and 73.30 on ToolQuery, surpassing the performance of the teacher model Gemini-1.5-pro-002 by a large margin in function calling.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 3 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

Our framework addresses a critical gap in the web agent ecosystem with a production-ready solution that combines minimal serverless backend configuration, intuitive user and browser interfaces, and extensible research capabilities in agent planning, memory, and tree search. For the core LiteWebAgent agent framework, we implemented a simple yet effective baseline using recursive function calling, providing with decoupled action generation and action grounding. In addition, we integrate advanced research components such as agent planning, agent workflow memory, and tree search in a modular and extensible manner. We then integrate the LiteWebAgent agent framework with frontend and backend as deployed systems in two formats: (1) a production Vercel-based web application, which provides users with an agent-controlled remote browser, (2) a Chrome extension leveraging LiteWebAgent's API to control an existing Chrome browser via CDP (Chrome DevTools Protocol). The LiteWebAgent framework is available at https://github.com/PathOnAI/LiteWebAgent, with deployed frontend at https://lite-web-agent.vercel.app/.</p></details> |  |
| **[CoCoNUT: Structural Code Understanding does not fall out of a tree](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16456v3)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance across a wide array of tasks involving both structured and unstructured textual data. Recent results on various benchmarks for code generation, repair, or completion suggest that certain models have programming abilities comparable to or even surpass humans. In this work, we demonstrate that high performance on such benchmarks does not correlate to humans' innate ability to understand structural control flow in code. To this end, we extract solutions from the HumanEval benchmark, which the relevant models perform strongly on, and trace their execution path using function calls sampled from the respective test set. Using this dataset, we investigate the ability of seven state-of-the-art LLMs to match the execution trace and find that, despite their ability to generate semantically identical code, they possess limited ability to trace execution paths, especially for longer traces and specific control structures. We find that even the top-performing model, Gemini, can fully and correctly generate only 47% of HumanEval task traces. Additionally, we introduce a subset for three key structures not contained in HumanEval: Recursion, Parallel Processing, and Object-Oriented Programming, including concepts like Inheritance and Polymorphism. Besides OOP, we show that none of the investigated models achieve an accuracy over 5% on the relevant traces. Aggregating these specialized parts with HumanEval tasks, we present CoCoNUT: Code Control Flow for Navigation Understanding and Testing, which measures a model's ability to trace execution of code upon relevant calls, including advanced structural components. We conclude that current LLMs need significant improvement to enhance code reasoning abilities. We hope our dataset helps researchers bridge this gap.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 2025 IEEE/ACM International Workshop on Large Language Models for Code (LLM4Code)</p></details> |

Programmers are required by regulations or application stores to provide privacy notices and labels describing these privacy behaviors. Although many tools and research prototypes have been developed to help programmers generate these notices by analyzing the source code, these approaches are often fairly coarse-grained (i.e., at the level of whole methods or files, rather than at the statement level). But this is not necessarily how privacy behaviors exist in code. Privacy behaviors are embedded in specific statements in code. Current literature does not examine what statements programmers see as most important, how consistent these views are, or how to detect them. In this paper, we conduct an empirical study to examine which statements programmers view as most-related to privacy behaviors. We find that expression statements that make function calls are most associated with privacy behaviors, while the type of privacy label has little effect on the attributes of the selected statements. We then propose an approach to automatically detect these privacy-relevant statements by fine-tuning three large language models with the data from the study. We observe that the agreement between our approach and participants is comparable to or higher than an agreement between two participants. Our study and detection approach can help programmers understand which statements in code affect privacy in mobile applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 8 figures, under review</p></details> |

Existing approaches rely on expensive human annotation, making them unsustainable at scale. We propose AgentTrek, a scalable data synthesis pipeline that generates web agent trajectories by leveraging publicly available tutorials. Our three-stage method: (1) automatically harvests and filters tutorial-like texts from the internet using a specialized classification model, (2) transforms these texts into structured task specifications with step-by-step instructions, and (3) employs a visual-language model (VLM) agent to execute these instructions in real environments, while a VLM-based evaluator verifies trajectory correctness. The synthesized trajectories encompass multiple modalities, including text-based HTML observations with function-calling API actions, and vision-based screenshot observations with pixel-level actions. This multimodal data, enriched with chain-of-thought reasoning, enables agents to achieve state-of-the-art performance on both textual web browsing benchmarks (e.g., WebArena) and visual web grounding and browsing benchmarks (e.g., ScreenSpot Web and Multimodal Mind2Web). Furthermore, our fully automated approach significantly reduces data collection costs, achieving a cost of just $0.55 per high-quality trajectory without human annotators. Our work demonstrates that guided replay using web tutorials is a practical and scalable strategy for training advanced GUI agents, paving the way for more capable and autonomous digital assistants.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR2...</summary><p>ICLR2025 Spotlight https://agenttrek.github.io</p></details> |
| **[Facilitating Multi-turn Function Calling for LLMs via Compositional Instruction Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12952v2)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited significant potential in performing diverse tasks, including the ability to call functions or use external tools to enhance their performance. While current research on function calling by LLMs primarily focuses on single-turn interactions, this paper addresses the overlooked necessity for LLMs to engage in multi-turn function calling--critical for handling compositional, real-world queries that require planning with functions but not only use functions. To facilitate this, we introduce an approach, BUTTON, which generates synthetic compositional instruction tuning data via bottom-up instruction construction and top-down trajectory generation. In the bottom-up phase, we generate simple atomic tasks based on real-world scenarios and build compositional tasks using heuristic strategies based on atomic tasks. Corresponding function definitions are then synthesized for these compositional tasks. The top-down phase features a multi-agent environment where interactions among simulated humans, assistants, and tools are utilized to gather multi-turn function calling trajectories. This approach ensures task compositionality and allows for effective function and trajectory generation by examining atomic tasks within compositional tasks. We produce a dataset BUTTONInstruct comprising 8k data points and demonstrate its effectiveness through extensive experiments across various LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Data Unlearning in Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01034v1)** | 2025-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent work has shown that diffusion models memorize and reproduce training data examples. At the same time, large copyright lawsuits and legislation such as GDPR have highlighted the need for erasing datapoints from diffusion models. However, retraining from scratch is often too expensive. This motivates the setting of data unlearning, i.e., the study of efficient techniques for unlearning specific datapoints from the training set. Existing concept unlearning techniques require an anchor prompt/class/distribution to guide unlearning, which is not available in the data unlearning setting. General-purpose machine unlearning techniques were found to be either unstable or failed to unlearn data. We therefore propose a family of new loss functions called Subtracted Importance Sampled Scores (SISS) that utilize importance sampling and are the first method to unlearn data with theoretical guarantees. SISS is constructed as a weighted combination between simpler objectives that are responsible for preserving model quality and unlearning the targeted datapoints. When evaluated on CelebA-HQ and MNIST, SISS achieved Pareto optimality along the quality and unlearning strength dimensions. On Stable Diffusion, SISS successfully mitigated memorization on nearly 90% of the prompts we tested.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

The computational cost of Kanana is significantly lower than that of state-of-the-art models of similar size.

| **[Offline Reinforcement Learning via Inverse Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20030v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inspired by the recent successes of Inverse Optimization (IO) across various application domains, we propose a novel offline Reinforcement Learning (ORL) algorithm for continuous state and action spaces, leveraging the convex loss function called ``sub-optimality loss" from the IO literature. To mitigate the distribution shift commonly observed in ORL problems, we further employ a robust and non-causal Model Predictive Control (MPC) expert steering a nominal model of the dynamics using in-hindsight information stemming from the model mismatch. Unlike the existing literature, our robust MPC expert enjoys an exact and tractable convex reformulation. In the second part of this study, we show that the IO hypothesis class, trained by the proposed convex loss function, enjoys ample expressiveness and achieves competitive performance comparing with the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in the low-data regime of the MuJoCo benchmark while utilizing three orders of magnitude fewer parameters, thereby requiring significantly fewer computational resources. To facilitate the reproducibility of our results, we provide an open-source package implementing the proposed algorithms and the experiments.</p></details> | preprint |
| **[I Know What I Don't Know: Improving Model Cascades Through Confidence Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19335v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale machine learning models deliver strong performance across a wide range of tasks but come with significant computational and resource constraints. To mitigate these challenges, local smaller models are often deployed alongside larger models, relying on routing and deferral mechanisms to offload complex tasks. However, existing approaches inadequately balance the capabilities of these models, often resulting in unnecessary deferrals or sub-optimal resource usage. In this work we introduce a novel loss function called Gatekeeper for calibrating smaller models in cascade setups. Our approach fine-tunes the smaller model to confidently handle tasks it can perform correctly while deferring complex tasks to the larger model. Moreover, it incorporates a mechanism for managing the trade-off between model performance and deferral accuracy, and is broadly applicable across various tasks and domains without any architectural changes. We evaluate our method on encoder-only, decoder-only, and encoder-decoder architectures. Experiments across image classification, language modeling, and vision-language tasks show that our approach substantially improves deferral performance.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing approaches focus on mainstream languages such as Python and Java, neglecting the Solidity language, the predominant programming language for Ethereum smart contracts. Due to the lack of adequate benchmarks for Solidity, LLMs' ability to generate secure, cost-effective smart contracts remains unexplored. To fill this gap, we construct SolEval, the first repository-level benchmark designed for Solidity smart contract generation, to evaluate the performance of LLMs on Solidity. SolEval consists of 1,125 samples from 9 different repositories, covering 6 popular domains, providing LLMs with a comprehensive evaluation benchmark. Unlike the existing Solidity benchmark, SolEval not only includes complex function calls but also reflects the real-world complexity of the Ethereum ecosystem by incorporating gas fee and vulnerability rate. We evaluate 10 LLMs on SolEval, and our results show that the best-performing LLM achieves only 26.29% Pass@10, highlighting substantial room for improvement in Solidity code generation by LLMs. We release our data and code at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/SolEval-1C06/.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Simple Introduction to the SiMPL Method for Density-Based Topology Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19421v3)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a novel method for solving density-based topology optimization problems: Sigmoidal Mirror descent with a Projected Latent variable (SiMPL). The SiMPL method (pronounced as ``the simple method'') optimizes a design using only first-order derivative information of the objective function. The bound constraints on the density field are enforced with the help of the (negative) Fermi--Dirac entropy, which is also used to define a non-symmetric distance function called a Bregman divergence on the set of admissible designs. This Bregman divergence leads to a simple update rule that is further simplified with the help of a so-called latent variable. Because the SiMPL method involves discretizing the latent variable, it produces a sequence of pointwise-feasible iterates, even when high-order finite elements are used in the discretization. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the method outperforms other popular first-order optimization algorithms. To outline the general applicability of the technique, we include examples with (self-load) compliance minimization and compliant mechanism optimization problems.</p></details> |  |

CoALM: A Unified Conversational Agentic Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08820v3)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) with API-calling capabilities enabled building effective Language Agents (LA), while also revolutionizing the conventional task-oriented dialogue (TOD) paradigm. However, current approaches face a critical dilemma: TOD systems are often trained on a limited set of target APIs, requiring new data to maintain their quality when interfacing with new services, while LAs are not trained to maintain user intent over multi-turn conversations. Because both robust multi-turn management and advanced function calling are crucial for effective conversational agents, we evaluate these skills on three popular benchmarks: MultiWOZ 2.4 (TOD), BFCL V3 (LA), and API-Bank (LA), and our analyses reveal that specialized approaches excel in one domain but underperform in the other. To bridge this chasm, we introduce CoALM (Conversational Agentic Language Model), a unified approach that integrates both conversational and agentic capabilities. We created CoALM-IT, a carefully constructed multi-task dataset that interleave multi-turn ReAct reasoning with complex API usage. Using CoALM-IT, we train three models CoALM 8B, CoALM 70B, and CoALM 405B, which outperform top domain-specific models, including GPT-4o, across all three benchmarks. This demonstrates the feasibility of a single model approach for both TOD and LA, setting a new standard for conversational agents.</p></details> |  |

Detecting and identifying families as early as possible provides an edge in protecting against such malware. We explore a lightweight, order-invariant approach to detecting and mitigating malware threats: analyzing API calls without regard to their sequence. We publish a public dataset of over three hundred thousand samples and their function call parameters for this task, annotated with labels indicating benign or malicious activity. The complete dataset is above 550GB uncompressed in size. We leverage machine learning algorithms, such as random forests, and conduct behavioral analysis by examining patterns and anomalies in API call sequences. By investigating how the function calls occur regardless of their order, we can identify discriminating features that can help us identify malware early on. The models we've developed are not only effective but also efficient. They are lightweight and can run on any machine with minimal performance overhead, while still achieving an impressive F1-Score of over 85\%. We also empirically show that we only need a subset of the function call sequence, specifically calls to the ntdll.dll library, to identify malware. Our research demonstrates the efficacy of this approach through empirical evaluations, underscoring its accuracy and scalability. The code is open source and available at Github along with the dataset on Zenodo.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we develop a novel method to assess LLMs in solving CTF challenges by creating a scalable, open-source benchmark database specifically designed for these applications. This database includes metadata for LLM testing and adaptive learning, compiling a diverse range of CTF challenges from popular competitions. Utilizing the advanced function calling capabilities of LLMs, we build a fully automated system with an enhanced workflow and support for external tool calls.

| **[FlexFL: Flexible and Effective Fault Localization with Open-Source Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10714v2)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the impressive code comprehension ability of Large Language Models (LLMs), a few studies have proposed to leverage LLMs to locate bugs, i.e., LLM-based FL, and demonstrated promising performance. However, first, these methods are limited in flexibility. They rely on bug-triggering test cases to perform FL and cannot make use of other available bug-related information, e.g., bug reports. Second, they are built upon proprietary LLMs, which are, although powerful, confronted with risks in data privacy. To address these limitations, we propose a novel LLM-based FL framework named FlexFL, which can flexibly leverage different types of bug-related information and effectively work with open-source LLMs. FlexFL is composed of two stages. In the first stage, FlexFL reduces the search space of buggy code using state-of-the-art FL techniques of different families and provides a candidate list of bug-related methods. In the second stage, FlexFL leverages LLMs to delve deeper to double-check the code snippets of methods suggested by the first stage and refine fault localization results. In each stage, FlexFL constructs agents based on open-source LLMs, which share the same pipeline that does not postulate any type of bug-related information and can interact with function calls without the out-of-the-box capability. Extensive experimental results on Defects4J demonstrate that FlexFL outperforms the baselines and can work with different open-source LLMs. Specifically, FlexFL with a lightweight open-source LLM Llama3-8B can locate 42 and 63 more bugs than two state-of-the-art LLM-based FL approaches AutoFL and AgentFL that both use GPT-3.5.</p></details> | 17 pages, 4 figures |

This task supports various reverse engineering applications, such as vulnerability identification, malware analysis, and legacy software migration. The end-to-end decompile method based on large langauge models (LLMs) reduces reliance on additional tools and minimizes manual intervention due to its inherent properties. However, previous end-to-end methods often lose critical information necessary for reconstructing control flow structures and variables when processing binary files, making it challenging to accurately recover the program's logic. To address these issues, we propose the \textbf{ReF Decompile} method, which incorporates the following innovations: (1) The Relabelling strategy replaces jump target addresses with labels, preserving control flow clarity. (2) The Function Call strategy infers variable types and retrieves missing variable information from binary files. Experimental results on the Humaneval-Decompile Benchmark demonstrate that ReF Decompile surpasses comparable baselines and achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance of $61.43\%$.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce HammerBench, a novel benchmark framework for assessing LLMs' function-calling capabilities in real-world, multi-turn dialogues. HammerBench simulates diverse mobile assistant use cases, incorporating imperfect instructions, dynamic question-answer trajectories, intent and argument shifts, and the indirect use of external information through pronouns. To construct this benchmark, we curate a comprehensive dataset derived from popular mobile app functionalities and anonymized user logs, complemented by a cost-effective data generation pipeline leveraging open-source models. HammerBench is further augmented with fine-grained interaction snapshots and metrics, enabling detailed evaluation of function-calling performance across individual conversational turns. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HammerBench by evaluating several leading LLMs and uncovering key performance trends. Our experiments reveal that different types of parameter name errors are a significant source of failure across different interaction scenarios, highlighting critical areas for further improvement in LLM robustness for mobile assistant applications.</p></details> |  |

Integrating AI agents into CRM systems can automate routine processes and enhance personalized service. However, deploying and evaluating these agents is challenging due to the lack of realistic benchmarks that reflect the complexity of real-world CRM tasks. To address this issue, we introduce CRMArena, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate AI agents on realistic tasks grounded in professional work environments. Following guidance from CRM experts and industry best practices, we designed CRMArena with nine customer service tasks distributed across three personas: service agent, analyst, and manager. The benchmark includes 16 commonly used industrial objects (e.g., account, order, knowledge article, case) with high interconnectivity, along with latent variables (e.g., complaint habits, policy violations) to simulate realistic data distributions. Experimental results reveal that state-of-the-art LLM agents succeed in less than 40% of the tasks with ReAct prompting, and less than 55% even with function-calling abilities. Our findings highlight the need for enhanced agent capabilities in function-calling and rule-following to be deployed in real-world work environments. CRMArena is an open challenge to the community: systems that can reliably complete tasks showcase direct business value in a popular work environment.</p></details> | NAACL 2025 |
| **[HawkEye: Statically and Accurately Profiling the Communication Cost of Models in Multi-party Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11029v1)** | 2025-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-party computation (MPC) based machine learning, referred to as multi-party learning (MPL), has become an important technology for utilizing data from multiple parties with privacy preservation. In recent years, in order to apply MPL in more practical scenarios, various MPC-friendly models have been proposedto reduce the extraordinary communication overhead of MPL. Within the optimization of MPC-friendly models, a critical element to tackle the challenge is profiling the communication cost of models. However, the current solutions mainly depend on manually establishing the profiles to identify communication bottlenecks of models, often involving burdensome human efforts in a monotonous procedure. In this paper, we propose HawkEye, a static model communication cost profiling framework, which enables model designers to get the accurate communication cost of models in MPL frameworks without dynamically running the secure model training or inference processes on a specific MPL framework. Firstly, to profile the communication cost of models with complex structures, we propose a static communication cost profiling method based on a prefix structure that records the function calling chain during the static analysis. Secondly, HawkEye employs an automatic differentiation library to assist model designers in profiling the communication cost of models in PyTorch. Finally, we compare the static profiling results of HawkEye against the profiling results obtained through dynamically running secure model training and inference processes on five popular MPL frameworks, CryptFlow2, CrypTen, Delphi, Cheetah, and SecretFlow-SEMI2K. The experimental results show that HawkEye can accurately profile the model communication cost without dynamic profiling.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for publication at USENIX Security 2025.

| **[Combining Evidence Across Filtrations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09698v3)** | 2025-02-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In sequential anytime-valid inference, any admissible procedure must be based on e-processes: generalizations of test martingales that quantify the accumulated evidence against a composite null hypothesis at any stopping time. This paper proposes a method for combining e-processes constructed in different filtrations but for the same null. Although e-processes in the same filtration can be combined effortlessly (by averaging), e-processes in different filtrations cannot because their validity in a coarser filtration does not translate to a finer filtration. This issue arises in sequential tests of randomness and independence, as well as in the evaluation of sequential forecasters. We establish that a class of functions called adjusters can lift arbitrary e-processes across filtrations. The result yields a generally applicable "adjust-then-combine" procedure, which we demonstrate on the problem of testing randomness in real-world financial data. Furthermore, we prove a characterization theorem for adjusters that formalizes a sense in which using adjusters is necessary. There are two major implications. First, if we have a powerful e-process in a coarsened filtration, then we readily have a powerful e-process in the original filtration. Second, when we coarsen the filtration to construct an e-process, there is a logarithmic cost to recovering validity in the original filtration.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review.

However, existing environments are often domain-specific and require complex setups, which limits agent development and evaluation in real-world settings. As a result, current evaluations lack in-depth analyses that decompose fundamental agent capabilities. We introduce AgentStudio, a trinity of environments, tools, and benchmarks to address these issues. AgentStudio provides a lightweight, interactive environment with highly generic observation and action spaces, e.g., video observations and GUI/API actions. It integrates tools for creating online benchmark tasks, annotating GUI elements, and labeling actions in videos. Based on our environment and tools, we curate an online task suite that benchmarks both GUI interactions and function calling with efficient auto-evaluation. We also reorganize existing datasets and collect new ones using our tools to establish three datasets: GroundUI, IDMBench, and CriticBench. These datasets evaluate fundamental agent abilities, including GUI grounding, learning from videos, and success detection, pointing to the desiderata for robust, general, and open-ended virtual agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025.

| **[The Danger of Overthinking: Examining the Reasoning-Action Dilemma in Agentic Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08235v1)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) represent a breakthrough in AI problem-solving capabilities, but their effectiveness in interactive environments can be limited. This paper introduces and analyzes overthinking in LRMs. A phenomenon where models favor extended internal reasoning chains over environmental interaction. Through experiments on software engineering tasks using SWE Bench Verified, we observe three recurring patterns: Analysis Paralysis, Rogue Actions, and Premature Disengagement. We propose a framework to study these behaviors, which correlates with human expert assessments, and analyze 4018 trajectories. We observe that higher overthinking scores correlate with decreased performance, with reasoning models exhibiting stronger tendencies toward overthinking compared to non-reasoning models. Our analysis reveals that simple efforts to mitigate overthinking in agentic environments, such as selecting the solution with the lower overthinking score, can improve model performance by almost 30% while reducing computational costs by 43%. These results suggest that mitigating overthinking has strong practical implications. We suggest that by leveraging native function-calling capabilities and selective reinforcement learning overthinking tendencies could be mitigated. We also open-source our evaluation framework and dataset to facilitate research in this direction at https://github.com/AlexCuadron/Overthinking.</p></details> |  |
| **[SCOPE: Performance Testing for Serverless Computing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01620v2)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Serverless computing is a popular cloud computing paradigm that has found widespread adoption across various online workloads. It allows software engineers to develop cloud applications as a set of functions (called serverless functions). However, accurately measuring the performance (i.e., end-to-end response latency) of serverless functions is challenging due to the highly dynamic nature of the environment in which they run. To tackle this problem, a potential solution is to apply checks of performance testing techniques to determine how many repetitions of a given serverless function across a range of inputs are needed to cater to the performance fluctuation. However, the available literature lacks performance testing approaches designed explicitly for serverless computing. In this paper, we propose SCOPE, the first serverless computing-oriented performance testing approach. SCOPE takes into account the unique performance characteristics of serverless functions, such as their short execution durations and on-demand triggering. As such, SCOPE is designed as a fine-grained analysis approach. SCOPE incorporates the accuracy check and the consistency check to obtain the accurate and reliable performance of serverless functions. The evaluation shows that SCOPE provides testing results with 97.25% accuracy, 33.83 percentage points higher than the best currently available technique. Moreover, the superiority of SCOPE over the state-of-the-art holds on all functions that we study.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology (TOSEM)</p></details> |

Building upon the Llama 3.2 model family, we continue the pre-training of Breeze2 on an extensive corpus to enhance the linguistic and cultural heritage of Traditional Chinese. In addition to language modeling capabilities, we significantly augment the models with function calling and vision understanding capabilities. At the time of this publication, as far as we are aware, absent reasoning-inducing prompts, Breeze2 are the strongest performing models in Traditional Chinese function calling and image understanding in its size class. The effectiveness of Breeze2 is benchmarked across various tasks, including Taiwan general knowledge, instruction-following, long context, function calling, and vision understanding. We are publicly releasing all Breeze2 models under the Llama 3.2 Community License. We also showcase the capabilities of the model running on mobile platform with a mobile application which we also open source.</p></details> |  |

We introduce Hephaestus-Forge, the first large-scale pre-training corpus designed to enhance the fundamental capabilities of LLM agents in API function calling, intrinsic reasoning and planning, and adapting to environmental feedback. Hephaestus-Forge comprises 103B agent-specific data encompassing 76,537 APIs, including both tool documentation to introduce knowledge of API functions and function calling trajectories to strengthen intrinsic reasoning. To explore effective training protocols, we investigate scaling laws to identify the optimal recipe in data mixing ratios. By continual pre-training on Hephaestus-Forge, Hephaestus outperforms small- to medium-scale open-source LLMs and rivals commercial LLMs on three agent benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our pre-training corpus in enhancing fundamental agentic capabilities and generalization of LLMs to new tasks or environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NAACL 2025 main conference</p></details> |
| **[Interactive Task Planning with Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10645v2)** | 2025-02-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An interactive robot framework accomplishes long-horizon task planning and can easily generalize to new goals and distinct tasks, even during execution. However, most traditional methods require predefined module design, making it hard to generalize to different goals. Recent large language model based approaches can allow for more open-ended planning but often require heavy prompt engineering or domain specific pretrained models. To tackle this, we propose a simple framework that achieves interactive task planning with language models by incorporating both high-level planning and low-level skill execution through function calling, leveraging pretrained vision models to ground the scene in language. We verify the robustness of our system on the real world task of making milk tea drinks. Our system is able to generate novel high-level instructions for unseen objectives and successfully accomplishes user tasks. Furthermore, when the user sends a new request, our system is able to replan accordingly with precision based on the new request, task guidelines and previously executed steps. Our approach is easy to adapt to different tasks by simply substituting the task guidelines, without the need for additional complex prompt engineering.

| **[Optimal Neural Network Approximation for High-Dimensional Continuous Functions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02363v3)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, the authors of Shen Yang Zhang (JMLR, 2022) developed a neural network with width $36d(2d + 1)$ and depth $11$, which utilizes a special activation function called the elementary universal activation function, to achieve the super approximation property for functions in $C([a,b]^d)$. That is, the constructed network only requires a fixed number of neurons (and thus parameters) to approximate a $d$-variate continuous function on a $d$-dimensional hypercube with arbitrary accuracy. More specifically, only $\mathcal{O}(d^2)$ neurons or parameters are used. One natural question is whether we can reduce the number of these neurons or parameters in such a network. By leveraging a variant of the Kolmogorov Superposition Theorem, our analysis shows that there is a neural network generated by the elementary universal activation function with at most $10889d+10887$ unique nonzero parameters such that this super approximation property is attained. Furthermore, we present a family of continuous functions that requires at least width $d$, and thus at least $d$ neurons or parameters, to achieve arbitrary accuracy in its approximation. This suggests that the number of unique nonzero parameters is optimal in the sense that it grows linearly with the input dimension $d$, unlike some approximation methods where parameters may grow exponentially with $d$.</p></details> |  |
| **[Following Devils' Footprint: Towards Real-time Detection of Price Manipulation Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03718v1)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Price manipulation attack is one of the notorious threats in decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, which allows attackers to exchange tokens at an extensively deviated price from the market. Existing efforts usually rely on reactive methods to identify such kind of attacks after they have happened, e.g., detecting attack transactions in the post-attack stage, which cannot mitigate or prevent price manipulation attacks timely. From the perspective of attackers, they usually need to deploy attack contracts in the pre-attack stage. Thus, if we can identify these attack contracts in a proactive manner, we can raise alarms and mitigate the threats. With the core idea in mind, in this work, we shift our attention from the victims to the attackers. Specifically, we propose SMARTCAT, a novel approach for identifying price manipulation attacks in the pre-attack stage proactively. For generality, it conducts analysis on bytecode and does not require any source code and transaction data. For accuracy, it depicts the control- and data-flow dependency relationships among function calls into a token flow graph. For scalability, it filters out those suspicious paths, in which it conducts inter-contract analysis as necessary. To this end, SMARTCAT can pinpoint attacks in real time once they have been deployed on a chain. The evaluation results illustrate that SMARTCAT significantly outperforms existing baselines with 91.6% recall and ~100% precision. Moreover, SMARTCAT also uncovers 616 attack contracts in-the-wild, accounting for \$9.25M financial losses, with only 19 cases publicly reported. By applying SMARTCAT as a real-time detector in Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain, it has raised 14 alarms 99 seconds after the corresponding deployment on average. These attacks have already led to $641K financial losses, and seven of them are still waiting for their ripe time.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear on the Usenix Security 2025</p></details> |
| **[Approximating Competitive Equilibrium by Nash Welfare](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09994v2)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We explore the relationship between two popular concepts in the allocation of divisible items: competitive equilibrium (CE) and allocations with maximum Nash welfare, i.e., allocations where the weighted geometric mean of the utilities is maximal. When agents have homogeneous concave utility functions, these two concepts coincide: the classical Eisenberg-Gale convex program that maximizes Nash welfare over feasible allocations yields a competitive equilibrium. However, these two concepts diverge for non-homogeneous utilities. From a computational perspective, maximizing Nash welfare amounts to solving a convex program for any concave utility functions, computing CE becomes PPAD-hard already for separable piecewise linear concave (SPLC) utilities. We introduce the concept of Gale-substitute utility functions, which is an analogue of the weak gross substitutes (WGS) property for the so-called Gale demand system. For Gale-substitutes utilities, we show that any allocation maximizing Nash welfare provides an approximate-CE with surprisingly strong guarantees, where every agent gets at least half the maximum utility they can get at any CE, and is approximately envy-free. Gale-substitutes include utility functions where computing CE is PPAD hard, such as all separable concave utilities and the previously studied non-separable class of Leontief-free utilities. We introduce a broad new class of utility functions called generalized network utilities based on the generalized flow model. This class includes SPLC and Leontief-free utilities, and we show that all such utilities are Gale-substitutes. Conversely, although some agents may get much higher utility at a Nash welfare maximizing allocation than at a CE, we show a price of anarchy type result: for general concave utilities, every CE achieves at least $(1/e)^{1/e} > 0.69$ fraction of the maximum Nash welfare, and this factor is tight.</p></details> |  |

While LLMs have been effective for code generation, recent work has shown that PBE is challenging but improvable by fine-tuning, especially with training data drawn from the same distribution as evaluation data. In this paper, we create a conceptual framework of what constitutes a "similar distribution" for SLI and propose four kinds of synthetic data generation methods with varying amounts of inductive bias to investigate what leads to the best performance. Based on the results we create a SOTA open-source model for SLI as PBE (+6% pass rate with a third of the parameters of the second-best LLM) and also highlight exciting future directions for PBE research.</p></details> |  |

Experiment results show that LUCY is better at emotion control than peer models, generating emotional responses based on linguistic emotional instructions and responding to paralinguistic emotional cues.

We analyze the mathematical properties of both real-valued and complex-valued Lehmer activation units and demonstrate their applications in modeling nonlinear interactions. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our proposed neural network achieves competitive accuracy on benchmark datasets with significantly improved computational efficiency. A single layer of real-valued or complex-valued Lehmer activation units is shown to deliver state-of-the-art performance, balancing efficiency with interpretability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Querying Databases with Function Calling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00032v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly accelerating largely thanks to their integration with external tools. Querying databases is among the most effective of these integrations, enabling LLMs to access private or continually updating data. While Function Calling is the most common method for interfacing external tools to LLMs, its application to database querying as a tool has been underexplored. We propose a tool definition for database querying that unifies accessing data with search queries, filters, or a combination both, as well as transforming results with aggregation and groupby operators. To evaluate its effectiveness, we conduct a study with 8 LLMs spanning 5 model families. We present a novel pipeline adapting the Gorilla LLM framework to create synthetic database schemas and queries. We primarily evaluate the models with the Exact Match of predicted and ground truth query APIs. Among the models tested, Claude 3.5 Sonnet achieves the highest performance with an Exact Match score of 74.3%, followed by GPT-4o mini at 73.7%, and GPT-4o at 71.8%. We further breakdown these results per API component utilized and across synthetic use cases. We find that LLMs are highly effective at utilizing operators on boolean properties, but struggle with text property filters. Across use cases we find robust results with the higher performing models such as GPT-4o, but significant performance variance across use cases from lower performing models. We additionally conduct ablation studies exploring the impact of parallel tool calling, adding a rationale as an argument of the tool call, using a separate tool per database collection, and tool calling with structured outputs. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of enabling LLMs to query databases with Function Calling.

At the core of these agents, an LLM must plan, execute, and respond using external tools, APIs, and custom functions. Research on tool calling has gathered momentum, but evaluation benchmarks and datasets representing the complexity of the tasks have lagged behind. In this work, we focus on one such complexity, nested sequencing, with the goal of extending existing benchmarks and evaluation. Specifically, we present NESTFUL, a benchmark to evaluate LLMs on nested sequences of API calls, i.e., sequences where the output of one API call is passed as input to a subsequent call. NESTFUL contains 1800+ nested sequences where all the function calls are executable. Experimental results on multiple models and settings show that the best-performing model on the dataset has a full sequence match accuracy of 25% and win-rate of 34% necessitating a large scope for improvement in the nested sequencing aspect of function calling. Our analysis of these results provides possible future research directions for the community, in addition to a benchmark to track progress. We have released the NESTFUL dataset under the Apache 2.0 license at https://github.com/IBM/NESTFUL.</p></details> |  |

The Array Canary appears to be an advanced form of the array shuffling techniques employed by the Emotet JavaScript downloader. In practice, a series of Array Canaries are set within a string array and if modified will cause the program to endlessly loop. In this paper, we demonstrate how an Array Canary works and discuss Autonomous Function Call Resolution (AFCR), which is a method we created to bypass Array Canaries. We also introduce Arphsy, a proof-of-concept for AFCR designed to guide Large Language Models and security researchers in the deobfuscation of "canaried" JavaScript code. We accomplish this by (i) Finding and extracting all Immediately Invoked Function Expressions from a canaried file, (ii) parsing the file's Abstract Syntax Tree for any function that does not implement imported function calls, (iii) identifying the most reassigned variable and its corresponding function body, (iv) calculating the length of the largest string array and uses it to determine the offset values within the canaried file, (v) aggregating all the previously identified functions into a single file, and (vi) appending driver code into the verified file and using it to deobfuscate the canaried file.</p></details> |  |

Mainstream methods, such as CoT/ReAct, rely on step-by-step tool invocation to interact with external environments, but they are limited in perceptual scope and lack adequate task-planning capability. To address these limitations, other studies introduce the first Search-based Decision Tree (DFSDT), which still suffers from the high computational cost. In this paper, we introduce a novel parallel tool invocation paradigm, DTA-Llama (Divide-Then-Aggregate Llama). First, we transform traditional tree-based tool search paths into Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structure, generating a high-quality parallel tool invocation dataset. The DTA-Llama is then trained on the dataset to learn to iteratively divide the current task into several parallel tool invocation sub-tasks and aggregate the invocation results to decide the next actions. Furthermore, we introduce an efficient inference framework inspired by the Process/Threads mechanism when applying the DTA-Llama to practical tasks. Experimental results show that our approach substantially enhances task performance while reducing token consumption and inference time. Llama2-7B, using our method, is comparable to the official parallel function calling method of GPT-3.5.

Current approaches to enable tool usage often rely on model-specific prompting or fine-tuning a model for function-calling instructions. Both approaches have notable limitations, including reduced adaptability to unseen tools and high resource requirements. This paper introduces FREYR, a streamlined framework that modularizes the tool usage process into separate steps. Through this decomposition, we show that FREYR achieves superior performance compared to conventional tool usage methods. We evaluate FREYR on a set of real-world test cases specific for video game design and compare it against traditional tool usage as provided by the Ollama API.</p></details> | 15 pages |

We rank the optimisers with respect to metrics such as final energy achieved and function calls needed to get within a certain tolerance level, and find that the best performing optimisers are variants of gradient descent such as Momentum and ADAM (using finite difference), SPSA, CMAES, and BayesMGD. We also perform gradient analysis and observe that the step size for finite difference has a very significant impact. We also consider using simultaneous perturbation (inspired by SPSA) as a gradient subroutine: here finite difference can lead to a more precise estimate of the ground state but uses more calls, whereas simultaneous perturbation can converge quicker but may be less precise in the later stages. Finally, we also study the quantum natural gradient algorithm: we implement this method for 1-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard systems, and find that whilst it can reach a lower energy with fewer iterations, this improvement is typically lost when taking total function calls into account. Our method involves performing careful hyperparameter sweeping on 4 instances. We present a variety of analysis and figures, detailed optimiser notes, and discuss future directions.</p></details> | <details><summary>43 pa...</summary><p>43 pages, 30 figures.

However, evaluating the function calling abilities of LLMs in real-world scenarios remains under-explored due to the complexity of data collection and evaluation. In this work, we introduce ComplexFuncBench, a benchmark for complex function calling across five real-world scenarios. Compared to existing benchmarks, ComplexFuncBench encompasses multi-step and constrained function calling, which requires long-parameter filing, parameter value reasoning, and 128k long context. Additionally, we propose an automatic framework, ComplexEval, for quantitatively evaluating complex function calling tasks. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate the deficiencies of state-of-the-art LLMs in function calling and suggest future directions for optimizing these capabilities.

| **[A General Framework for Inference-time Scaling and Steering of Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06848v3)** | 2025-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models produce impressive results in modalities ranging from images and video to protein design and text. However, generating samples with user-specified properties remains a challenge. Recent research proposes fine-tuning models to maximize rewards that capture desired properties, but these methods require expensive training and are prone to mode collapse. In this work, we propose Feynman Kac (FK) steering, an inference-time framework for steering diffusion models with reward functions. FK steering works by sampling a system of multiple interacting diffusion processes, called particles, and resampling particles at intermediate steps based on scores computed using functions called potentials. Potentials are defined using rewards for intermediate states and are selected such that a high value indicates that the particle will yield a high-reward sample. We explore various choices of potentials, intermediate rewards, and samplers. We evaluate FK steering on text-to-image and text diffusion models. For steering text-to-image models with a human preference reward, we find that FK steering a 0.8B parameter model outperforms a 2.6B parameter fine-tuned model on prompt fidelity, with faster sampling and no training. For steering text diffusion models with rewards for text quality and specific text attributes, we find that FK steering generates lower perplexity, more linguistically acceptable outputs and enables gradient-free control of attributes like toxicity. Our results demonstrate that inference-time scaling and steering of diffusion models, even with off-the-shelf rewards, can provide significant sample quality gains and controllability benefits.

| **[OptiChat: Bridging Optimization Models and Practitioners with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08406v1)** | 2025-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optimization models have been applied to solve a wide variety of decision-making problems. These models are usually developed by optimization experts but are used by practitioners without optimization expertise in various application domains. As a result, practitioners often struggle to interact with and draw useful conclusions from optimization models independently. To fill this gap, we introduce OptiChat, a natural language dialogue system designed to help practitioners interpret model formulation, diagnose infeasibility, analyze sensitivity, retrieve information, evaluate modifications, and provide counterfactual explanations. By augmenting large language models (LLMs) with functional calls and code generation tailored for optimization models, we enable seamless interaction and minimize the risk of hallucinations in OptiChat. We develop a new dataset to evaluate OptiChat's performance in explaining optimization models. Experiments demonstrate that OptiChat effectively bridges the gap between optimization models and practitioners, delivering autonomous, accurate, and instant responses.</p></details> |  |

The approach is based on an embedding of the system into a higher-dimensional feature space in which the dynamics become quadratic. Just like SINDy (Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics), our method requires trajectory data, time derivatives for the training data points, which can also be estimated using finite difference approximations, and a set of preselected basis functions, called dictionary. We illustrate the efficacy and accuracy of QENDy with the aid of various benchmark problems and compare its performance with SINDy and a deep learning method for identifying quadratic embeddings. Furthermore, we analyze the convergence of QENDy and SINDy in the infinite data limit, highlight their similarities and main differences, and compare the quadratic embedding with linearization techniques based on the Koopman operator.</p></details> |  |

API calling in chatbot systems poses significant challenges, particularly in complex, multi-step tasks requiring accurate API selection and execution. We contribute to this domain in three ways: first, by introducing a novel dataset designed to assess models on API function selection, parameter generation, and nested API calls; second, by benchmarking state-of-the-art language models across varying levels of complexity to evaluate their performance in API function generation and parameter accuracy; and third, by proposing an enhanced API routing method that combines general-purpose large language models for API selection with fine-tuned models for parameter generation and some prompt engineering approach. These approaches lead to substantial improvements in handling complex API tasks, offering practical advancements for real-world API-driven chatbot systems.</p></details> |  |

However, progress has been hindered by a lack of reliable evaluation datasets. To address this, we present ToolHop, a dataset comprising 995 user queries and 3,912 associated tools, specifically designed for rigorous evaluation of multi-hop tool use. ToolHop ensures diverse queries, meaningful interdependencies, locally executable tools, detailed feedback, and verifiable answers through a novel query-driven data construction approach that includes tool creation, document refinement, and code generation. We evaluate 14 LLMs across five model families (i.e., LLaMA3.1, Qwen2.5, Gemini1.5, Claude3.5, and GPT), uncovering significant challenges in handling multi-hop tool-use scenarios. The leading model, GPT-4o, achieves an accuracy of 49.04%, underscoring substantial room for improvement. Further analysis reveals variations in tool-use strategies for various families, offering actionable insights to guide the development of more effective approaches.

| **[Optimizing Small Language Models for In-Vehicle Function-Calling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02342v1)** | 2025-01-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a holistic approach for deploying Small Language Models (SLMs) as function-calling agents within vehicles as edge devices, offering a more flexible and robust alternative to traditional rule-based systems. By leveraging SLMs, we simplify vehicle control mechanisms and enhance the user experience. Given the in-vehicle hardware constraints, we apply state-of-the-art model compression techniques, including structured pruning, healing, and quantization, ensuring that the model fits within the resource limitations while maintaining acceptable performance. Our work focuses on optimizing a representative SLM, Microsoft's Phi-3 mini, and outlines best practices for enabling embedded models, including compression, task-specific fine-tuning, and vehicle integration. We demonstrate that, despite significant reduction in model size which removes up to 2 billion parameters from the original model, our approach preserves the model's ability to handle complex in-vehicle tasks accurately and efficiently. Furthermore, by executing the model in a lightweight runtime environment, we achieve a generation speed of 11 tokens per second, making real-time, on-device inference feasible without hardware acceleration. Our results demonstrate the potential of SLMs to transform vehicle control systems, enabling more intuitive interactions between users and their vehicles for an enhanced driving experience.</p></details> |  |
| **[SR-Reward: Taking The Path More Traveled](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02330v1)** | 2025-01-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose a novel method for learning reward functions directly from offline demonstrations. Unlike traditional inverse reinforcement learning (IRL), our approach decouples the reward function from the learner's policy, eliminating the adversarial interaction typically required between the two. This results in a more stable and efficient training process. Our reward function, called \textit{SR-Reward}, leverages successor representation (SR) to encode a state based on expected future states' visitation under the demonstration policy and transition dynamics. By utilizing the Bellman equation, SR-Reward can be learned concurrently with most reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms without altering the existing training pipeline. We also introduce a negative sampling strategy to mitigate overestimation errors by reducing rewards for out-of-distribution data, thereby enhancing robustness. This strategy inherently introduces a conservative bias into RL algorithms that employ the learned reward. We evaluate our method on the D4RL benchmark, achieving competitive results compared to offline RL algorithms with access to true rewards and imitation learning (IL) techniques like behavioral cloning. Moreover, our ablation studies on data size and quality reveal the advantages and limitations of SR-Reward as a proxy for true rewards.</p></details> |  |

To tackle these challenges, this paper introduces ADC, an innovative approach that enhances LLMs' ability to follow function formats and match complex parameters. ADC utilizes a high-quality code fine-tuning dataset with line-level execution feedback, providing granular process supervision that fosters strong logical reasoning and adherence to function formats. It also employs an adversarial dataset generation process to improve parameter matching. The staged training methodology capitalizes on both enriched code datasets and refined adversarial datasets, leading to marked improvements in function calling capabilities on the Berkeley Function-Calling Leaderboard (BFCL) Benchmark. The innovation of ADC lies in its strategic combination of process supervision, adversarial refinement, and incremental learning, setting a new standard for LLM proficiency in complex function calling.</p></details> |  |

They are programs to determine cryptocurrency transactions, and are irreversible once deployed, making it crucial for cryptocurrency investors to understand the cryptocurrency transaction behaviors of smart contracts comprehensively. However, it is a challenging (if not impossible) task for investors, as they do not necessarily have a programming background to check the complex source code. Even for investors with certain programming skills, inferring all the potential behaviors from the code alone is still difficult, since the actual behaviors can be different when different investors are involved. To address this challenge, we propose PrettiSmart, a novel visualization approach via execution simulation to achieve intuitive and reliable visual interpretation of smart contracts. Specifically, we develop a simulator to comprehensively capture most of the possible real-world smart contract behaviors, involving multiple investors and various smart contract functions. Then, we present PrettiSmart to intuitively visualize the simulation results of a smart contract, which consists of two modules: The Simulation Overview Module is a barcode-based design, providing a visual summary for each simulation, and the Simulation Detail Module is an augmented sequential design to display the cryptocurrency transaction details in each simulation, such as function call sequences, cryptocurrency flows, and state variable changes. It can allow investors to intuitively inspect and understand how a smart contract will work. We evaluate PrettiSmart through two case studies and in-depth user interviews with 12 investors. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and usability of PrettiSmart in facilitating an easy interpretation of smart contracts.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Dark Side of Function Calling: Pathways to Jailbreaking Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17915v4)** | 2024-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, but their power comes with significant security considerations. While extensive research has been conducted on the safety of LLMs in chat mode, the security implications of their function calling feature have been largely overlooked. This paper uncovers a critical vulnerability in the function calling process of LLMs, introducing a novel "jailbreak function" attack method that exploits alignment discrepancies, user coercion, and the absence of rigorous safety filters. Our empirical study, conducted on six state-of-the-art LLMs including GPT-4o, Claude-3.5-Sonnet, and Gemini-1.5-pro, reveals an alarming average success rate of over 90\% for this attack. We provide a comprehensive analysis of why function calls are susceptible to such attacks and propose defensive strategies, including the use of defensive prompts. Our findings highlight the urgent need for enhanced security measures in the function calling capabilities of LLMs, contributing to the field of AI safety by identifying a previously unexplored risk, designing an effective attack method, and suggesting practical defensive measures.

Further improving the performance and robustness of community detection has attracted significant attention. This paper considers edge noise, which causes edges in the network to be added or removed. Existing methods achieve graph denoising through link prediction or robustness in low eigenvectors. However, they are either limited in application scenarios or not determined for effectiveness. We find that the noisy pixel in the adjacency matrix has a certain proportion in the loss function, which makes the optimization of the community detection model seriously deviate from the correct direction. Thus, we design an flexible framework to silence the contribution of noisy pixels to loss function, called Silencer. We take the nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) and deep NMF methods as examples since they are the prime models for community detection. We first prove the convergence of Silencer in NMF. Compared with existing methods, Silencer show top performance in six real-world networks with random noise, adversarial perturbation, and mixed noise. Moreover, Silencer works on random (ER), scale-free (BA), and small-world (WS) networks, and the improvement of Silencer is gradually insignificant in the order ER, BA, and WS networks.</p></details> |  |

By leveraging these APIs as functional tools, enterprises can design diverse, scenario-specific agent applications, driven by on-premise function-calling models as the core engine. However, generic models often fail to meet enterprise requirements in terms of computational efficiency, output accuracy, and stability, necessitating scenario-specific adaptation. In this paper, we propose a training pipeline for function-calling capabilities tailored to real-world business scenarios. This pipeline includes the synthesis and augmentation of scenario-specific function-calling data, model fine-tuning, and performance evaluation and analysis. Using this pipeline, we generated 1,260 fully AI-generated samples and 1,035 augmented manually-labeled samples in digital HR agent scenario. The Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct model was employed as the base model and fine-tuned using the LoRA method on four GPUs with 24GB VRAM. Our fine-tuned model demonstrated outstanding performance in evaluations and practical applications, surpassing GPT-4 and GPT-4o in accuracy on the test set. These results validate the reliability of the proposed pipeline for training scenario-specific function-calling models.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 6 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

In this case, developers rely on stack traces, i.e., series of function calls that led to the error. Since there can be tens and hundreds of thousands of them describing the same issue from different users, automatic deduplication into categories is necessary to allow for processing. Recent works have proposed powerful deep learning-based approaches for this, but they are evaluated and compared in isolation from real-life workflows, and it is not clear whether they will actually work well at scale. To overcome this gap, this work presents three main contributions: a novel model, an industry-based dataset, and a multi-faceted evaluation. Our model consists of two parts - (1) an embedding model with byte-pair encoding and approximate nearest neighbor search to quickly find the most relevant stack traces to the incoming one, and (2) a reranker that re-ranks the most fitting stack traces, taking into account the repeated frames between them. To complement the existing datasets collected from open-source projects, we share with the community SlowOps - a dataset of stack traces from IntelliJ-based products developed by JetBrains, which has an order of magnitude more stack traces per category. Finally, we carry out an evaluation that strives to be realistic: measuring not only the accuracy of categorization, but also the operation time and the ability to create new categories. The evaluation shows that our model strikes a good balance - it outperforms other models on both open-source datasets and SlowOps, while also being faster on time than most. We release all of our code and data, and hope that our work can pave the way to further practice-oriented research in the area.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at SANER'25. 11 pages, 2 figures</p></details> |
| **[Unlock the Correlation between Supervised Fine-Tuning and Reinforcement Learning in Training Code Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10305v2)** | 2024-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatic code generation has been a longstanding research topic. With the advancement of general-purpose large language models (LLMs), the ability to code stands out as one important measure to the model's reasoning performance. Usually, a two-stage training paradigm is implemented to obtain a Code LLM, namely the pretraining and the fine-tuning. Within the fine-tuning, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and reinforcement learning (RL) are often used to improve the model's zero-shot ability. A large number of work has been conducted to improve the model's performance on code-related benchmarks with either modifications to the algorithm or refinement of the dataset. However, we still lack a deep insight into the correlation between SFT and RL. For instance, what kind of dataset should be used to ensure generalization, or what if we abandon the SFT phase in fine-tuning. In this work, we make an attempt to understand the correlation between SFT and RL. To facilitate our research, we manually craft 100 basis python functions, called atomic functions, and then a synthesizing pipeline is deployed to create a large number of synthetic functions on top of the atomic ones. In this manner, we ensure that the train and test sets remain distinct, preventing data contamination. Through comprehensive ablation study, we find: (1) Both atomic and synthetic functions are indispensable for SFT's generalization, and only a handful of synthetic functions are adequate; (2) Through RL, the SFT's generalization to target domain can be greatly enhanced, even with the same training prompts; (3) Training RL from scratch can alleviate the over-fitting issue introduced in the SFT phase.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tube Loss: A Novel Approach for Prediction Interval Estimation and probabilistic forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06853v2)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a novel loss function, called 'Tube Loss', for simultaneous estimation of bounds of a Prediction Interval (PI) in the regression setup, and also for generating probabilistic forecasts from time series data solving a single optimization problem. The PIs obtained by minimizing the empirical risk based on the Tube Loss are shown to be of better quality than the PIs obtained by the existing methods in the following sense. First, it yields intervals that attain the prespecified confidence level $t \in(0,1)$ asymptotically. A theoretical proof of this fact is given. Secondly, the user is allowed to move the interval up or down by controlling the value of a parameter. This helps the user to choose a PI capturing denser regions of the probability distribution of the response variable inside the interval, and thus, sharpening its width. This is shown to be especially useful when the conditional distribution of the response variable is skewed. Further, the Tube Loss based PI estimation method can trade-off between the coverage and the average width by solving a single optimization problem. It enables further reduction of the average width of PI through re-calibration. Also, unlike a few existing PI estimation methods the gradient descent (GD) method can be used for minimization of empirical risk. Finally, through extensive experimentation, we have shown the efficacy of the Tube Loss based PI estimation in kernel machines, neural networks and deep networks and also for probabilistic forecasting tasks. The codes of the experiments are available at https://github.com/ltpritamanand/Tube_loss</p></details> |  |

However, the process can be protracted and resource-intensive, especially when confronted with extensive codebases. In this work, I present FuzzDistill, an approach that harnesses compile-time data and machine learning to refine fuzzing targets. By analyzing compile-time information, such as function call graphs' features, loop information, and memory operations, FuzzDistill identifies high-priority areas of the codebase that are more probable to contain vulnerabilities. I demonstrate the efficacy of my approach through experiments conducted on real-world software, demonstrating substantial reductions in testing time.</p></details> |  |
| **[Asynchronous LLM Function Calling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07017v1)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) use function calls to interface with external tools and data source. However, the current approach to LLM function calling is inherently synchronous, where each call blocks LLM inference, limiting LLM operation and concurrent function execution. In this work, we propose AsyncLM, a system for asynchronous LLM function calling. AsyncLM improves LLM's operational efficiency by enabling LLMs to generate and execute function calls concurrently. Instead of waiting for each call's completion, AsyncLM introduces an interrupt mechanism to asynchronously notify the LLM in-flight when function calls return. We design an in-context protocol for function calls and interrupts, provide fine-tuning strategy to adapt LLMs to the interrupt semantics, and implement these mechanisms efficiently on LLM inference process. We demonstrate that AsyncLM can reduce end-to-end task completion latency from 1.6x-5.4x compared to synchronous function calling on a set of benchmark tasks in the Berkeley function calling leaderboard (BFCL). Furthermore, we discuss how interrupt mechanisms can be extended to enable novel human-LLM or LLM-LLM interactions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning from Snapshots of Discrete and Continuous Data Streams](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06079v1)** | 2024-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Imagine a smart camera trap selectively clicking pictures to understand animal movement patterns within a particular habitat. These "snapshots", or pieces of data captured from a data stream at adaptively chosen times, provide a glimpse of different animal movements unfolding through time. Learning a continuous-time process through snapshots, such as smart camera traps, is a central theme governing a wide array of online learning situations. In this paper, we adopt a learning-theoretic perspective in understanding the fundamental nature of learning different classes of functions from both discrete data streams and continuous data streams. In our first framework, the \textit{update-and-deploy} setting, a learning algorithm discretely queries from a process to update a predictor designed to make predictions given as input the data stream. We construct a uniform sampling algorithm that can learn with bounded error any concept class with finite Littlestone dimension. Our second framework, known as the \emph{blind-prediction} setting, consists of a learning algorithm generating predictions independently of observing the process, only engaging with the process when it chooses to make queries. Interestingly, we show a stark contrast in learnability where non-trivial concept classes are unlearnable. However, we show that adaptive learning algorithms are necessary to learn sets of time-dependent and data-dependent functions, called pattern classes, in either framework. Finally, we develop a theory of pattern classes under discrete data streams for the blind-prediction setting.</p></details> |  |

In modern software development, the use of external libraries and packages is increasingly prevalent, streamlining the software development process and enabling developers to deploy feature-rich systems with little coding. While this reliance on reusing code offers substantial benefits, it also introduces serious risks for deployed software in the form of malicious packages - harmful and vulnerable code disguised as useful libraries. Aims. Popular ecosystems, such PyPI, receive thousands of new package contributions every week, and distinguishing safe contributions from harmful ones presents a significant challenge. There is a dire need for reliable methods to detect and address the presence of malicious packages in these environments. Method. To address these challenges, we propose a data-driven approach that uses machine learning and static analysis to examine the package's metadata, code, files, and textual characteristics to identify malicious packages. Results. In evaluations conducted within the PyPI ecosystem, we achieved an F1-measure of 0.94 for identifying malicious packages using a stacking ensemble classifier. Conclusions. This tool can be seamlessly integrated into package vetting pipelines and has the capability to flag entire packages, not just malicious function calls. This enhancement strengthens security measures and reduces the manual workload for developers and registry maintainers, thereby contributing to the overall integrity of the ecosystem.</p></details> |  |

Research indicates that over 40% of potential energy savings can be achieved during the early design stage. Therefore, decision-making in green building design (DGBD), which is based on modeling and performance simulation, is crucial for reducing building energy costs. However, the field of green building encompasses a broad range of specialized knowledge, which involves significant learning costs and results in low decision-making efficiency. Many studies have already applied artificial intelligence (AI) methods to this field. Based on previous research, this study innovatively integrates large language models with DGBD, creating GreenQA, a question answering framework for multimodal data reasoning. Utilizing Retrieval Augmented Generation, Chain of Thought, and Function Call methods, GreenQA enables multimodal question answering, including weather data analysis and visualization, retrieval of green building cases, and knowledge query. Additionally, this study conducted a user survey using the GreenQA web platform. The results showed that 96% of users believed the platform helped improve design efficiency.

In real-world scenarios, user questions often require retrieving answers that are distributed across multiple tables. GraphRAG has recently attracted much attention for enhancing LLMs' reasoning capabilities by organizing external knowledge to address ad-hoc and complex questions, exemplifying a promising direction for cross-table question answering. In this paper, to address the current gap in available data, we first introduce a multi-table benchmark, MutliTableQA, comprising 60k tables and 25k user queries collected from real-world sources. Then, we propose the first Graph-Table-RAG framework, namely GTR, which reorganizes table corpora into a heterogeneous graph, employs a hierarchical coarse-to-fine retrieval process to extract the most relevant tables, and integrates graph-aware prompting for downstream LLMs' tabular reasoning. Extensive experiments show that GTR exhibits superior cross-table question-answering performance while maintaining high deployment efficiency, demonstrating its real-world practical applicability.</p></details> | 20 pages, 7 figures |

However, despite with intrinsic world knowledge, their application on structured tabular data prediction still lags behind, primarily due to the numerical insensitivity and modality discrepancy that brings a gap between LLM reasoning and statistical tabular learning. Unlike textual or vision data (e.g., electronic clinical notes or medical imaging data), tabular data is often presented in heterogeneous numerical values (e.g., CBC reports). This ubiquitous data format requires intensive expert annotation, and its numerical nature limits LLMs' capability to effectively transfer untapped domain expertise. In this paper, we propose SERSAL, a general self-prompting method by synergy learning with small models to enhance LLM tabular prediction in an unsupervised manner. Specifically, SERSAL utilizes the LLM's prior outcomes as original soft noisy annotations, which are dynamically leveraged to teach a better small student model. Reversely, the outcomes from the trained small model are used to teach the LLM to further refine its real capability. This process can be repeatedly applied to gradually distill refined knowledge for continuous progress. Comprehensive experiments on widely used medical domain tabular datasets show that, without access to gold labels, applying SERSAL to OpenAI GPT reasoning process attains substantial improvement compared to linguistic prompting methods, which serves as an orthogonal direction for tabular LLM, and increasing prompting bonus is observed as more powerful LLMs appear.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025.

In this work, we address this concern for tabular data. Specifically, we introduce a variety of different techniques to assess whether a language model has seen a tabular dataset during training. This investigation reveals that LLMs have memorized many popular tabular datasets verbatim. We then compare the few-shot learning performance of LLMs on datasets that were seen during training to the performance on datasets released after training. We find that LLMs perform better on datasets seen during training, indicating that memorization leads to overfitting. At the same time, LLMs show non-trivial performance on novel datasets and are surprisingly robust to data transformations. We then investigate the in-context statistical learning abilities of LLMs. While LLMs are significantly better than random at solving statistical classification problems, the sample efficiency of few-shot learning lags behind traditional statistical learning algorithms, especially as the dimension of the problem increases. This suggests that much of the observed few-shot performance on novel real-world datasets is due to the LLM's world knowledge. Overall, our results highlight the importance of testing whether an LLM has seen an evaluation dataset during pre-training. We release the https://github.com/interpretml/LLM-Tabular-Memorization-Checker Python package to test LLMs for memorization of tabular datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>COLM ...</summary><p>COLM camera ready, fix typo</p></details> |

Since it is impossible to generalize to a completely new and unknown domain, we study models that are easy to adapt to the target domain even with few labeled examples. We focus on building more informative representations of tabular data that can mitigate $Y|X$-shifts, and propose to leverage the prior world knowledge in LLMs by serializing (write down) the tabular data to encode it. We find LLM embeddings alone provide inconsistent improvements in robustness, but models trained on them can be well adapted/finetuned to the target domain even using 32 labeled observations. Our finding is based on a comprehensive and systematic study consisting of 7650 source-target pairs and benchmark against 261,000 model configurations trained by 22 algorithms. Our observation holds when ablating the size of accessible target data and different adaptation strategies.

Starting with simple qualitative tests for whether an LLM knows the names and values of features, we introduce a variety of different techniques to assess the degrees of contamination, including statistical tests for conditional distribution modeling and four tests that identify memorization. Our investigation reveals that LLMs are pre-trained on many popular tabular datasets. This exposure can lead to invalid performance evaluation on downstream tasks because the LLMs have, in effect, been fit to the test set. Interestingly, we also identify a regime where the language model reproduces important statistics of the data, but fails to reproduce the dataset verbatim. On these datasets, although seen during training, good performance on downstream tasks might not be due to overfitting. Our findings underscore the need for ensuring data integrity in machine learning tasks with LLMs. To facilitate future research, we release an open-source tool that can perform various tests for memorization \url{https://github.com/interpretml/LLM-Tabular-Memorization-Checker}.</p></details> | <details><summary>Table...</summary><p>Table Representation Learning Workshop at NeurIPS 2023</p></details> |
