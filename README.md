| **[SBASH: a Framework for Designing and Evaluating RAG vs. Prompt-Tuned LLM Honeypots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21459v1)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Honeypots are decoy systems used for gathering valuable threat intelligence or diverting attackers away from production systems. Maximising attacker engagement is essential to their utility. However research has highlighted that context-awareness, such as the ability to respond to new attack types, systems and attacker agents, is necessary to increase engagement. Large Language Models (LLMs) have been shown as one approach to increase context awareness but suffer from several challenges including accuracy and timeliness of response time, high operational costs and data-protection issues due to cloud deployment. We propose the System-Based Attention Shell Honeypot (SBASH) framework which manages data-protection issues through the use of lightweight local LLMs. We investigate the use of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) supported LLMs and non-RAG LLMs for Linux shell commands and evaluate them using several different metrics such as response time differences, realism from human testers, and similarity to a real system calculated with Levenshtein distance, SBert, and BertScore. We show that RAG improves accuracy for untuned models while models that have been tuned via a system prompt that tells the LLM to respond like a Linux system achieve without RAG a similar accuracy as untuned with RAG, while having a slightly lower latency.</p></details> | <details><summary>to be...</summary><p>to be published in: The 3rd International Conference on Foundation and Large Language Models (FLLM2025), IEEE, 2025</p></details> |
| **[SUBQRAG: Sub-Question Driven Dynamic Graph RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07718v2)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Graph RAG) effectively builds a knowledge graph (KG) to connect disparate facts across a large document corpus. However, this broad-view approach often lacks the deep structured reasoning needed for complex multi-hop question answering (QA), leading to incomplete evidence and error accumulation. To address these limitations, we propose SubQRAG, a sub-question-driven framework that enhances reasoning depth. SubQRAG decomposes a complex question into an ordered chain of verifiable sub-questions. For each sub-question, it retrieves relevant triples from the graph. When the existing graph is insufficient, the system dynamically expands it by extracting new triples from source documents in real time. All triples used in the reasoning process are aggregated into a "graph memory," forming a structured and traceable evidence path for final answer generation. Experiments on three multi-hop QA benchmarks demonstrate that SubQRAG achieves consistent and significant improvements, especially in Exact Match scores.</p></details> | 5 pages, 1 figure |
| **[Bridging Language Gaps with Adaptive RAG: Improving Indonesian Language Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21068v1)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Question Answering (QA) has seen significant improvements with the advancement of machine learning models, further studies enhanced this question answering system by retrieving external information, called Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to produce more accurate and informative answers. However, these state-of-the-art-performance is predominantly in English language. To address this gap we made an effort of bridging language gaps by incorporating Adaptive RAG system to Indonesian language. Adaptive RAG system integrates a classifier whose task is to distinguish the question complexity, which in turn determines the strategy for answering the question. To overcome the limited availability of Indonesian language dataset, our study employs machine translation as data augmentation approach. Experiments show reliable question complexity classifier; however, we observed significant inconsistencies in multi-retrieval answering strategy which negatively impacted the overall evaluation when this strategy was applied. These findings highlight both the promise and challenges of question answering in low-resource language suggesting directions for future improvement.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 7 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[Practical Code RAG at Scale: Task-Aware Retrieval Design Choices under Compute Budgets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20609v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study retrieval design for code-focused generation tasks under realistic compute budgets. Using two complementary tasks from Long Code Arena -- code completion and bug localization -- we systematically compare retrieval configurations across various context window sizes along three axes: (i) chunking strategy, (ii) similarity scoring, and (iii) splitting granularity. (1) For PL-PL, sparse BM25 with word-level splitting is the most effective and practical, significantly outperforming dense alternatives while being an order of magnitude faster. (2) For NL-PL, proprietary dense encoders (Voyager-3 family) consistently beat sparse retrievers, however requiring 100x larger latency. (3) Optimal chunk size scales with available context: 32-64 line chunks work best at small budgets, and whole-file retrieval becomes competitive at 16000 tokens. (4) Simple line-based chunking matches syntax-aware splitting across budgets. (5) Retrieval latency varies by up to 200x across configurations; BPE-based splitting is needlessly slow, and BM25 + word splitting offers the best quality-latency trade-off. Thus, we provide evidence-based recommendations for implementing effective code-oriented RAG systems based on task requirements, model constraints, and computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[HA-RAG: Hotness-Aware RAG Acceleration via Mixed Precision and Data Placement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20878v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) improves model output accuracy by leveraging external knowledge bases, serving as an effective solution to address hallucination issues and knowledge-update delays in Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the introduction of external knowledge bases presents RAG with challenges in long-context processing, significantly increasing memory consumption and inference latency. Existing research accelerates inference by precomputing Key and Value (KV) of the knowledge base and loading them on-demand during inference. Based on the access frequency of different KV chunks within the external knowledge base, this paper proposes a hotness-aware RAG (HA-RAG) inference optimization system. First, leveraging the numerical distribution of KV chunks, we introduce a hotness-aware mixed-precision compressing and loading method to reduce disk I/O and memory access overhead. Second, we design a hotness-aware data placement strategy that prioritizes storing frequently accessed KV chunks in high-speed memory to improve data access efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared with TurboRAG, the proposed HA-RAG achieves an average speedup of 2.10x and maximum speedup of 10.49x in Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) with negligible accuracy loss.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages,16 figures,2 tables</p></details> |
| **[More Documents, Same Length: Isolating the Challenge of Multiple Documents in RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04388v2)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances the accuracy of Large Language Model (LLM) responses by leveraging relevant external documents during generation. Although previous studies noted that retrieving many documents can degrade performance, they did not isolate how the quantity of documents affects performance while controlling for context length. We evaluate various language models on custom datasets derived from a multi-hop QA task. We keep the context length and position of relevant information constant while varying the number of documents, and find that increasing the document count in RAG settings poses significant challenges for most LLMs, reducing performance by up to 20%. However, Qwen2.5 maintained consistent results across increasing document counts, indicating better multi-document handling capability. Finally, our results indicate that processing multiple documents is a separate challenge from handling long contexts. We also make the datasets and code available: https://github.com/shaharl6000/MoreDocsSameLen .</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[RAG-Stack: Co-Optimizing RAG Quality and Performance From the Vector Database Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20296v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as one of the most prominent applications of vector databases. By integrating documents retrieved from a database into the prompt of a large language model (LLM), RAG enables more reliable and informative content generation. While there has been extensive research on vector databases, many open research problems remain once they are considered in the wider context of end-to-end RAG pipelines. One practical yet challenging problem is how to jointly optimize both system performance and generation quality in RAG, which is significantly more complex than it appears due to the numerous knobs on both the algorithmic side (spanning models and databases) and the systems side (from software to hardware). In this paper, we present RAG-Stack, a three-pillar blueprint for quality-performance co-optimization in RAG systems. RAG-Stack comprises: (1) RAG-IR, an intermediate representation that serves as an abstraction layer to decouple quality and performance aspects; (2) RAG-CM, a cost model for estimating system performance given an RAG-IR; and (3) RAG-PE, a plan exploration algorithm that searches for high-quality, high-performance RAG configurations. We believe this three-pillar blueprint will become the de facto paradigm for RAG quality-performance co-optimization in the years to come.</p></details> |  |
| **[Balancing Fine-tuning and RAG: A Hybrid Strategy for Dynamic LLM Recommendation Updates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20260v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) empower recommendation systems through their advanced reasoning and planning capabilities. However, the dynamic nature of user interests and content poses a significant challenge: While initial fine-tuning aligns LLMs with domain knowledge and user preferences, it fails to capture such real-time changes, necessitating robust update mechanisms. This paper investigates strategies for updating LLM-powered recommenders, focusing on the trade-offs between ongoing fine-tuning and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Using an LLM-powered user interest exploration system as a case study, we perform a comparative analysis of these methods across dimensions like cost, agility, and knowledge incorporation. We propose a hybrid update strategy that leverages the long-term knowledge adaptation of periodic fine-tuning with the agility of low-cost RAG. We demonstrate through live A/B experiments on a billion-user platform that this hybrid approach yields statistically significant improvements in user satisfaction, offering a practical and cost-effective framework for maintaining high-quality LLM-powered recommender systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>RecSy...</summary><p>RecSys 2025 Industry Track</p></details> |

The approach leverages the full-page context of book illustrations from the Holy Roman Empire, allowing the LLM to generate detailed descriptions that incorporate both visual and textual elements. These descriptions are then matched to relevant Iconclass codes through a hybrid vector search. This method achieves 87% and 92% precision at five and four levels of classification, significantly outperforming traditional image and keyword-based searches. By employing full-page descriptions and RAG, the system enhances classification accuracy, offering a powerful tool for large-scale analysis of early modern visual archives. This interdisciplinary approach demonstrates the growing potential of LLMs and RAG in advancing research within art history and digital humanities.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 7 figures.

| **[Policy-Governed RAG - Research Design Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19877v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A policy-governed RAG architecture is specified for audit-ready generation in regulated workflows, organized as a triptych: (I) Contracts/Control (SHRDLU-like), which governs output adherence to legal and internal policies; (II) Manifests/Trails (Memex-like), which cryptographically anchors all cited source evidence to ensure verifiable provenance; and (III) Receipts/Verification (Xanadu-like), which provides the final, portable proof of compliance for auditors (portable COSE/JOSE) (see Section 4 and Appendix A). Rather than explaining model internals, outputs are gated ex-ante and bound to cryptographically verifiable evidence for each material answer. Unvalidated targets are stated (>=20% relative reduction in confident errors; p95 latency <= 900 ms; <= 2.2x serve cost) together with a pre-registered (optional) pilot using NO-GO gates. The design complements existing RAG/guardrails by making policy checks auditable, replayable, and receipt-backed. Target domains include back-office compliance in pharma, medical devices, finance, legal, and the public sector where error costs may exceed thousands of euros and audit trails are mandatory under regulations such as the EU AI Act. Future evaluations may pre-commit to publishing negative results when any example NO-GO gate is not met.</p></details> | 51 pages, 8 figures |

| **[Automated Detection of Visual Attribute Reliance with a Self-Reflective Agent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21704v1)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When a vision model performs image recognition, which visual attributes drive its predictions? Detecting unintended reliance on specific visual features is critical for ensuring model robustness, preventing overfitting, and avoiding spurious correlations. We introduce an automated framework for detecting such dependencies in trained vision models. At the core of our method is a self-reflective agent that systematically generates and tests hypotheses about visual attributes that a model may rely on. This process is iterative: the agent refines its hypotheses based on experimental outcomes and uses a self-evaluation protocol to assess whether its findings accurately explain model behavior. When inconsistencies arise, the agent self-reflects over its findings and triggers a new cycle of experimentation. We evaluate our approach on a novel benchmark of 130 models designed to exhibit diverse visual attribute dependencies across 18 categories. Our results show that the agent's performance consistently improves with self-reflection, with a significant performance increase over non-reflective baselines. We further demonstrate that the agent identifies real-world visual attribute dependencies in state-of-the-art models, including CLIP's vision encoder and the YOLOv8 object detector.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 10 figures, Neurips 2025</p></details> |
| **[A Knowledge-Graph Translation Layer for Mission-Aware Multi-Agent Path Planning in Spatiotemporal Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21695v1)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The coordination of autonomous agents in dynamic environments is hampered by the semantic gap between high-level mission objectives and low-level planner inputs. To address this, we introduce a framework centered on a Knowledge Graph (KG) that functions as an intelligent translation layer. The KG's two-plane architecture compiles declarative facts into per-agent, mission-aware ``worldviews" and physics-aware traversal rules, decoupling mission semantics from a domain-agnostic planner. This allows complex, coordinated paths to be modified simply by changing facts in the KG. A case study involving Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) in the Gulf of Mexico visually demonstrates the end-to-end process and quantitatively proves that different declarative policies produce distinct, high-performing outcomes. This work establishes the KG not merely as a data repository, but as a powerful, stateful orchestrator for creating adaptive and explainable autonomous systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 10 figures, conference submission</p></details> |
| **[Intrinsic Goals for Autonomous Agents: Model-Based Exploration in Virtual Zebrafish Predicts Ethological Behavior and Whole-Brain Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00138v2)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomy is a hallmark of animal intelligence, enabling adaptive and intelligent behavior in complex environments without relying on external reward or task structure. Existing reinforcement learning approaches to exploration in reward-free environments, including a class of methods known as model-based intrinsic motivation, exhibit inconsistent exploration patterns and do not converge to an exploratory policy, thus failing to capture robust autonomous behaviors observed in animals. Moreover, systems neuroscience has largely overlooked the neural basis of autonomy, focusing instead on experimental paradigms where animals are motivated by external reward rather than engaging in ethological, naturalistic and task-independent behavior. To bridge these gaps, we introduce a novel model-based intrinsic drive explicitly designed after the principles of autonomous exploration in animals. Our method (3M-Progress) achieves animal-like exploration by tracking divergence between an online world model and a fixed prior learned from an ecological niche. To the best of our knowledge, we introduce the first autonomous embodied agent that predicts brain data entirely from self-supervised optimization of an intrinsic goal -- without any behavioral or neural training data -- demonstrating that 3M-Progress agents capture the explainable variance in behavioral patterns and whole-brain neural-glial dynamics recorded from autonomously behaving larval zebrafish, thereby providing the first goal-driven, population-level model of neural-glial computation. Our findings establish a computational framework connecting model-based intrinsic motivation to naturalistic behavior, providing a foundation for building artificial agents with animal-like autonomy.</p></details> | 17 pages, 7 figures |
| **[SimuRA: A World-Model-Driven Simulative Reasoning Architecture for General Goal-Oriented Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23773v2)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI agents built on foundation models hold enormous promise. Current practice, however, focuses on a one-task-one-agent approach, which not only falls short of scalability and generality, but also faces practical limitations from black-box autoregressive reasoning, where decisions unfold token by token without explicit simulation or counterfactual evaluation of outcomes. Humans, on the other hand, reason and plan by mentally simulating the consequences of actions within an internal model of the world -- a capability that supports flexible, goal-directed behavior across diverse contexts. Moving towards a more general and powerful AI agent, we introduce SimuRA, a goal-oriented architecture for generalized agentic reasoning. Based on a principled formulation of an optimal agent in any general environment, SimuRA addresses the limitations of black-box autoregressive reasoning by incorporating the world model for planning via simulation. Our prototype world model is implemented using LLMs as a substrate, leveraging the natural language as a discrete, hierarchical representation grounded in concepts for planning, while remaining model-agnostic. On complex web-browsing tasks such as flight search, SimuRA improves the success rate from 0% to 32.2% compared to a representative open-web agent baseline. Across tasks, world-model-based planning achieves up to 124% higher task completion rates than a matched black-box autoregressive baseline, demonstrating the advantages of simulative reasoning. We release ReasonerAgent-Web, a web-browsing agent built on SimuRA, as an open-source research demo.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This submission has been updated to adjust the scope and presentation of the work</p></details> |

However, developing effective mobile GUI agents with reinforcement learning (RL) remains challenging due to the heavy-tailed distribution of task difficulty and the inefficiency of large-scale environment sampling. We present an online agentic reinforcement learning framework MobileRL to enhance GUI agents in mobile environments. Its core component is the Difficulty-ADAptive GRPO (ADAGRPO) algorithm. In ADAGRPO, we design difficulty-adaptive positive replay and failure curriculum filtering to adapt the model to different task difficulties. We introduce the shortest-path reward adjustment strategy to reshape rewards concerning the task length in multi-turn agentic tasks. Those strategies jointly stabilize RL training, improve sample efficiency, and generate strong performance across diverse mobile apps and tasks. We apply MOBILERL to two open models (Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct and GLM-4.1V-9B-Base). The resultant MOBILERL-9B model achieves state-of-the-art results in terms of success rates on both AndroidWorld (80.2%) and AndroidLab (53.6%). The MOBILERL framework is open-sourced at: https://github.com/THUDM/MobileRL.</p></details> |  |

| **[Blockwise SFT for Diffusion Language Models: Reconciling Bidirectional Attention and Autoregressive Decoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19529v2)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Discrete diffusion language models have shown strong potential for text generation, yet standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT) misaligns with their semi-autoregressive inference: training randomly masks tokens across the entire response, while inference generates fixed-size blocks sequentially. This mismatch introduces noisy prefixes and leaky suffixes, biasing gradients away from the desired blockwise likelihood. We propose Blockwise SFT, which partitions responses into fixed-size blocks, selects one active block per step for stochastic masking, freezes all preceding tokens, and fully hides future ones. Loss is computed only over the active block, directly mirroring the blockwise decoding process. Experiments on GSM8K, MATH, and MetaMathQA show consistent gains over classical SFT under equal compute or token budgets. Block size consistency studies and ablations confirm that improvements stem from faithful training-inference alignment rather than incidental masking effects. Our results highlight the importance of matching supervision granularity to the decoding procedure in diffusion-based language models.</p></details> |  |
| **[RL makes MLLMs see better than SFT](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16333v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A dominant assumption in Multimodal Language Model (MLLM) research is that its performance is largely inherited from the LLM backbone, given its immense parameter scale and remarkable capabilities. This has created a void in the understanding of the vision encoder, which determines how MLLMs perceive images. The recent shift in MLLM training paradigms, from Supervised Finetuning (SFT) to Reinforcement Learning (RL), magnifies this oversight-namely, the significant lack of analysis on how such training reshapes the vision encoder as well as the MLLM. To address this, we first investigate the impact of training strategies on MLLMs, where RL shows a clear advantage over SFT in strongly vision-related VQA benchmarks. Motivated by this, we conduct a critical yet under-explored analysis of the vision encoder of MLLMs through diverse and in-depth experiments, ranging from ImageNet classification and segmentation to gradient visualization. Our results demonstrate that MLLM's post-training strategy (i.e., SFT or RL) not only leads to distinct outcomes on MLLM downstream tasks, but also fundamentally reshapes MLLM's underlying visual representations. Specifically, the key finding of our study is that RL produces stronger and precisely localized visual representations compared to SFT, boosting the ability of the vision encoder for MLLM. We then reframe our findings into a simple recipe for building strong vision encoders for MLLMs, Preference-Instructed Vision OpTimization (PIVOT). When integrated into MLLMs, a PIVOT-trained vision encoder outperforms even larger and more heavily-trained counterparts, despite requiring less than 1% of the computational cost of standard vision pretraining. This result opens an effective and efficient path for advancing the vision backbones of MLLMs. Project page available at https://june-page.github.io/pivot/</p></details> |  |
| **[On Countable SFT Covers of Sparse Multidimensional Shift Spaces](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14967v2)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A multidimensional sofic shift is called countably covered if it has an SFT cover containing only countably many configurations. In contrast to the one-dimensional setting, not all countable sofic shifts are countably covered. We investigate the existence of countable covers for gap width shifts, where the number of nonzero symbols in a configuration is bounded by a function of the minimum distance between two such symbols. As our main results, we characterize those one-dimensional gap width shifts whose two-dimensional lift is a countably covered sofic shift, and show that a large class of two-dimensional gap width shifts are countably covered.</p></details> | 38 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Beyond Two-Stage Training: Cooperative SFT and RL for LLM Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06948v2)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven effective in incentivizing the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), but suffers from severe efficiency challenges due to its trial-and-error nature. While the common practice employs supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a warm-up stage for RL, this decoupled two-stage approach suffers from catastrophic forgetting: second-stage RL gradually loses SFT-acquired behaviors and inefficiently explores new patterns. This study introduces a novel method for learning reasoning models that employs bilevel optimization to facilitate better cooperation between these training paradigms. By conditioning the SFT objective on the optimal RL policy, our approach enables SFT to meta-learn how to guide RL's optimization process. During training, the lower level performs RL updates while simultaneously receiving SFT supervision, and the upper level explicitly maximizes the cooperative gain-the performance advantage of joint SFT-RL training over RL alone. Empirical evaluations on five reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms baselines and achieves a better balance between effectiveness and efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Generalization of SFT: A Reinforcement Learning Perspective with Reward Rectification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05629v2)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a simple yet theoretically motivated improvement to Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) for the Large Language Model (LLM), addressing its limited generalization compared to reinforcement learning (RL). Through mathematical analysis, we reveal that standard SFT gradients implicitly encode a problematic reward structure that may severely restrict the generalization capabilities of model. To rectify this, we propose Dynamic Fine-Tuning (DFT), stabilizing gradient updates for each token by dynamically rescaling the objective function with the probability of this token. Remarkably, this single-line code change significantly outperforms standard SFT across multiple challenging benchmarks and base models, demonstrating greatly improved generalization. Additionally, our approach shows competitive results in offline RL settings, offering an effective yet simpler alternative. This work bridges theoretical insight and practical solutions, substantially advancing SFT performance.

| **[RLSR: Reinforcement Learning with Supervised Reward Outperforms SFT in Instruction Following](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14200v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>After the pretraining stage of LLMs, techniques such as SFT, RLHF, RLVR, and RFT are applied to enhance instruction-following ability, mitigate undesired responses, improve reasoning capability and enable efficient domain adaptation with minimal data. SFT relies on the next-token prediction objective to strengthen instruction following in a base model using a large corpus of human-labeled responses. In contrast, RFT employs a RL-based approach to adapt fine-tuned reasoning models to specific domains with limited supervision. Inspired by RFT, we propose replacing SFT with RLSR to leverage the extensive SFT dataset in an RL framework, thereby improving the base model's instruction-following ability. In RLSR, the base model generates multiple responses for each prompt, and reward scores are computed as the cosine similarity in the semantic embedding space between the generated and human-labeled responses. RLSR can be utilized in multiple ways. It can directly replace SFT, achieving superior performance on instruction-following benchmarks-for example, RLSR (SB) on Qwen-7B (INFINITY) achieved an AlpacaEval win rate of 26.34%, surpassing SFT's 21.01%. Furthermore, combining SFT and RLSR further enhances downstream task performance; Qwen-7B (INFINITY) achieved a win rate of 30.73% when trained with SFT + RLSR.</p></details> |  |
| **[Do We Really Need SFT? Prompt-as-Policy over Knowledge Graphs for Cold-start Next POI Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08012v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Next point-of-interest (POI) recommendation is crucial for smart urban services such as tourism, dining, and transportation, yet most approaches struggle under cold-start conditions where user-POI interactions are sparse. Recent efforts leveraging large language models (LLMs) address this challenge through either supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or in-context learning (ICL). However, SFT demands costly annotations and fails to generalize to inactive users, while static prompts in ICL cannot adapt to diverse user contexts. To overcome these limitations, we propose Prompt-as-Policy over knowledge graphs, a reinforcement-guided prompting framework that learns to construct prompts dynamically through contextual bandit optimization. Our method treats prompt construction as a learnable policy that adaptively determines (i) which relational evidences to include, (ii) the number of evidence per candidate, and (iii) their organization and ordering within prompts. More specifically, we construct a knowledge graph (KG) to discover candidates and mine relational paths, which are transformed into evidence cards that summarize rationales for each candidate POI. The frozen LLM then acts as a reasoning engine, generating recommendations from the KG-discovered candidate set based on the policy-optimized prompts. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that Prompt-as-Policy consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving average 7.7\% relative improvements in Acc@1 for inactive users, while maintaining competitive performance on active users, without requiring model fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Empowering Lightweight MLLMs with Reasoning via Long CoT SFT](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03321v2)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards has enhanced the reasoning of large-scale language models (LLMs), its efficacy for lightweight multimodal language models (MLLMs) with fewer than seven billion parameters remains underexplored. This paper investigates the role of long Chain-of-Thought (long CoT) data in enhancing the reasoning abilities of such MLLMs. Our findings demonstrate that Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with long CoT data significantly improves MLLM reasoning. Furthermore, we observe that after this initial SFT phase, MLLMs can achieve additional performance gains through a subsequent RL stage. We conclude that a SFT stage with long CoT data is a critical prerequisite for developing the reasoning capabilities of lightweight MLLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quagmires in SFT-RL Post-Training: When High SFT Scores Mislead and What to Use Instead](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01624v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In post-training for reasoning Large Language Models (LLMs), the current state of practice trains LLMs in two independent stages: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR, shortened as ``RL'' below). In this work, we challenge whether high SFT scores translate to improved performance after RL. We provide extensive counter-examples where this is not true. We find high SFT scores can be biased toward simpler or more homogeneous data and are not reliably predictive of subsequent RL gains or scaled-up post-training effectiveness. In some cases, RL training on models with improved SFT performance could lead to substantially worse outcome compared to RL on the base model without SFT. We study alternative metrics and identify generalization loss on held-out reasoning examples and Pass@large k performance to provide strong proxies for the RL outcome. We trained hundreds of models up to 12B-parameter with SFT and RLVR via GRPO and ran extensive evaluations on 7 math benchmarks with up to 256 repetitions, spending $>$1M GPU hours. Experiments include models from Llama3, Mistral-Nemo, Qwen3 and multiple state-of-the-art SFT/RL datasets. Compared to directly predicting from pre-RL performance, prediction based on generalization loss and Pass@large k achieves substantial higher precision, improving $R^2$ coefficient and Spearman's rank correlation coefficient by up to 0.5 (2x). This provides strong utility for broad use cases. For example, in most experiments, we find SFT training on unique examples for a one epoch underperforms training on half examples for two epochs, either after SFT or SFT-then-RL; With the same SFT budget, training only on short examples may lead to better SFT performance, though, it often leads to worse outcome after RL compared to training on examples with varying lengths.

We address this practical reliability gap by creating PureTC-1B, a three-stage stabilization pipeline for Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct (an open-weight, instruction-tuned model released by Meta) using parameter-efficient LoRA adapters. Our method combines Continual Pre-Training (CPT) on TC-centric corpora, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with instruction data, and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) using TC-adherence preferences to improve monolingual robustness without full-model retraining. On a benchmark designed to simulate real-world usage, PureTC-1B achieves a 51.3% relative reduction (micro-average) in non-TC output tokens versus the base model. On a Named Entity Translation (NET) task, PureTC-1B further reduces incorrect-language tokens by 77.2% relative to Llama-3B and 57.2% relative to Qwen-1.5B, indicating that robust TC adherence is attainable even at the 1B scale. The pipeline is reproducible, adapter-only, and hardware-friendly, offering practitioners a practical recipe to enhance language stability for TC and potentially other non-English languages.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 1 figures, 2 tables.

| **[Debunk the Myth of SFT Generalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00237v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A prevailing view holds that supervised fine-tuning (SFT) memorizes training data and fails to generalize, whereas reinforcement learning (RL) attains broader robustness. We revisit this claim through a systematic evaluation on two decision-making benchmarks, Sokoban and General Points, and arrive at a different conclusion. We show that much of SFT's perceived failure stems from frozen-prompt artifacts: when trained on fixed instruction templates, SFT models cling to training semantics rather than adapting to new ones. Introducing prompt diversity during training breaks this shortcut and yields strong generalization to unseen instruction variants without harming in-distribution performance. Beyond instruction shifts, we ask whether SFT can generalize to strictly harder tasks. Here, chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision provides an algorithmic scaffold that markedly improves transfer to more difficult regimes, such as larger Sokoban grids with additional boxes and arithmetic with out-of-distribution values or five-card compositions that increase combinatorial complexity. Finally, combining prompt diversity with CoT achieves the best of both worlds: robust generalization across both instruction-variant and difficulty-variant settings, matching or surpassing RL baselines on our benchmarks while retaining SFT's simplicity and stability. These findings challenge the narrative that SFT is inherently inferior to RL and support a data-centric perspective: with appropriately curated demonstrations, vanilla SFT can generalize as strongly as RL.

| **[Guard Vector: Beyond English LLM Guardrails with Task-Vector Composition and Streaming-Aware Prefix SFT](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23381v1)** | 2025-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Guard Vector, a safety task vector computed as the parameter difference between a guardrail model (Guard Model) and a same-architecture pretrained language model. Composing this vector with a target language model yields a Target Guard Model (TGM). We then adapt TGM with a streaming-aware approach that combines prefix-based training and evaluation with a classifier that produces a single-token output. With this composition alone, TGM improves classification quality over established Guard Models across standard safety suites and enables language extensibility to Chinese, Japanese, and Korean, requiring neither additional training nor target language labels. It also demonstrates model portability across two widely used public guardrail backbones, Llama and Gemma. With prefix SFT (supervised fine-tuning), TGM preserves classification quality under streaming by aligning the behavior between prefix inputs and full-text inputs. The single-token output design increases throughput and reduces latency. Together, these components reduce data and compute requirements while promoting streaming-aware evaluation practices, thereby contributing to a more responsible AI ecosystem.</p></details> |  |
| **[RL Squeezes, SFT Expands: A Comparative Study of Reasoning LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21128v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are typically trained by reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rewards (RLVR) and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on reasoning traces to improve their reasoning abilities. However, how these methods shape reasoning capabilities remains largely elusive. Going beyond an accuracy-based investigation of how these two components sculpt the reasoning process, this paper introduces a novel analysis framework that quantifies reasoning paths and captures their qualitative changes under each training process (with models of 1.5B, 7B, and 14B parameters on mathematical domains). Specifically, we investigate the reasoning process at two levels of granularity: the trajectory-level, which examines complete reasoning outputs, and the step-level, which analyzes reasoning graphs whose nodes correspond to individual reasoning steps. Notably, clustering of unique reasoning trajectories shows complementary effects: RL compresses incorrect trajectories, whereas SFT expands correct ones. Step-level analysis reveals that RL steepens (about 2.5 times), while SFT flattens (reduced to about one-third), the decay rates of node visitation frequency, degree, and betweenness centrality distributions in the reasoning graph. This indicates that RL concentrates reasoning functionality into a small subset of steps, while SFT homogenizes it across many steps. Furthermore, by evaluating the reasoning graph topologies from multiple perspectives, we delineate the shared and distinct characteristics of RL and SFT. Our work presents a novel reasoning path perspective that explains why the current best practice of two-stage training, with SFT followed by RL, is successful, and offers practical implications for data construction and more efficient learning approaches.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we revisit this trade-off and present both empirical and theoretical insights. First, we show that SFT does not always hurt: using a smaller learning rate can substantially mitigate general performance degradation while preserving comparable target-domain performance. We then provide a theoretical analysis that explains these phenomena and further motivates a new method, Token-Adaptive Loss Reweighting (TALR). Building on this, and recognizing that smaller learning rates alone do not fully eliminate general-performance degradation in all cases, we evaluate a range of strategies for reducing general capability loss, including L2 regularization, LoRA, model averaging, FLOW, and our proposed TALR. Experimental results demonstrate that while no method completely eliminates the trade-off, TALR consistently outperforms these baselines in balancing domain-specific gains and general capabilities. Finally, we distill our findings into practical guidelines for adapting LLMs to new domains: (i) using a small learning rate to achieve a favorable trade-off, and (ii) when a stronger balance is further desired, adopt TALR as an effective strategy.</p></details> |  |

Utilizing the Anthropic Helpful-Harmless RLHF dataset, we train and evaluate four models: the base OPT350M, an SFT model, a DPO model, and a model trained with both SFT and DPO. We introduce three key evaluation metrics: Harmlessness Rate (HmR), Helpfulness Rate (HpR), and a Combined Alignment Score (CAS), all derived from reward model outputs. The results show that while SFT outperforms DPO, The combined SFT+DPO model outperforms all others across all metrics, demonstrating the complementary nature of these techniques. Our findings also highlight challenges posed by noisy data, limited GPU resources, and training constraints.

However, the evolution and mechanism behind the synergy of SFT and RL are still under-explored and inconclusive. In our study, we find the well-known claim "SFT memorizes, RL generalizes" is over-simplified, and discover that: (1) OOD performance peaks at the early stage of SFT and then declines (OOD forgetting), the best SFT checkpoint cannot be captured by training/test loss; (2) the subsequent RL stage does not generate fundamentally better OOD capability, instead it plays an \textbf{OOD restoration} role, recovering the lost reasoning ability during SFT; (3) The recovery ability has boundaries, \ie{} \textbf{if SFT trains for too short or too long, RL cannot recover the lost OOD ability;} (4) To uncover the underlying mechanisms behind the forgetting and restoration process, we employ SVD analysis on parameter matrices, manually edit them, and observe their impacts on model performance. Unlike the common belief that the shift of model capacity mainly results from the changes of singular values, we find that they are actually quite stable throughout fine-tuning. Instead, the OOD behavior strongly correlates with the \textbf{rotation of singular vectors}. Our findings re-identify the roles of SFT and RL in the two-stage fine-tuning and discover the rotation of singular vectors as the key mechanism. %reversing the rotations induced by SFT, which shows recovery from forgetting, whereas imposing the SFT parameter directions onto a RL-tuned model results in performance degradation.

| **[Breaking the SFT Plateau: Multimodal Structured Reinforcement Learning for Chart-to-Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13587v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While reinforcement learning (RL) has proven highly effective for general reasoning in vision-language models, its application to tasks requiring in-depth understanding of information-rich images and generation of structured outputs remains underexplored. Chart-to-code generation exemplifies this challenge, demanding complex reasoning over visual charts to generate structured code. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) alone is often insufficient, highlighting the need for effective RL strategies that appropriately reward structured outputs. We systematically investigate the performance plateau in SFT through large-scale experiments and propose Multimodal Structured Reinforcement Learning (MSRL) for chart-to-code generation, which substantially breaks through this plateau. We construct the largest training corpus to date, containing 3 million chart-code pairs from real-world arXiv tables to mitigate simplistic patterns of prior synthetic data. Despite reaching state-of-the-art performance, our experiments show that scaling SFT data eventually hits a plateau where further increases yield negligible improvements. Our MSRL method leverages a multi-granularity structured reward system using multimodal textual and visual feedback. At the textual level, rule-based rewards validate fine-grained code details. At the visual level, model-based rewards assess structural similarity by rendering generated code into images and employing an evaluator model. We implement this within a two-stage curriculum for training stability. Results demonstrate that MSRL significantly breaks the SFT plateau, improving high-level metrics by 6.2% and 9.9% on ChartMimic and ReachQA benchmarks respectively, achieving competitive performance with advanced closed-source models.</p></details> | technical report |

Two particularly popular approaches are reinforcement learning (RL) and supervised fine-tuning (SFT), but their training dynamics are poorly understood. We present a comparative analysis of RL and SFT on the same maths problems with the same model and similar hyperparameters. We find that RL yields minor in-domain gains on maths and slight degradation on knowledge-intensive benchmarks like MMLU, while both trends are more pronounced in SFT. We also analyse model parameters across checkpoints, observing that both algorithms modify query and key weights the most. Meanwhile, SFT exhibits greater updates and also affects mid-layer MLPs more, leading us to hypothesise that this may have caused the out-of-domain degradation. We therefore investigate whether freezing parts of the model during training can mitigate the reduced performance on knowledge-intensive benchmarks. However, our results are inconclusive, with benefits on GPQA:Diamond and degradation on other benchmarks. Taken together, our observations provide a preliminary indication for why RL amplifies existing capabilities, while SFT replaces old skills with new ones.</p></details> |  |
| **[OpenVLThinker: Complex Vision-Language Reasoning via Iterative SFT-RL Cycles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17352v2)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce OpenVLThinker, one of the first open-source large vision-language models (LVLMs) to exhibit sophisticated chain-of-thought reasoning, achieving notable performance gains on challenging visual reasoning tasks. While text-based reasoning models (e.g., Deepseek R1) show promising results in text-only tasks, distilling their reasoning into LVLMs via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) often results in performance degradation due to imprecise visual grounding. Conversely, purely reinforcement learning (RL)-based methods face a large search space, hindering the emergence of reflective behaviors in smaller models (e.g., 7B LVLMs). Surprisingly, alternating between SFT and RL ultimately results in significant performance improvements after a few iterations. Our analysis reveals that the base model rarely exhibits reasoning behaviors initially, but SFT effectively surfaces these latent actions and narrows the RL search space, accelerating the development of reasoning capabilities. Each subsequent RL stage further refines the model's reasoning skills, producing higher-quality SFT data for continued self-improvement. OpenVLThinker-7B consistently advances performance across six benchmarks demanding mathematical and general reasoning, notably improving MathVista by 3.8%, EMMA by 2.4%, and HallusionBench by 1.6%. Beyond demonstrating the synergy between SFT and RL for complex reasoning tasks, our findings provide early evidence towards achieving R1-style reasoning in multimodal contexts.

While Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) are the dominant training paradigms, a systematic methodology for combining them to maximize both accuracy and efficiency remains largely unexplored. This paper introduces a practical and effective training recipe that strategically integrates extended SFT with RL from online inference (GRPO). We posit that these methods play complementary, not competing, roles: a prolonged SFT phase first pushes the model's accuracy to its limits, after which a GRPO phase dramatically improves token efficiency while preserving this peak performance. Our experiments reveal that extending SFT for as many as 10 epochs is crucial for performance breakthroughs, and that the primary role of GRPO in this framework is to optimize solution length. The efficacy of our recipe is rigorously validated through top-tier performance on challenging benchmarks, including a high rank among over 2,200 teams in the strictly leak-free AI Mathematical Olympiad (AIMO). This work provides the community with a battle-tested blueprint for developing state-of-the-art mathematical reasoners that are both exceptionally accurate and practically efficient.

| **[The Synergy Dilemma of Long-CoT SFT and RL: Investigating Post-Training Techniques for Reasoning VLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07562v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large vision-language models (VLMs) increasingly adopt post-training techniques such as long chain-of-thought (CoT) supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) to elicit sophisticated reasoning. While these methods exhibit synergy in language-only models, their joint effectiveness in VLMs remains uncertain. We present a systematic investigation into the distinct roles and interplay of long-CoT SFT and RL across multiple multimodal reasoning benchmarks. We find that SFT improves performance on difficult questions by in-depth, structured reasoning, but introduces verbosity and degrades performance on simpler ones. In contrast, RL promotes generalization and brevity, yielding consistent improvements across all difficulty levels, though the improvements on the hardest questions are less prominent compared to SFT. Surprisingly, combining them through two-staged, interleaved, or progressive training strategies, as well as data mixing and model merging, all fails to produce additive benefits, instead leading to trade-offs in accuracy, reasoning style, and response length. This ``synergy dilemma'' highlights the need for more seamless and adaptive approaches to unlock the full potential of combined post-training techniques for reasoning VLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Implicit Reward as the Bridge: A Unified View of SFT and DPO Connections](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00018v2)** | 2025-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Post-training processes are essential phases in grounding pre-trained language models to real-world tasks, with learning from demonstrations or preference signals playing a crucial role in this adaptation. We present a unified theoretical framework bridging Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and preference learning in Large Language Model (LLM) post-training. Through rigorous mathematical derivation, we demonstrate that both SFT and preference learning methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) operate within the same optimal policy-reward subspace, with SFT representing a special case of implicit reward learning. Our analysis reveals a critical limitation in conventional SFT: the KL divergence term in distribution matching becomes constant with respect to the policy during optimization, failing to constrain model updates. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective learning rate reduction approach that yields significant performance improvements (up to \textbf{25\%} relative gain and \textbf{6\%} absolute win rate increase in instruction following tasks. Additionally, we derive alternative SFT objectives from various f-divergence functions that preserve the KL term during optimization, further enhancing post-DPO model performance. Finally, we extend the theoretical relationship between LLM logits and Q-functions from preference learning to the SFT context, providing mathematical derivations and experimental validation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bridging SFT and DPO for Diffusion Model Alignment with Self-Sampling Preference Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05255v2)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing post-training techniques are broadly categorized into supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) methods; the former is stable during training but suffers from limited generalization, while the latter, despite its stronger generalization capability, relies on additional preference data or reward models and carries the risk of reward exploitation. In order to preserve the advantages of both SFT and RL -- namely, eliminating the need for paired data and reward models while retaining the training stability of SFT and the generalization ability of RL -- a new alignment method, Self-Sampling Preference Optimization (SSPO), is proposed in this paper. SSPO introduces a Random Checkpoint Replay (RCR) strategy that utilizes historical checkpoints to construct paired data, thereby effectively mitigating overfitting. Simultaneously, a Self-Sampling Regularization (SSR) strategy is employed to dynamically evaluate the quality of generated samples; when the generated samples are more likely to be winning samples, the approach automatically switches from DPO (Direct Preference Optimization) to SFT, ensuring that the training process accurately reflects the quality of the samples. Experimental results demonstrate that SSPO not only outperforms existing methods on text-to-image benchmarks, but its effectiveness has also been validated in text-to-video tasks. We validate SSPO across both text-to-image and text-to-video benchmarks. SSPO surpasses all previous approaches on the text-to-image benchmarks and demonstrates outstanding performance on the text-to-video benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

However, existing approaches often fall short: methods solely employing reinforcement learning (RL) can struggle with sample inefficiency and activating entirely absent reasoning capabilities, while conventional pipelines that initiate with a cold-start supervised fine-tuning (SFT) phase before RL may restrict the model's exploratory capacity and face suboptimal convergence. In this work, we introduce \textbf{Metis-RISE} (\textbf{R}L \textbf{I}ncentivizes and \textbf{S}FT \textbf{E}nhances) for multimodal reasoning model learning. Unlike conventional approaches, Metis-RISE distinctively omits an initial SFT stage, beginning instead with an RL phase (e.g., using a Group Relative Policy Optimization variant) to incentivize and activate the model's latent reasoning capacity. Subsequently, the targeted SFT stage addresses two key challenges identified during RL: (1) \textit{inefficient trajectory sampling} for tasks where the model possesses but inconsistently applies correct reasoning, which we tackle using self-distilled reasoning trajectories from the RL model itself; and (2) \textit{fundamental capability absence}, which we address by injecting expert-augmented knowledge for prompts where the model entirely fails. This strategic application of RL for incentivization followed by SFT for enhancement forms the core of Metis-RISE, leading to two versions of our MLLMs (7B and 72B parameters). Evaluations on the OpenCompass Multimodal Reasoning Leaderboard demonstrate that both models achieve state-of-the-art performance among similar-sized models, with the 72B version ranking fourth overall.

The standard training approach combines a supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage, often to distill capabilities of a larger model, followed by a reinforcement learning (RL)stage such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). In this paper, we investigate the fundamental limitations of this SFT + RL paradigm and propose methods to overcome them. Under a suitable theoretical model, we demonstrate that the SFT + RL strategy can fail completely when (1) the expert's traces are too difficult for the small model to express, or (2) the small model's initialization has exponentially small likelihood of success. To address these, we introduce BREAD: a GRPO variant that unifies the SFT and RL stages via partial expert guidance and branched rollouts. When self-generated traces fail, BREAD adaptively inserts short expert prefixes/hints, allowing the small model to complete the rest of the reasoning path, and ensuring that each update includes at least one successful trace. This mechanism both densifies the reward signal and induces a natural learning curriculum. BREAD requires fewer than 40% of ground-truth traces, consistently outperforming standard GRPO while speeding up the training by about 3 times. Importantly, we demonstrate that BREAD helps the model solve problems that are otherwise unsolvable by the SFT + RL strategy, highlighting how branched rollouts and expert guidance can substantially boost SLM reasoning.</p></details> |  |

We begin by curating the SFT training data through two scaling strategies: increasing the number of collected prompts and the number of generated responses per prompt. Both approaches yield notable improvements in reasoning performance, with scaling the number of prompts resulting in more substantial gains. We then explore the following questions regarding the synergy between SFT and RL: (i) Does a stronger SFT model consistently lead to better final performance after large-scale RL training? (ii) How can we determine an appropriate sampling temperature during RL training to effectively balance exploration and exploitation for a given SFT initialization? Our findings suggest that (i) holds true, provided effective RL training is conducted, particularly when the sampling temperature is carefully chosen to maintain the temperature-adjusted entropy around 0.3, a setting that strikes a good balance between exploration and exploitation. Notably, the performance gap between initial SFT models narrows significantly throughout the RL process. Leveraging a strong SFT foundation and insights into the synergistic interplay between SFT and RL, our AceReason-Nemotron-1.1 7B model significantly outperforms AceReason-Nemotron-1.0 and achieves new state-of-the-art performance among Qwen2.5-7B-based reasoning models on challenging math and code benchmarks, thereby demonstrating the effectiveness of our post-training recipe.

Exploring the Interplay of SFT and RL in Enhancing LLM Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24273v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs) have effectively improved their reasoning abilities, particularly on mathematical and logical problems that have verifiable answers, through techniques such as supervised finetuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL). Prior research indicates that RL effectively internalizes search strategies, enabling long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, with backtracking emerging naturally as a learned capability. However, the precise benefits of backtracking, specifically, how significantly it contributes to reasoning improvements and the optimal extent of its use, remain poorly understood. In this work, we systematically investigate the dynamics between SFT and RL on eight reasoning tasks: Countdown, Sudoku, Arc 1D, Geometry, Color Cube Rotation, List Functions, Zebra Puzzles, and Self Reference. Our findings highlight that short CoT sequences used in SFT as a warm-up do have moderate contribution to RL training, compared with cold-start RL; however such contribution diminishes when tasks become increasingly difficult. Motivated by this observation, we construct synthetic datasets varying systematically in the number of backtracking steps and conduct controlled experiments to isolate the influence of either the correctness (content) or the structure (i.e., backtrack frequency). We find that (1) longer CoT with backtracks generally induce better and more stable RL training, (2) more challenging problems with larger search space tend to need higher numbers of backtracks during the SFT stage. Additionally, we demonstrate through experiments on distilled data that RL training is largely unaffected by the correctness of long CoT sequences, suggesting that RL prioritizes structural patterns over content correctness. Collectively, our results offer practical insights into designing optimal training strategies to effectively scale reasoning in LLMs.</p></details> |  |

However, their roles in enhancing model generalization capabilities remain unclear. This paper studies the difference between SFT and RL on generalization and memorization, focusing on text-based rule variants and visual variants. We introduce GeneralPoints, an arithmetic reasoning card game, and adopt V-IRL, a real-world navigation environment, to assess how models trained with SFT and RL generalize to unseen variants in both textual and visual domains. We show that RL, especially when trained with an outcome-based reward, generalizes across both rule-based textual and visual variants. SFT, in contrast, tends to memorize training data and struggles to generalize out-of-distribution scenarios. Further analysis reveals that RL improves the model's underlying visual recognition capabilities, contributing to its enhanced generalization in the visual domain. Despite RL's superior generalization, we show that SFT remains essential for effective RL training; SFT stabilizes the model's output format, enabling subsequent RL to achieve its performance gains.

In this work, we propose SOAEsV2-7B/72B, a specialized LLM series developed via a three-phase framework: 1) continual pre-training integrates domain knowledge while retaining base capabilities; 2) domain-progressive SFT employs curriculum-based learning strategy, transitioning from weakly relevant conversational data to expert-annotated SOAEs datasets to optimize domain-specific tasks; 3) distillation-enhanced speculative decoding accelerates inference via logit distillation between 72B target and 7B draft models, achieving 1.39-1.52$\times$ speedup without quality loss. Experimental results demonstrate that our domain-specific pre-training phase maintains 99.8% of original general language capabilities while significantly improving domain performance, resulting in a 1.08$\times$ improvement in Rouge-1 score and a 1.17$\times$ enhancement in BLEU-4 score. Ablation studies further show that domain-progressive SFT outperforms single-stage training, achieving 1.02$\times$ improvement in Rouge-1 and 1.06$\times$ in BLEU-4. Our work introduces a comprehensive, full-pipeline approach for optimizing SOAEs LLMs, bridging the gap between general language capabilities and domain-specific expertise.</p></details> |  |

With the rapid scaling of Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly through reinforcement learning (RL), there is a growing need for more capable discriminators. Consequently, advances in classification are becoming increasingly vital for enhancing the overall capabilities of LLMs. Traditional discriminative methods map text to labels but overlook LLMs' intrinsic generative strengths. Generative classification addresses this by prompting the model to directly output labels. However, existing studies still rely on simple SFT alone, seldom probing the interplay between training and inference prompts, and no work has systematically leveraged RL for generative text classifiers and unified SFT, RL, and inference-time prompting in one framework. We bridge this gap with GenCLS++, a framework that jointly optimizes SFT and RL while systematically exploring five high-level strategy dimensions-in-context learning variants, category definitions, explicit uncertainty labels, semantically irrelevant numeric labels, and perplexity-based decoding-during both training and inference. After an SFT "policy warm-up," we apply RL with a simple rule-based reward, yielding sizable extra gains. Across seven datasets, GenCLS++ achieves an average accuracy improvement of 3.46% relative to the naive SFT baseline; on public datasets, this improvement rises to 4.00%. Notably, unlike reasoning-intensive tasks that benefit from explicit thinking processes, we find that classification tasks perform better without such reasoning steps. These insights into the role of explicit reasoning provide valuable guidance for future LLM applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Climbing the Ladder of Reasoning: What LLMs Can-and Still Can't-Solve after SFT?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11741v1)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent supervised fine-tuning (SFT) approaches have significantly improved language models' performance on mathematical reasoning tasks, even when models are trained at a small scale. However, the specific capabilities enhanced through such fine-tuning remain poorly understood. In this paper, we conduct a detailed analysis of model performance on the AIME24 dataset to understand how reasoning capabilities evolve. We discover a ladder-like structure in problem difficulty, categorize questions into four tiers (Easy, Medium, Hard, and Extremely Hard (Exh)), and identify the specific requirements for advancing between tiers. We find that progression from Easy to Medium tier requires adopting an R1 reasoning style with minimal SFT (500-1K instances), while Hard-level questions suffer from frequent model's errors at each step of the reasoning chain, with accuracy plateauing at around 65% despite logarithmic scaling. Exh-level questions present a fundamentally different challenge; they require unconventional problem-solving skills that current models uniformly struggle with. Additional findings reveal that carefully curated small-scale datasets offer limited advantage-scaling dataset size proves far more effective. Our analysis provides a clearer roadmap for advancing language model capabilities in mathematical reasoning.</p></details> |  |

Through careful exploration of training and inference optimization, we demonstrate that: 1) with only 0.5B parameters, our model can generate 1024x1024 resolution images with high fidelity, and achieve competitive results on challenging text-to-image benchmarks, e.g., 0.59 on GenEval and 79.66 on DPG; 2) both supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) training could lead to significant improvements on generation aesthectics and prompt alignment; and 3) when optimized with inference acceleraton techniques like vLLM, the time for SimpleAR to generate an 1024x1024 image could be reduced to around 14 seconds. By sharing these findings and open-sourcing the code, we hope to reveal the potential of autoregressive visual generation and encourage more participation in this research field.

| **[SFT or RL? An Early Investigation into Training R1-Like Reasoning Large Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11468v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work revisits the dominant supervised fine-tuning (SFT) then reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm for training Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), and reveals a key finding: SFT can significantly undermine subsequent RL by inducing ``pseudo reasoning paths'' imitated from expert models. While these paths may resemble the native reasoning paths of RL models, they often involve prolonged, hesitant, less informative steps, and incorrect reasoning. To systematically study this effect, we introduce VLAA-Thinking, a new multimodal dataset designed to support reasoning in LVLMs. Constructed via a six-step pipeline involving captioning, reasoning distillation, answer rewrite and verification, VLAA-Thinking comprises high-quality, step-by-step visual reasoning traces for SFT, along with a more challenging RL split from the same data source. Using this dataset, we conduct extensive experiments comparing SFT, RL and their combinations. Results show that while SFT helps models learn reasoning formats, it often locks aligned models into imitative, rigid reasoning modes that impede further learning. In contrast, building on the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a novel mixed reward module integrating both perception and cognition signals, our RL approach fosters more genuine, adaptive reasoning behavior. Notably, our model VLAA-Thinker, based on Qwen2.5VL 3B, achieves top-1 performance on Open LMM Reasoning Leaderboard (https://huggingface.co/spaces/opencompass/Open_LMM_Reasoning_Leaderboard) among 4B scale LVLMs, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art by 1.8%. We hope our findings provide valuable insights in developing reasoning-capable LVLMs and can inform future research in this area.</p></details> |  |

However, to enhance its utility and reduce potential harm, SFT and alignment are applied sequentially to the pretrained model. Due to the differing nature and objective functions of SFT and alignment, catastrophic forgetting has become a significant issue. To address this, we introduce Unified Fine-Tuning (UFT), which integrates SFT and alignment into a single training stage using the same objective and loss functions through an implicit reward function. Our experimental results demonstrate that UFT outperforms SFT on instruction-tuning data alone. Moreover, when combining instruction-tuning data with alignment data, UFT effectively prevents catastrophic forgetting across these two stages and shows a clear advantage over sequentially applying SFT and alignment. This is evident in the significant improvements observed in the \textbf{ifeval} task for instruction-following and the \textbf{truthful-qa} task for factuality. The proposed general fine-tuning framework UFT establishes an effective and efficient pretraining-UFT paradigm for LLM training.</p></details> |  |
| **[TEMPLE:Temporal Preference Learning of Video LLMs via Difficulty Scheduling and Pre-SFT Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16929v2)** | 2025-03-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Large Language Models (Video LLMs) have achieved significant success by leveraging a two-stage paradigm: pretraining on large-scale video-text data for vision-language alignment, followed by supervised fine-tuning (SFT) for task-specific capabilities. However, existing approaches struggle with temporal reasoning due to weak temporal correspondence in the data and reliance on the next-token prediction paradigm during training. To address these limitations, we propose TEMPLE (TEMporal Preference Learning), a systematic framework that enhances Video LLMs' temporal reasoning capabilities through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). To facilitate this, we introduce an automated preference data generation pipeline that systematically constructs preference pairs by selecting videos that are rich in temporal information, designing video-specific perturbation strategies, and finally evaluating model responses on clean and perturbed video inputs. Our temporal alignment features two key innovations: curriculum learning which that progressively increases perturbation difficulty to improve model robustness and adaptability; and "Pre-SFT Alignment'', applying preference optimization before instruction tuning to prioritize fine-grained temporal comprehension. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently improves Video LLM performance across multiple benchmarks with a relatively small set of self-generated DPO data. We further analyze the transferability of DPO data across architectures and the role of difficulty scheduling in optimization. Our findings highlight our TEMPLE as a scalable and efficient complement to SFT-based methods, paving the way for developing reliable Video LLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/lscpku/TEMPLE.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bring Remote Sensing Object Detect Into Nature Language Model: Using SFT Method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08144v2)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved significant success, demonstrating remarkable capabilities in understanding various images and videos, particularly in classification and detection tasks. However, due to the substantial differences between remote sensing images and conventional optical images, these models face considerable challenges in comprehension, especially in detection tasks. Directly prompting VLMs with detection instructions often leads to unsatisfactory results. To address this issue, this letter explores the application of VLMs for object detection in remote sensing images. Specifically, we constructed supervised fine-tuning (SFT) datasets using publicly available remote sensing object detection datasets, including SSDD, HRSID, and NWPU-VHR-10. In these new datasets, we converted annotation information into JSON-compliant natural language descriptions, facilitating more effective understanding and training for the VLM. We then evaluate the detection performance of various fine-tuning strategies for VLMs and derive optimized model weights for object detection in remote sensing images. Finally, we evaluate the model's prior knowledge capabilities using natural language queries. Experimental results demonstrate that, without modifying the model architecture, remote sensing object detection can be effectively achieved using natural language alone. Additionally, the model exhibits the ability to perform certain vision question answering (VQA) tasks. Our datasets and related code will be released soon.</p></details> |  |
| **[R1-Zero's "Aha Moment" in Visual Reasoning on a 2B Non-SFT Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05132v2)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently DeepSeek R1 demonstrated how reinforcement learning with simple rule-based incentives can enable autonomous development of complex reasoning in large language models, characterized by the "aha moment", in which the model manifest self-reflection and increased response length during training. However, attempts to extend this success to multimodal reasoning often failed to reproduce these key characteristics. In this report, we present the first successful replication of these emergent characteristics for multimodal reasoning on only a non-SFT 2B model. Starting with Qwen2-VL-2B and applying reinforcement learning directly on the SAT dataset, our model achieves 59.47% accuracy on CVBench, outperforming the base model by approximately ~30% and exceeding both SFT setting by ~2%. In addition, we share our failed attempts and insights in attempting to achieve R1-like reasoning using RL with instruct models. aiming to shed light on the challenges involved. Our key observations include: (1) applying RL on instruct model often results in trivial reasoning trajectories, and (2) naive length reward are ineffective in eliciting reasoning capabilities.

However, RLHF has been continuously challenged by its high complexity in implementation and computation consumption. Even with recent simplifications, such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Advantage Leftover Lunch (A-LoL), the problems of over-fitting and training instability remain hindering the alignment process from the expected optimal performance. To address the existing challenges, we propose a novel simplification of RLHF from the perspective of variational inference, called $\textbf{V}$ariational $\textbf{A}$lignment with $\textbf{R}$e-weighting ($\textbf{VAR}$). More specifically, by directly minimizing the distribution gap between the learning LLM policy and the optimal solution of RLHF, we transform the alignment objective into a reward-driven re-weighted supervised fine-tuning (SFT) form, which only requires minor adjustment on the SFT loss to obtain noticeable improvement on training stability and effectiveness. On comprehensive alignment and generation benchmarks, our VAR method has numerically achieved competitive performance in LLM alignment helpfulness and harmlessness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Provably Mitigating Overoptimization in RLHF: Your SFT Loss is Implicitly an Adversarial Regularizer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16436v3)** | 2024-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aligning generative models with human preference via RLHF typically suffers from overoptimization, where an imperfectly learned reward model can misguide the generative model to output undesired responses. We investigate this problem in a principled manner by identifying the source of the misalignment as a form of distributional shift and uncertainty in learning human preferences. To mitigate overoptimization, we first propose a theoretical algorithm that chooses the best policy for an adversarially chosen reward model; one that simultaneously minimizes the maximum likelihood estimation of the loss and a reward penalty term. Here, the reward penalty term is introduced to prevent the policy from choosing actions with spurious high proxy rewards, resulting in provable sample efficiency of the algorithm under a partial coverage style condition. Moving from theory to practice, the proposed algorithm further enjoys an equivalent but surprisingly easy-to-implement reformulation. Using the equivalence between reward models and the corresponding optimal policy, the algorithm features a simple objective that combines: (i) a preference optimization loss that directly aligns the policy with human preference, and (ii) a supervised learning loss that explicitly imitates the policy with a (suitable) baseline distribution. In the context of aligning large language models (LLM), this objective fuses the direct preference optimization (DPO) loss with the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) loss to help mitigate the overoptimization towards undesired responses, for which we name the algorithm Regularized Preference Optimization (RPO). Experiments of aligning LLMs demonstrate the improved performance of RPO compared with DPO baselines. Our work sheds light on the interplay between preference optimization and SFT in tuning LLMs with both theoretical guarantees and empirical evidence.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by The Thirty-Eighth Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems. 31 pages, 7 figures</p></details> |
| **[Continual SFT Matches Multimodal RLHF with Negative Supervision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14797v1)** | 2024-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal RLHF usually happens after supervised finetuning (SFT) stage to continually improve vision-language models' (VLMs) comprehension. Conventional wisdom holds its superiority over continual SFT during this preference alignment stage. In this paper, we observe that the inherent value of multimodal RLHF lies in its negative supervision, the logit of the rejected responses. We thus propose a novel negative supervised finetuning (nSFT) approach that fully excavates these information resided. Our nSFT disentangles this negative supervision in RLHF paradigm, and continually aligns VLMs with a simple SFT loss. This is more memory efficient than multimodal RLHF where 2 (e.g., DPO) or 4 (e.g., PPO) large VLMs are strictly required. The effectiveness of nSFT is rigorously proved by comparing it with various multimodal RLHF approaches, across different dataset sources, base VLMs and evaluation metrics. Besides, fruitful of ablations are provided to support our hypothesis. We hope this paper will stimulate further research to properly align large vision language models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Getting More Juice Out of the SFT Data: Reward Learning from Human Demonstration Improves SFT for LLM Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17888v3)** | 2024-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aligning human preference and value is an important requirement for contemporary foundation models. State-of-the-art techniques such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) often consist of two stages: 1) supervised fine-tuning (SFT), where the model is fine-tuned by learning from human demonstration data; 2) Preference learning, where preference data is used to learn a reward model, which is in turn used by a reinforcement learning (RL) step to fine-tune the model. Such reward model serves as a proxy to human preference, and it is critical to guide the RL step towards improving the model quality. In this work, we argue that the SFT stage significantly benefits from learning a reward model as well. Instead of using the human demonstration data directly via supervised learning, we propose to leverage an Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) technique to simultaneously build an reward model and a policy model. This approach leads to new SFT algorithms that are not only efficient to implement, but are robust to the presence of low-quality supervised learning data. Moreover, we discover a connection between the proposed IRL based approach, and a recent line of works called Self-Play Fine-tune (SPIN). Theoretically, we show that the proposed algorithms converge to the stationary solutions of the IRL problem. Empirically, we align 1B and 7B models using proposed methods and evaluate them on a reward benchmark model and the HuggingFace Open LLM Leaderboard. The proposed methods show significant performance improvement over existing SFT approaches. Our results indicate that it is beneficial to leverage reward learning throughout the entire alignment process.</p></details> |  |

The paradigm contains supervised fine tuning and reinforce learning from human feedback. This paradigm is also used in downstream scenarios to adapt LLM to specific corpora and applications. Comparing to SFT, there are many efforts focused on RLHF and several algorithms being proposed, such as PPO, DPO, IPO, KTO, MinorDPO and etc. Meanwhile most efforts for SFT are focused on how to collect, filter and mix high quality data. In this article with insight from DPO and MinorDPO, we propose a training metric for SFT to measure the discrepancy between the optimized model and the original model, and a loss function MinorSFT that can increase the training effectiveness, and reduce the discrepancy between the optimized LLM and original LLM.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |

However, sourcing this data through human annotation is costly, and existing automated methods often fail to capture the diverse range of contextual granularity and tend to produce homogeneous data. To tackle these issues, we introduce a novel method named AugCon, capable of automatically generating context-driven SFT data across multiple levels of granularity with high diversity, quality and fidelity. AugCon begins by generating queries using the Context-Split-Tree (CST), an innovative approach for recursively deriving queries and splitting context to cover full granularity. Then, we train a scorer through contrastive learning to collaborate with CST to rank and refine queries. Finally, a synergistic integration of self-alignment and self-improving is introduced to obtain high-fidelity responses. Extensive experiments are conducted incorporating both human and automatic evaluations, encompassing a test scenario and four widely-used benchmarks in English and Chinese. The results highlight the significant advantages of AugCon in producing high diversity, quality, and fidelity SFT data against several state-of-the-art methods. All of our code, dataset, and fine-tuned model will be available at: https://github.com/quanshr/AugCon.</p></details> |  |

It typically consists of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) stages. However, RLHF faces inherent limitations stemming from a complex training setup and its tendency to align the model with implicit values that end users cannot control at run-time. Moreover, reward models in RLHF stage commonly rely on single-dimensional feedback as opposed to explicit, multifaceted signals that indicate attributes such as helpfulness, humor, and toxicity. To address these limitations, we propose SteerLM, a supervised fine-tuning method that empowers end-users to control responses during inference. SteerLM conditions responses to conform to an explicitly defined multi-dimensional set of attributes, thereby empowering a steerable AI capable of generating helpful and high-quality responses while maintaining customizability. Experiments show that SteerLM trained on open source datasets generates responses that are preferred by human and automatic evaluators to many state-of-the-art baselines trained with RLHF while being much easier to train.

However, as the number of cascades increases, the improvements in reconstruction tend to become marginal, indicating possible excess model capacity. Knowledge distillation (KD) is an emerging technique to compress these models, in which a trained deep teacher network is used to distill knowledge to a smaller student network such that the student learns to mimic the behavior of the teacher. Most KD methods focus on effectively training the student with a pre-trained teacher unaware of the student model. We propose SFT-KD-Recon, a student-friendly teacher training approach along with the student as a prior step to KD to make the teacher aware of the structure and capacity of the student and enable aligning the representations of the teacher with the student. In SFT, the teacher is jointly trained with the unfolded branch configurations of the student blocks using three loss terms - teacher-reconstruction loss, student-reconstruction loss, and teacher-student imitation loss, followed by KD of the student. We perform extensive experiments for MRI acceleration in 4x and 5x under-sampling on the brain and cardiac datasets on five KD methods using the proposed approach as a prior step. We consider the DC-CNN architecture and setup teacher as D5C5 (141765 parameters), and student as D3C5 (49285 parameters), denoting a compression of 2.87:1. Results show that (i) our approach consistently improves the KD methods with improved reconstruction performance and image quality, and (ii) the student distilled using our approach is competitive with the teacher, with the performance gap reduced from 0.53 dB to 0.03 dB.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 8 figures.

In particular we prove that all generalized Baumslag-Solitar groups (GBS) admit a strongly aperiodic SFT. Our proof is based on a structural theorem by Whyte and on two constructions of strongly aperiodic SFTs on $\mathbb{F}_n\times \mathbb{Z}$ and $BS(m,n)$ of our own. Our two constructions rely on a path-folding technique that lifts an SFT on $\mathbb{Z}^2$ inside an SFT on $\mathbb{F}_n\times \mathbb{Z}$ or an SFT on the hyperbolic plane inside an SFT on $BS(m,n)$. In the case of $\mathbb{F}_n\times \mathbb{Z}$ the path folding technique also preserves minimality, so that we get minimal strongly aperiodic SFTs on unimodular GBS groups.</p></details> | 31 pages, 13 figures |

As a consequence, if $P$ contains a recursive member, $P$ and $X$ have the exact same set of Turing degrees. On the other hand, we prove that if $X$ contains only non-recursive members, some of its members always have different but comparable degrees.

However, existing reward models lack this ability, as they are typically trained by increasing the reward gap between chosen and rejected responses, while overlooking the prompts that the responses are conditioned on. Consequently, when the trained reward model is evaluated on prompt-response pairs that lie outside the data distribution, neglecting the effect of prompts may result in poor generalization of the reward model. To address this issue, we decompose the reward value into two independent components: prompt-free reward and prompt-related reward. Prompt-free reward represents the evaluation that is determined only by responses, while the prompt-related reward reflects the reward that derives from both the prompt and the response. We extract these two components from an information-theoretic perspective, which requires no extra models. Subsequently, we propose a new reward learning algorithm by prioritizing data samples based on their prompt-free reward values. Through toy examples, we demonstrate that the extracted prompt-free and prompt-related rewards effectively characterize two parts of the reward model. Further, standard evaluations show that our method improves both the alignment performance and the generalization capability of the reward model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Work ...</summary><p>Work done during internships at Institute of Artificial Intelligence (TeleAI), China Telecom</p></details> |

Incorporating multiple reference models has the potential to address these limitations by broadening perspectives, reducing bias, and leveraging the strengths of diverse open-source LLMs. However, integrating multiple reference models into reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) frameworks poses significant theoretical challenges, where achieving exact solutions has remained an open problem. This paper presents the first \emph{exact solution} to the multiple reference model problem in reverse KL-regularized RLHF. We introduce a comprehensive theoretical framework that includes rigorous statistical analysis and provides sample complexity guarantees. Additionally, we extend our analysis to forward KL-regularized RLHF, offering new insights into sample complexity requirements in multiple reference scenarios. Our contributions lay the foundation for more advanced and adaptable LLM alignment techniques, enabling the effective use of multiple reference models. This work paves the way for developing alignment frameworks that are both theoretically sound and better suited to the challenges of modern AI ecosystems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Extra...</summary><p>Extra experiments are added in new version</p></details> |
| **[KL-regularization Itself is Differentially Private in Bandits and RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18407v2)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differential Privacy (DP) provides a rigorous framework for privacy, ensuring the outputs of data-driven algorithms remain statistically indistinguishable across datasets that differ in a single entry. While guaranteeing DP generally requires explicitly injecting noise either to the algorithm itself or to its outputs, the intrinsic randomness of existing algorithms presents an opportunity to achieve DP ``for free''. In this work, we explore the role of regularization in achieving DP across three different decision-making problems: multi-armed bandits, linear contextual bandits, and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), in offline data settings. We show that adding KL-regularization to the learning objective (a common approach in optimization algorithms) makes the action sampled from the resulting stochastic policy itself differentially private. This offers a new route to privacy guarantees without additional noise injection, while also preserving the inherent advantage of regularization in enhancing performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Information-Theoretic Reward Modeling for Stable RLHF: Detecting and Mitigating Reward Hacking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13694v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the success of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) in aligning language models with human values, reward hacking-or reward over-optimization-remains a major challenge. We identify two key obstacles to its mitigation: (1) reward misgeneralization in reward modeling, where reward models overfit to spurious, preference-irrelevant features; and (2) the lack of suitable regularization during RL optimization, as existing token-level constraints often over-restrict the policy space. To address these issues, we propose InfoRM, an information-theoretic reward modeling framework based on the Information Bottleneck (IB) principle, which filters out preference-irrelevant information to alleviate reward misgeneralization. We further observe that reward-hacked responses manifest as pronounced outliers in InfoRM's IB latent space, measured by Mahalanobis distance from the SFT-induced distribution. Motivated by this, we introduce IBL, a distribution-level regularization that penalizes such deviations, effectively expanding the optimization landscape while maintaining alignment. We prove that IBL is theoretically equivalent to the pessimistic RL objective within the IB latent space. Finally, we present Mahalanobis Outlier Probability (MOP), a statistical metric for quantifying reward hacking severity, enabling principled hyperparameter tuning and online mitigation such as early stopping. Extensive experiments across diverse LLMs and datasets confirm the generality of our findings, the effectiveness of InfoRM and IBL, and the reliability of MOP as a diagnostic tool-collectively advancing the state of RLHF.</p></details> | <details><summary>46 pa...</summary><p>46 pages, 36 figures, submitted to IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence</p></details> |
| **[Offline and Online KL-Regularized RLHF under Differential Privacy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13512v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we study the offline and online settings of reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) with KL-regularization -- a widely used objective function in large language model alignment -- under the $\epsilon$ local differential privacy ($\epsilon$-LDP) model on the label of the human preference. In the offline setting, we design an algorithm based on the principle of pessimism and derive a new suboptimality gap of $\tilde{O}(1/[(e^\epsilon-1)^2 n])$ on the KL-regularized objective under single-policy concentrability. We also prove its optimality by providing a matching lower bound where $n$ is the sample size. In the online setting, we are the first one to theoretically investigate the problem of KL-regularized RLHF with LDP. We design an optimism-based algorithm and derive a logarithmic regret bound of $O(d_{\mathcal{F}}\log (N_{\mathcal{F}}\cdot T) /(e^\epsilon-1)^2 )$, where $T$ is the total time step, $N_{\mathcal{F}}$ is cardinality of the reward function space $\mathcal{F}$ and $d_{\mathcal{F}}$ is a variant of eluder dimension for RLHF. As a by-product of our analysis, our results also imply the first analysis for online KL-regularized RLHF without privacy. We implement our algorithm in the offline setting to verify our theoretical results and release our open source code at: https://github.com/rushil-thareja/PPKL-RLHF-Official.</p></details> |  |
| **[General Exploratory Bonus for Optimistic Exploration in RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03269v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optimistic exploration is central to improving sample efficiency in reinforcement learning with human feedback, yet existing exploratory bonus methods to incentivize exploration often fail to realize optimism. We provide a theoretical analysis showing that current formulations, under KL or $\alpha$-divergence regularization, unintentionally bias exploration toward high-probability regions of the reference model, thereby reinforcing conservative behavior instead of promoting discovery of uncertain regions. To address this pitfall, we introduce the General Exploratory Bonus (GEB), a novel theoretical framework that provably satisfies the optimism principle. GEB counteracts divergence-induced bias via reference-dependent reward regulation and unifies prior heuristic bonuses as special cases, while extending naturally across the full $\alpha$-divergence family. Empirically, GEB consistently outperforms baselines on alignment tasks across multiple divergence settings and large language model backbones. These results demonstrate that GEB offers both a principled and practical solution for optimistic exploration in RLHF.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Hidden Link Between RLHF and Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22578v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human values has recently garnered significant attention, with prominent examples including the canonical yet costly Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and the simple Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). In this work, we demonstrate that both RLHF and DPO can be interpreted from the perspective of mutual information (MI) maximization, uncovering a profound connection to contrastive learning. Within this framework, both RLHF and DPO can be interpreted as methods that performing contrastive learning based on the positive and negative samples derived from base model, leveraging the Donsker-Varadhan (DV) lower bound on MI (equivalently, the MINE estimator). Such paradigm further illuminates why RLHF may not intrinsically incentivize reasoning capacities in LLMs beyond what is already present in the base model. Building on the perspective, we replace the DV/MINE bound with the Jensen-Shannon (JS) MI estimator and propose the Mutual Information Optimization (MIO). Comprehensive theoretical analysis and extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that MIO mitigates the late-stage decline in chosen-likelihood observed in DPO, achieving competitive or superior performance across various challenging reasoning and mathematical benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Understanding Sampler Stochasticity in Training Diffusion Models for RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10767v1)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is increasingly used to fine-tune diffusion models, but a key challenge arises from the mismatch between stochastic samplers used during training and deterministic samplers used during inference. In practice, models are fine-tuned using stochastic SDE samplers to encourage exploration, while inference typically relies on deterministic ODE samplers for efficiency and stability. This discrepancy induces a reward gap, raising concerns about whether high-quality outputs can be expected during inference. In this paper, we theoretically characterize this reward gap and provide non-vacuous bounds for general diffusion models, along with sharper convergence rates for Variance Exploding (VE) and Variance Preserving (VP) Gaussian models. Methodologically, we adopt the generalized denoising diffusion implicit models (gDDIM) framework to support arbitrarily high levels of stochasticity, preserving data marginals throughout. Empirically, our findings through large-scale experiments on text-to-image models using denoising diffusion policy optimization (DDPO) and mixed group relative policy optimization (MixGRPO) validate that reward gaps consistently narrow over training, and ODE sampling quality improves when models are updated using higher-stochasticity SDE training.</p></details> |  |
| **[GREAT: Generalizable Backdoor Attacks in RLHF via Emotion-Aware Trigger Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09260v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent work has shown that RLHF is highly susceptible to backdoor attacks, poisoning schemes that inject malicious triggers in preference data. However, existing methods often rely on static, rare-token-based triggers, limiting their effectiveness in realistic scenarios. In this paper, we develop GREAT, a novel framework for crafting generalizable backdoors in RLHF through emotion-aware trigger synthesis. Specifically, GREAT targets harmful response generation for a vulnerable user subgroup characterized by both semantically violent requests and emotionally angry triggers. At the core of GREAT is a trigger identification pipeline that operates in the latent embedding space, leveraging principal component analysis and clustering techniques to identify the most representative triggers. To enable this, we present Erinyes, a high-quality dataset of over $5000$ angry triggers curated from GPT-4.1 using a principled, hierarchical, and diversity-promoting approach. Experiments on benchmark RLHF datasets demonstrate that GREAT significantly outperforms baseline methods in attack success rates, especially for unseen trigger scenarios, while largely preserving the response quality on benign inputs.</p></details> |  |
| **[OpenRLHF: An Easy-to-use, Scalable and High-performance RLHF Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11143v6)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) fine-tuned via Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) significantly improve the alignment of human-AI values, further raising the upper bound of AI capabilities, particularly in reasoning-intensive, long-context Chain-of-Thought (CoT) tasks. However, existing frameworks commonly face challenges such as inference bottlenecks and complexity barriers, which restrict their accessibility to newcomers. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{OpenRLHF}, a user-friendly, scalable, and easy-to-learn open-source RLHF framework built upon Ray, vLLM, DeepSpeed, and HuggingFace Transformers, featuring a simplified design, clear code structure, and comprehensive documentation to facilitate entry for researchers and practitioners. Experimental results show that OpenRLHF achieves superior training efficiency, with speedups ranging from 1.22x to 1.68x across different model sizes, compared to state-of-the-art frameworks. Additionally, it requires significantly fewer lines of code for implementation. OpenRLHF is publicly available at https://github.com/OpenRLHF/OpenRLHF, and has already been adopted by leading institutions to accelerate RLHF research and learning.</p></details> | update template |

While current DNA foundation models excel at representing sequences, they struggle with multi-step reasoning and lack transparent, biologically meaningful explanations. BioReason addresses this by tightly integrating a DNA foundation model with a large language model (LLM), enabling the LLM to directly interpret and reason over genomic information. Through supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, BioReason learns to produce logical, biologically coherent deductions. It achieves major performance gains, boosting KEGG-based disease pathway prediction accuracy from 86% to 98% and improving variant effect prediction by an average of 15% over strong baselines. BioReason can reason over unseen biological entities and explain its decisions step by step, offering a transformative framework for interpretable, mechanistic AI in biology.

However, existing methods of task-aware distillation typically require substantial quantities of data which may be unavailable or expensive to obtain in many practical scenarios. In this paper, we address this challenge by introducing a novel strategy called Counterfactual-explanation-infused Distillation CoD for few-shot task-aware knowledge distillation by systematically infusing counterfactual explanations. Counterfactual explanations (CFEs) refer to inputs that can flip the output prediction of the teacher model with minimum perturbation. Our strategy CoD leverages these CFEs to precisely map the teacher's decision boundary with significantly fewer samples. We provide theoretical guarantees for motivating the role of CFEs in distillation, from both statistical and geometric perspectives. We mathematically show that CFEs can improve parameter estimation by providing more informative examples near the teacher's decision boundary. We also derive geometric insights on how CFEs effectively act as knowledge probes, helping the students mimic the teacher's decision boundaries more effectively than standard data. We perform experiments across various datasets and LLMs to show that CoD outperforms standard distillation approaches in few-shot regimes (as low as 8-512 samples). Notably, CoD only uses half of the original samples used by the baselines, paired with their corresponding CFEs and still improves performance.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |

However, dense retrievers often become the bottleneck of RAG systems due to their limited parameters compared to LLMs and their inability to perform step-by-step reasoning. While prompt-based iterative RAG attempts to address these limitations, it is constrained by human-designed workflows. To address these limitations, we propose $\textbf{R3-RAG}$, which uses $\textbf{R}$einforcement learning to make the LLM learn how to $\textbf{R}$eason and $\textbf{R}$etrieve step by step, thus retrieving comprehensive external knowledge and leading to correct answers. R3-RAG is divided into two stages. We first use cold start to make the model learn the manner of iteratively interleaving reasoning and retrieval. Then we use reinforcement learning to further harness its ability to better explore the external retrieval environment. Specifically, we propose two rewards for R3-RAG: 1) answer correctness for outcome reward, which judges whether the trajectory leads to a correct answer; 2) relevance-based document verification for process reward, encouraging the model to retrieve documents that are relevant to the user question, through which we can let the model learn how to iteratively reason and retrieve relevant documents to get the correct answer. Experimental results show that R3-RAG significantly outperforms baselines and can transfer well to different retrievers. We release R3-RAG at https://github.com/Yuan-Li-FNLP/R3-RAG.</p></details> |  |

LLM alignment algorithms rely on static preference datasets, assuming that they accurately represent real-world user preferences. However, user preferences vary significantly across geographical regions, demographics, linguistic patterns, and evolving cultural trends. This preference distribution shift leads to catastrophic alignment failures in many real-world applications. We address this problem using the principled framework of distributionally robust optimization, and develop two novel distributionally robust direct preference optimization (DPO) algorithms, namely, Wasserstein DPO (WDPO) and Kullback-Leibler DPO (KLDPO). We characterize the sample complexity of learning the optimal policy parameters for WDPO and KLDPO. Moreover, we propose scalable gradient descent-style learning algorithms by developing suitable approximations for the challenging minimax loss functions of WDPO and KLDPO. Our empirical experiments using benchmark data sets and LLMs demonstrate the superior performance of WDPO and KLDPO in substantially improving the alignment when there is a preference distribution shift.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

However, there have been concerns regarding the quality and reliability of the generated text, one of which is the citation accuracy and faithfulness. While most recent work relies on methods such as LLM-as-a-Judge, the reliability of LLM-as-a-Judge alone is also in doubt. In this work, we reframe citation evaluation as a problem of citation attribution alignment, which is assessing whether LLM-generated citations match those a human author would include for the same text. We propose CiteGuard, a retrieval-aware agent framework designed to provide more faithful grounding for citation validation. CiteGuard improves the prior baseline by 12.3%, and achieves up to 65.4% accuracy on the CiteME benchmark, on par with human-level performance (69.7%). It also enables the identification of alternative but valid citations.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://kathcym.github.io/CiteGuard_Page</p></details> |

In this paper, we investigate whether LLMs exhibit sensitivity to linguistic genera by extending prior analyses on the MultiQ dataset. We first check if models prefer to switch to genealogically related languages when prompt language fidelity is not maintained. Next, we investigate whether knowledge consistency is better preserved within than across genera. We show that genus-level effects are present but strongly conditioned by training resource availability. We further observe distinct multilingual strategies across LLMs families. Our findings suggest that LLMs encode aspects of genus-level structure, but training data imbalances remain the primary factor shaping their multilingual performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Co-Sight: Enhancing LLM-Based Agents via Conflict-Aware Meta-Verification and Trustworthy Reasoning with Structured Facts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21557v1)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-horizon reasoning in LLM-based agents often fails not from generative weakness but from insufficient verification of intermediate reasoning. Co-Sight addresses this challenge by turning reasoning into a falsifiable and auditable process through two complementary mechanisms: Conflict-Aware Meta-Verification (CAMV) and Trustworthy Reasoning with Structured Facts (TRSF). CAMV reformulates verification as conflict identification and targeted falsification, allocating computation only to disagreement hotspots among expert agents rather than to full reasoning chains. This bounds verification cost to the number of inconsistencies and improves efficiency and reliability. TRSF continuously organizes, validates, and synchronizes evidence across agents through a structured facts module. By maintaining verified, traceable, and auditable knowledge, it ensures that all reasoning is grounded in consistent, source-verified information and supports transparent verification throughout the reasoning process. Together, TRSF and CAMV form a closed verification loop, where TRSF supplies structured facts and CAMV selectively falsifies or reinforces them, yielding transparent and trustworthy reasoning. Empirically, Co-Sight achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on GAIA (84.4%) and Humanity's Last Exam (35.5%), and strong results on Chinese-SimpleQA (93.8%). Ablation studies confirm that the synergy between structured factual grounding and conflict-aware verification drives these improvements. Co-Sight thus offers a scalable paradigm for reliable long-horizon reasoning in LLM-based agents. Code is available at https://github.com/ZTE-AICloud/Co-Sight/tree/cosight2.0_benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

A Deep Dive into RL for LLM Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08221v2)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning for LLM reasoning has rapidly emerged as a prominent research area, marked by a significant surge in related studies on both algorithmic innovations and practical applications. Despite this progress, several critical challenges remain, including the absence of standardized guidelines for employing RL techniques and a fragmented understanding of their underlying mechanisms. Additionally, inconsistent experimental settings, variations in training data, and differences in model initialization have led to conflicting conclusions, obscuring the key characteristics of these techniques and creating confusion among practitioners when selecting appropriate techniques. This paper systematically reviews widely adopted RL techniques through rigorous reproductions and isolated evaluations within a unified open-source framework. We analyze the internal mechanisms, applicable scenarios, and core principles of each technique through fine-grained experiments, including datasets of varying difficulty, model sizes, and architectures. Based on these insights, we present clear guidelines for selecting RL techniques tailored to specific setups, and provide a reliable roadmap for practitioners navigating the RL for the LLM domain. Finally, we reveal that a minimalist combination of two techniques can unlock the learning capability of critic-free policies using vanilla PPO loss. The results demonstrate that our simple combination consistently improves performance, surpassing strategies like GRPO and DAPO.</p></details> | 26 pages, 21 figures |

For example, a tweet containing a harsh political critique could be embedded in a tweet that celebrates the same political leader, or an ordinary product review could conceal a secret manuscript. This uncanny state of affairs is now possible thanks to Large Language Models, and in this paper we present a simple and efficient protocol to achieve it. We show that even modest 8-billion-parameter open-source LLMs are sufficient to obtain high-quality results, and a message as long as this abstract can be encoded and decoded locally on a laptop in seconds. The existence of such a protocol demonstrates a radical decoupling of text from authorial intent, further eroding trust in written communication, already shaken by the rise of LLM chatbots. We illustrate this with a concrete scenario: a company could covertly deploy an unfiltered LLM by encoding its answers within the compliant responses of a safe model. This possibility raises urgent questions for AI safety and challenges our understanding of what it means for a Large Language Model to know something.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, main paper 9 pages</p></details> |
| **[RLBoost: Harvesting Preemptible Resources for Cost-Efficient Reinforcement Learning on LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19225v2)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has become essential for unlocking advanced reasoning capabilities in large language models (LLMs). RL workflows involve interleaving rollout and training stages with fundamentally different resource requirements. Rollout typically dominates overall execution time, yet scales efficiently through multiple independent instances. In contrast, training requires tightly-coupled GPUs with full-mesh communication. Existing RL frameworks fall into two categories: co-located and disaggregated architectures. Co-located ones fail to address this resource tension by forcing both stages to share the same GPUs. Disaggregated architectures, without modifications of well-established RL algorithms, suffer from resource under-utilization. Meanwhile, preemptible GPU resources, i.e., spot instances on public clouds and spare capacity in production clusters, present significant cost-saving opportunities for accelerating RL workflows, if efficiently harvested for rollout. In this paper, we present RLBoost, a systematic solution for cost-efficient RL training that harvests preemptible GPU resources. Our key insight is that rollout's stateless and embarrassingly parallel nature aligns perfectly with preemptible and often fragmented resources. To efficiently utilize these resources despite frequent and unpredictable availability changes, RLBoost adopts a hybrid architecture with three key techniques: (1) adaptive rollout offload to dynamically adjust workloads on the reserved (on-demand) cluster, (2) pull-based weight transfer that quickly provisions newly available instances, and (3) token-level response collection and migration for efficient preemption handling and continuous load balancing. Extensive experiments show RLBoost increases training throughput by 1.51x-1.97x while improving cost efficiency by 28%-49% compared to using only on-demand GPU resources.</p></details> |  |

However, LLM agents can exhibit unpredictable behaviors, including taking undesirable and/or unsafe actions. In order to measure the latent propensity of LLM agents for taking illegal actions under an EU legislative context, we introduce EU-Agent-Bench, a verifiable human-curated benchmark that evaluates an agent's alignment with EU legal norms in situations where benign user inputs could lead to unlawful actions. Our benchmark spans scenarios across several categories, including data protection, bias/discrimination, and scientific integrity, with each user request allowing for both compliant and non-compliant execution of the requested actions. Comparing the model's function calls against a rubric exhaustively supported by citations of the relevant legislature, we evaluate the legal compliance of frontier LLMs, and furthermore investigate the compliance effect of providing the relevant legislative excerpts in the agent's system prompt along with explicit instructions to comply. We release a public preview set for the research community, while holding out a private test set to prevent data contamination in evaluating upcoming models. We encourage future work extending agentic safety benchmarks to different legal jurisdictions and to multi-turn and multilingual interactions.

Progress has been held back by two key challenges: first, a narrow focus on single-step tasks that overlooks the complexity of multi-step web interactions; and second, the high compute costs required to post-train LLM-based web agents. To address this, we present the first statistically grounded study on compute allocation for LLM web-agent post-training. Our approach uses a two-stage pipeline, training a Llama 3.1 8B student to imitate a Llama 3.3 70B teacher via supervised fine-tuning (SFT), followed by on-policy reinforcement learning. We find this process highly sensitive to hyperparameter choices, making exhaustive sweeps impractical. To spare others from expensive trial-and-error, we sample 1,370 configurations and use bootstrapping to estimate effective hyperparameters. Our results show that combining SFT with on-policy RL consistently outperforms either approach alone on both WorkArena and MiniWob++. Further, this strategy requires only 55% of the compute to match the peak performance of pure SFT on MiniWob++, effectively pushing the compute-performance Pareto frontier, and is the only strategy that can close the gap with closed-source models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Wisdom and Delusion of LLM Ensembles for Code Generation and Repair](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21513v1)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Today's pursuit of a single Large Language Model (LMM) for all software engineering tasks is resource-intensive and overlooks the potential benefits of complementarity, where different models contribute unique strengths. However, the degree to which coding LLMs complement each other and the best strategy for maximizing an ensemble's potential are unclear, leaving practitioners without a clear path to move beyond single-model systems. To address this gap, we empirically compare ten individual LLMs from five families, and three ensembles of these LLMs across three software engineering benchmarks covering code generation and program repair. We assess the complementarity between models and the performance gap between the best individual model and the ensembles. Next, we evaluate various selection heuristics to identify correct solutions from an ensemble's candidate pool. We find that the theoretical upperbound for an ensemble's performance can be 83% above the best single model. Our results show that consensus-based strategies for selecting solutions fall into a "popularity trap," amplifying common but incorrect outputs. In contrast, a diversity-based strategy realizes up to 95% of this theoretical potential, and proves effective even in small two-model ensembles, enabling a cost-efficient way to enhance performance by leveraging multiple LLMs.</p></details> |  |

Restoring LLM Safety during Finetuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17196v2)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Finetuning large language models (LLMs) enables user-specific customization but introduces critical safety risks: even a few harmful examples can compromise safety alignment. A common mitigation strategy is to update the model more strongly on examples deemed safe, while downweighting or excluding those flagged as unsafe. However, because safety context can shift within a single example, updating the model equally on both harmful and harmless parts of a response is suboptimal-a coarse treatment we term static safety shaping. In contrast, we propose dynamic safety shaping (DSS), a framework that uses fine-grained safety signals to reinforce learning from safe segments of a response while suppressing unsafe content. To enable such fine-grained control during finetuning, we introduce a key insight: guardrail models, traditionally used for filtering, can be repurposed to evaluate partial responses, tracking how safety risk evolves throughout the response, segment by segment. This leads to the Safety Trajectory Assessment of Response (STAR), a token-level signal that enables shaping to operate dynamically over the training sequence. Building on this, we present STAR-DSS, guided by STAR scores, that robustly mitigates finetuning risks and delivers substantial safety improvements across diverse threats, datasets, and model families-all without compromising capability on intended tasks. We encourage future safety research to build on dynamic shaping principles for stronger mitigation against evolving finetuning risks. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/poloclub/star-dss.</p></details> |  |

While large language models now approximate human responses at scale, they remain tuned to population-level consensus, often erasing the individuality of reasoning styles and belief trajectories. To advance the vision of more human-like reasoning in machines, we introduce HugAgent (Human-Grounded Agent Benchmark), a benchmark for average-to-individual reasoning adaptation. The task is to predict how a specific person would reason and update their beliefs in novel scenarios, given partial evidence of their past views. HugAgent adopts a dual-track design: a synthetic track for scale and systematic stress tests, and a human track for ecologically valid, "out-loud" reasoning data. This design enables scalable, reproducible evaluation of intra-agent fidelity: whether models can capture not just what people believe, but how their reasoning evolves. Experiments with state-of-the-art LLMs reveal persistent adaptation gaps, positioning HugAgent as the first extensible benchmark for aligning machine reasoning with the individuality of human thought.

Existing state of the art logits-based detectors make use of statistics derived from the log-probability of the observed text evaluated using the distribution function of a given source LLM. However, relying solely on log probabilities can be sub-optimal. In response, we introduce AdaDetectGPT -- a novel classifier that adaptively learns a witness function from training data to enhance the performance of logits-based detectors.

Maximising attacker engagement is essential to their utility. However research has highlighted that context-awareness, such as the ability to respond to new attack types, systems and attacker agents, is necessary to increase engagement. Large Language Models (LLMs) have been shown as one approach to increase context awareness but suffer from several challenges including accuracy and timeliness of response time, high operational costs and data-protection issues due to cloud deployment. We propose the System-Based Attention Shell Honeypot (SBASH) framework which manages data-protection issues through the use of lightweight local LLMs. We investigate the use of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) supported LLMs and non-RAG LLMs for Linux shell commands and evaluate them using several different metrics such as response time differences, realism from human testers, and similarity to a real system calculated with Levenshtein distance, SBert, and BertScore. We show that RAG improves accuracy for untuned models while models that have been tuned via a system prompt that tells the LLM to respond like a Linux system achieve without RAG a similar accuracy as untuned with RAG, while having a slightly lower latency.</p></details> | <details><summary>to be...</summary><p>to be published in: The 3rd International Conference on Foundation and Large Language Models (FLLM2025), IEEE, 2025</p></details> |
| **[Fundamental Limitations in Pointwise Defences of LLM Finetuning APIs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14828v2)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM developers have imposed technical interventions to prevent fine-tuning misuse attacks, attacks where adversaries evade safeguards by fine-tuning the model using a public API. Previous work has established several successful attacks against specific fine-tuning API defences. In this work, we show that defences of fine-tuning APIs that seek to detect individual harmful training or inference samples ('pointwise' detection) are fundamentally limited in their ability to prevent fine-tuning attacks. We construct 'pointwise-undetectable' attacks that repurpose entropy in benign model outputs (e.g. semantic or syntactic variations) to covertly transmit dangerous knowledge. Our attacks are composed solely of unsuspicious benign samples that can be collected from the model before fine-tuning, meaning training and inference samples are all individually benign and low-perplexity. We test our attacks against the OpenAI fine-tuning API, finding they succeed in eliciting answers to harmful multiple-choice questions, and that they evade an enhanced monitoring system we design that successfully detects other fine-tuning attacks. We encourage the community to develop defences that tackle the fundamental limitations we uncover in pointwise fine-tuning API defences.</p></details> |  |
| **[Redefining Retrieval Evaluation in the Era of LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21440v1)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional Information Retrieval (IR) metrics, such as nDCG, MAP, and MRR, assume that human users sequentially examine documents with diminishing attention to lower ranks. This assumption breaks down in Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, where search results are consumed by Large Language Models (LLMs), which, unlike humans, process all retrieved documents as a whole rather than sequentially. Additionally, traditional IR metrics do not account for related but irrelevant documents that actively degrade generation quality, rather than merely being ignored. Due to these two major misalignments, namely human vs. machine position discount and human relevance vs. machine utility, classical IR metrics do not accurately predict RAG performance. We introduce a utility-based annotation schema that quantifies both the positive contribution of relevant passages and the negative impact of distracting ones. Building on this foundation, we propose UDCG (Utility and Distraction-aware Cumulative Gain), a metric using an LLM-oriented positional discount to directly optimize the correlation with the end-to-end answer accuracy. Experiments on five datasets and six LLMs demonstrate that UDCG improves correlation by up to 36% compared to traditional metrics. Our work provides a critical step toward aligning IR evaluation with LLM consumers and enables more reliable assessment of RAG components</p></details> |  |
| **[Reinforced Latent Reasoning for LLM-based Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19092v2)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning capabilities in complex problem-solving tasks, sparking growing interest in their application to preference reasoning in recommendation systems. Existing methods typically rely on fine-tuning with explicit chain-of-thought (CoT) data. However, these methods face significant practical limitations due to (1) the difficulty of obtaining high-quality CoT data in recommendation and (2) the high inference latency caused by generating CoT reasoning. In this work, we explore an alternative approach that shifts from explicit CoT reasoning to compact, information-dense latent reasoning. This approach eliminates the need for explicit CoT generation and improves inference efficiency, as few latent tokens can effectively capture the entire reasoning process. Building on this idea, we propose \textit{\underline{R}einforced \underline{Latent} \underline{R}easoning for \underline{R}ecommendation} (LatentR$^3$), a novel end-to-end training framework that leverages reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize latent reasoning without relying on any CoT data. LatentR$^3$ adopts a two-stage training strategy: first, supervised fine-tuning to initialize the latent reasoning module, followed by pure RL training to encourage exploration through a rule-based reward design. Our RL implementation is based on a modified GRPO algorithm, which reduces computational overhead during training and introduces continuous reward signals for more efficient learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LatentR$^3$ enables effective latent reasoning without any direct supervision of the reasoning process, significantly improving performance when integrated with different LLM-based recommendation methods. Our codes are available at https://github.com/xuwenxinedu/R3.</p></details> |  |

We present FLAMES, a novel automated approach that synthesizes executable runtime guards as Solidity "require" statements to harden smart contracts against exploits. Unlike prior work that relies on vulnerability labels, symbolic analysis, or natural language specifications, FLAMES employs domain-adapted large language models trained through fill-in-the-middle supervised fine-tuning on real-world invariants extracted from 514,506 verified contracts. Our extensive evaluation across three dimensions demonstrates FLAMES's effectiveness: (1) Compilation: FLAMES achieves 96.7% compilability for synthesized invariant (2) Semantic Quality: on a curated test set of 5,000 challenging invariants, FLAMES produces exact or semantically equivalent matches to ground truth in 44.5% of cases; (3) Exploit Mitigation: FLAMES prevents 22 out of 108 real exploits (20.4%) while preserving contract functionality, and (4) FLAMES successfully blocks the real-world APEMAGA incident by synthesizing a pre-condition that mitigates the attack. FLAMES establishes that domain-adapted LLMs can automatically generate production-ready security defenses for smart contracts without requiring vulnerability detection, formal specifications, or human intervention. We release our code, model weights, datasets, and evaluation infrastructure to enable reproducible research in this critical domain.</p></details> |  |
| **[ReDit: Reward Dithering for Improved LLM Policy Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18631v4)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>DeepSeek-R1 has successfully enhanced Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning capabilities through its rule-based reward system. While it's a ''perfect'' reward system that effectively mitigates reward hacking, such reward functions are often discrete. Our experimental observations suggest that discrete rewards can lead to gradient anomaly, unstable optimization, and slow convergence. To address this issue, we propose ReDit (Reward Dithering), a method that dithers the discrete reward signal by adding simple random noise. With this perturbed reward, exploratory gradients are continuously provided throughout the learning process, enabling smoother gradient updates and accelerating convergence. The injected noise also introduces stochasticity into flat reward regions, encouraging the model to explore novel policies and escape local optima. Experiments across diverse tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of ReDit. On average, ReDit achieves performance comparable to vanilla GRPO with only approximately 10% the training steps, and furthermore, still exhibits a 4% performance improvement over vanilla GRPO when trained for a similar duration. Visualizations confirm significant mitigation of gradient issues with ReDit. Moreover, theoretical analyses are provided to further validate these advantages.</p></details> | 34 pages, 19 figures |

Consequently, evaluating their cultural awareness is essential for further advancing global alignment of LLMs. However, existing RM evaluations fall short in assessing cultural awareness due to the scarcity of culturally relevant evaluation datasets. To fill this gap, we propose Cultural Awareness Reward modeling Benchmark (CARB), covering 10 distinct cultures across 4 cultural domains. Our extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art RMs reveals their deficiencies in modeling cultural awareness and demonstrates a positive correlation between performance on CARB and downstream multilingual cultural alignment tasks. Further analysis identifies the spurious correlations within culture-aware reward modeling, wherein RM's scoring relies predominantly on surface-level features rather than authentic cultural nuance understanding. To address these, we propose Think-as-Locals to elicit deeper culturally grounded reasoning from generative RMs via reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR) and employ well-designed rewards to ensure accurate preference judgments and high-quality structured evaluation criteria generation. Experimental results validate its efficacy in mitigating spurious features interference and advancing culture-aware reward modeling.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review;Work in progress;</p></details> |

In this work, we study whether multi-turn training with human feedback is necessary for reasoning tasks. We compare conventional single-turn training with three multi-turn strategies and reach contrary conclusions to previous research. We find that models trained in a single-turn setting generalize effectively to both single- and multi-turn evaluations, while models trained with multi-turn strategies exhibit a significant degradation in single-turn reasoning performance. These results suggest that for tasks with complete information, robust single-turn training remains more effective and reliable, as multi-turn training with basic feedback provides limited benefits and can even degrade reasoning capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leverage Unlearning to Sanitize LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21322v1)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained large language models (LLMs) are becoming useful for various tasks. To improve their performance on certain tasks, it is necessary to fine-tune them on specific data corpora (e.g., medical reports, business data). These specialized data corpora may contain sensitive data (e.g., personal or confidential data) that will be memorized by the model and likely to be regurgitated during its subsequent use. This memorization of sensitive information by the model poses a significant privacy or confidentiality issue. To remove this memorization and sanitize the model without requiring costly additional fine-tuning on a secured data corpus, we propose SANI. SANI is an unlearning approach to sanitize language models. It relies on both an erasure and repair phases that 1) reset certain neurons in the last layers of the model to disrupt the memorization of fine-grained information, and then 2) fine-tune the model while avoiding memorizing sensitive information. We comprehensively evaluate SANI to sanitize both a model fine-tuned and specialized with medical data by removing directly and indirectly identifiers from the memorization of the model, and a standard pre-trained model by removing specific terms defined as confidential information from the model. Results show that with only few additional epochs of unlearning, the model is sanitized and the number of regurgitations is drastically reduced. This approach can be particularly useful for hospitals or other industries that have already spent significant resources training models on large datasets and wish to sanitize them before sharing.</p></details> |  |

However, LLM agents can exhibit unpredictable behaviors, including taking undesirable and/or unsafe actions. In order to measure the latent propensity of LLM agents for taking illegal actions under an EU legislative context, we introduce EU-Agent-Bench, a verifiable human-curated benchmark that evaluates an agent's alignment with EU legal norms in situations where benign user inputs could lead to unlawful actions. Our benchmark spans scenarios across several categories, including data protection, bias/discrimination, and scientific integrity, with each user request allowing for both compliant and non-compliant execution of the requested actions. Comparing the model's function calls against a rubric exhaustively supported by citations of the relevant legislature, we evaluate the legal compliance of frontier LLMs, and furthermore investigate the compliance effect of providing the relevant legislative excerpts in the agent's system prompt along with explicit instructions to comply. We release a public preview set for the research community, while holding out a private test set to prevent data contamination in evaluating upcoming models. We encourage future work extending agentic safety benchmarks to different legal jurisdictions and to multi-turn and multilingual interactions. We release our code on \href{https://github.com/ilijalichkovski/eu-agent-bench}{this URL}.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the Workshop on Regulatable ML at the 39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025)</p></details> |

However, in task planning -- particularly for complex tasks that involve dynamic semantic logic reasoning -- lightweight LLMs have underperformed. To address this limitation, we propose a novel task planner, LightPlanner, which enhances the performance of lightweight LLMs in complex task planning by fully leveraging their reasoning capabilities. Unlike conventional planners that use fixed skill templates, LightPlanner controls robot actions via parameterized function calls, dynamically generating parameter values. This approach allows for fine-grained skill control and improves task planning success rates in complex scenarios. Furthermore, we introduce hierarchical deep reasoning. Before generating each action decision step, LightPlanner thoroughly considers three levels: action execution (feedback verification), semantic parsing (goal consistency verification), and parameter generation (parameter validity verification). This ensures the correctness of subsequent action controls. Additionally, we incorporate a memory module to store historical actions, thereby reducing context length and enhancing planning efficiency for long-term tasks. We train the LightPlanner-1.5B model on our LightPlan-40k dataset, which comprises 40,000 action controls across tasks with 2 to 13 action steps. Experiments demonstrate that our model achieves the highest task success rate despite having the smallest number of parameters. In tasks involving spatial semantic reasoning, the success rate exceeds that of ReAct by 14.9 percent. Moreover, we demonstrate LightPlanner's potential to operate on edge devices.</p></details> | <details><summary>The 2...</summary><p>The 2025 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2025)</p></details> |

To mitigate these challenges, local smaller models are often deployed alongside larger models, relying on routing and deferral mechanisms to offload complex tasks. However, existing approaches inadequately balance the capabilities of these models, often resulting in unnecessary deferrals or sub-optimal resource usage. In this work we introduce a novel loss function called Gatekeeper for calibrating smaller models in cascade setups. Our approach fine-tunes the smaller model to confidently handle tasks it can perform correctly while deferring complex tasks to the larger model. Moreover, it incorporates a mechanism for managing the trade-off between model performance and deferral accuracy, and is broadly applicable across various tasks and domains without any architectural changes. We evaluate our method on encoder-only, decoder-only, and encoder-decoder architectures. Experiments across image classification, language modeling, and vision-language tasks show that our approach substantially improves deferral performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at the TTODLer-FM workshop at the International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML) 2025</p></details> |

Under this assumption, we propose a general subgradient method that performs a nonmonotone linesearch, and we prove subsequential convergence to a stationary point of the optimization problem. Our approach allows us to cover the setting of various subgradient algorithms, including Newton and quasi-Newton methods. In addition, we propose a specification of the general scheme, named Self-adaptive Nonmonotone Subgradient Method (SNSM), which automatically updates the parameters of the linesearch. Particular attention is paid to the minimum sum-of-squares clustering problem, for which we provide a concrete implementation of SNSM. We conclude with some numerical experiments where we exhibit the advantages of SNSM in comparison with some known algorithms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trace: Securing Smart Contract Repository Against Access Control Vulnerability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19254v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Smart contract vulnerabilities, particularly improper Access Control that allows unauthorized execution of restricted functions, have caused billions of dollars in losses. GitHub hosts numerous smart contract repositories containing source code, documentation, and configuration files-these serve as intermediate development artifacts that must be compiled and packaged before deployment. Third-party developers often reference, reuse, or fork code from these repositories during custom development. However, if the referenced code contains vulnerabilities, it can introduce significant security risks. Existing tools for detecting smart contract vulnerabilities are limited in their ability to handle complex repositories, as they typically require the target contract to be compilable to generate an abstract representation for further analysis. This paper presents TRACE, a tool designed to secure non-compilable smart contract repositories against access control vulnerabilities. TRACE employs LLMs to locate sensitive functions involving critical operations (e.g., transfer) within the contract and subsequently completes function snippets into a fully compilable contract. TRACE constructs a function call graph from the abstract syntax tree (AST) of the completed contract. It uses the control flow graph (CFG) of each function as node information. The nodes of the sensitive functions are then analyzed to detect Access Control vulnerabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that TRACE outperforms state-of-the-art tools on an open-sourced CVE dataset, detecting 14 out of 15 CVEs. In addition, it achieves 89.2% precision on 5,000 recent on-chain contracts, far exceeding the best existing tool at 76.9%. On 83 real-world repositories, TRACE achieves 87.0% precision, significantly surpassing DeepSeek-R1's 14.3%.</p></details> |  |
| **[PowerChain: A Verifiable Agentic AI System for Automating Distribution Grid Analyses](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17094v3)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rapid electrification and decarbonization are increasing the complexity of distribution grid (DG) operation and planning, necessitating advanced computational analyses to ensure reliability and resilience. These analyses depend on disparate workflows comprising complex models, function calls, and data pipelines that require substantial expert knowledge and remain difficult to automate. Workforce and budget constraints further limit utilities' ability to apply such analyses at scale. To address this gap, we build an agentic system PowerChain, which is capable of autonomously performing complex grid analyses. Existing agentic AI systems are typically developed in a bottom-up manner with customized context for predefined analysis tasks; therefore, they do not generalize to tasks that the agent has never seen. In comparison, to generalize to unseen DG analysis tasks, PowerChain dynamically generates structured context by leveraging supervisory signals from self-contained power systems tools (e.g., GridLAB-D) and an optimized set of expert-annotated and verified reasoning trajectories. For complex DG tasks defined in natural language, empirical results on real utility data demonstrate that PowerChain achieves up to a 144/% improvement in performance over baselines.</p></details> |  |

This workload creates severe performance challenges for the KV Cache: space contention leads to the eviction of critical agents' caches and time underutilization leaves the cache of agents stalled on long-running tool calls idling in GPU memory. We present Tokencake, a KV-Cache-centric serving framework that co-optimizes scheduling and memory management with an agent-aware design. Tokencake's Space Scheduler uses dynamic memory partitioning to shield critical agents from contention, while its Time Scheduler employs a proactive offload and predictive upload mechanism to repurpose GPU memory during function call stalls. Our evaluation on representative multi-agent benchmarks shows that Tokencake can reduce end-to-end latency by over 47.06%, improve effective GPU memory utilization by up to 16.9% compared to vLLM.</p></details> |  |

Rather than synthesizing complete SQL via text-to-SQL, our system routes user requests to a small library of vetted, parameterized queries, trading generative flexibility for reliability, low latency, and cost efficiency. We empirically study three questions: (RQ1) whether LLMs alone can reliably recall or extrapolate time-dependent financial data without external retrieval; (RQ2) how well LLMs map company names to stock ticker symbols; and (RQ3) whether function calling outperforms text-to-SQL for end-to-end database query processing. Across controlled experiments on prices and fundamentals, LLM-only predictions exhibit non-negligible error and show look-ahead bias primarily for stock prices relative to model knowledge cutoffs. Ticker-mapping accuracy is near-perfect for NASDAQ-100 constituents and high for S\&P~500 firms. Finally, FinAI Data Assistant achieves lower latency and cost and higher reliability than a text-to-SQL baseline on our task suite.

Here we present the StarWhisper Telescope system, an AI agent framework automating end-to-end astronomical observations for surveys like the Nearby Galaxy Supernovae Survey. By integrating large language models with specialized function calls and modular workflows, StarWhisper Telescope autonomously generates site-specific observation lists, executes real-time image analysis via pipelines, and dynamically triggers follow-up proposals upon transient detection. The system reduces human intervention through automated observation planning, telescope controlling and data processing, while enabling seamless collaboration between amateur and professional astronomers. Deployed across Nearby Galaxy Supernovae Survey's network of 10 amateur telescopes, the StarWhisper Telescope has detected transients with promising response times relative to existing surveys. Furthermore, StarWhisper Telescope's scalable agent architecture provides a blueprint for future facilities like the Global Open Transient Telescope Array, where AI-driven autonomy will be critical for managing 60 telescopes.</p></details> | 33 pages |

This paper identifies four core problems that should be solved for mobile agents to deliver practical, scalable impact: (1) generalization across tasks, APPs, and devices; (2) accuracy, specifically precise on-screen interaction and click targeting; (3) long-horizon capability for sustained, multi-step goals; and (4) efficiency, specifically high-performance runtime on resource-constrained devices. We present AppCopilot, a multimodal, multi-agent, general-purpose mobile agent that operates across applications. AppCopilot operationalizes this position through an end-to-end pipeline spanning data collection, training, finetuning, efficient inference, and PC/mobile application. At the model layer, it integrates multimodal foundation models with robust Chinese-English support. At the reasoning and control layer, it combines chain-of-thought reasoning, hierarchical task planning and decomposition, and multi-agent collaboration. At the execution layer, it enables experiential adaptation, voice interaction, function calling, cross-APP and cross-device orchestration, and comprehensive mobile APP support. The system design incorporates profiling-driven optimization for latency and memory across heterogeneous hardware. Empirically, AppCopilot achieves significant improvements on four dimensions: stronger generalization, higher precision of on screen actions, more reliable long horizon task completion, and faster, more resource efficient runtime. By articulating a cohesive position and a reference architecture that closes the loop from data collection, training to finetuning and efficient inference, this paper offers a concrete roadmap for general purpose mobile agent and provides actionable guidance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project at https://github.com/OpenBMB/AppCopilot</p></details> |

Meanwhile, inference scaling has become a cutting-edge technique to enhance LLM performance by allocating more computational resources during the inference process. However, current research on inference scaling primarily focuses on unstructured output generation tasks, leaving its application in structured outputs, like function calling, largely underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose an inference scaling framework that combines fine-grained beam search with a process reward model, ToolPRM, which scores the internal steps of each single function call. To train ToolPRM, we construct the first fine-grained intra-call process supervision dataset, automatically annotated with function-masking techniques to provide step-level rewards for structured tool-use reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ToolPRM beats the coarse-grained and outcome reward models in terms of predictive accuracy, indicating its stronger capability in supervising the function calling inference process. Inference scaling technique equipped with ToolPRM also significantly improves the backbone model performance across various function calling tasks and benchmarks. More importantly, we reveal a key principle for applying inference scaling techniques to structured outputs: "explore more but retain less" due to the unrecoverability characteristics of structured function calling generation.</p></details> |  |

To mitigate the distribution shift commonly observed in ORL problems, we further employ a robust and non-causal Model Predictive Control (MPC) expert steering a nominal model of the dynamics using in-hindsight information stemming from the model mismatch. Unlike the existing literature, our robust MPC expert enjoys an exact and tractable convex reformulation. In the second part of this study, we show that the IO hypothesis class, trained by the proposed convex loss function, enjoys ample expressiveness and achieves competitive performance comparing with the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in the low-data regime of the MuJoCo benchmark while utilizing three orders of magnitude fewer parameters, thereby requiring significantly fewer computational resources. To facilitate the reproducibility of our results, we provide an open-source package implementing the proposed algorithms and the experiments.</p></details> | preprint |
| **[LLM Agents Beyond Utility: An Open-Ended Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14548v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent LLM agents have made great use of chain of thought reasoning and function calling. As their capabilities grow, an important question arises: can this software represent not only a smart problem-solving tool, but an entity in its own right, that can plan, design immediate tasks, and reason toward broader, more ambiguous goals? To study this question, we adopt an open-ended experimental setting where we augment a pretrained LLM agent with the ability to generate its own tasks, accumulate knowledge, and interact extensively with its environment. We study the resulting open-ended agent qualitatively. It can reliably follow complex multi-step instructions, store and reuse information across runs, and propose and solve its own tasks, though it remains sensitive to prompt design, prone to repetitive task generation, and unable to form self-representations. These findings illustrate both the promise and current limits of adapting pretrained LLMs toward open-endedness, and point to future directions for training agents to manage memory, explore productively, and pursue abstract long-term goals.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods often require costly full-model finetuning or rely on static adapters that may lack expressive power. Drawing inspiration from the Platonic Representation Hypothesis, we introduce SteerMoE, a novel and modular framework for audio-language alignment. SteerMoE freezes both the audio encoder and the LLM decoder, training only a lightweight steering module integrated within the encoder's layers. This module uses a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) router to dynamically select and apply learned steering vectors, progressively transforming continuous audio representations into a space comprehensible to the LLM. By operating entirely in the continuous embedding space, our approach requires no modifications to the LLM's vocabulary and preserves its advanced reasoning and agentic capabilities.

| **[The Long Way to Deforestation (Technical Report): A Type Inference and Elaboration Technique for Removing Intermediate Data Structures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02232v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deforestation is a compiler optimization that removes intermediate data structure allocations from functional programs to improve their efficiency. This is an old idea, but previous approaches have proved limited or impractical: they either only worked on compositions of predefined combinators (shortcut fusion), or involved the aggressive unfolding of recursive definitions until a depth limit was reached or a reoccurring pattern was found to tie the recursive knot, resulting in impractical algorithmic complexity and large amounts of code duplication. We present Lumberhack, a general-purpose deforestation approach for purely functional call-by-value programs. Lumberhack uses subtype inference to reason about data structure production and consumption and uses an elaboration pass to fuse the corresponding recursive definitions. It fuses large classes of mutually recursive definitions while avoiding much of the unproductive (and sometimes counter-productive) code duplication inherent in previous approaches. We prove the soundness of Lumberhack using logical relations and experimentally demonstrate significant speedups in the standard nofib benchmark suite.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the technical report version of the paper published at ICFP 2024; v2 completes the proof for inference system</p></details> |
| **[Phaedrus: Predicting Dynamic Application Behavior with Lightweight Generative Models and LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06994v3)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Application profiling is an indispensable technique for many software development tasks, such as code and memory layout optimizations, where optimization decisions are tailored to specific program profiles. Unfortunately, modern application codebases exhibit highly variant behavior across different inputs, creating challenges for conventional profiling approaches that rely on a single representative execution instance. In this paper, we propose \textbf{Phaedrus}, a new \textit{compiler-assisted deep learning framework} designed to predict dynamic program behaviors across varied execution instances, specifically focusing on dynamic function call prediction.Such predicted call sequences are then used for producing optimized code pertinent to a given input. Traditional profile-guided optimization methods struggle with the input-dependent variability of modern applications, where profiling on different inputs yields divergent application behaviors. To address this, Phaedrus proposes two new approaches: \textit{Application Behavior Synthesis}, a profile-less approach where Large Language Models (LLMs) directly infer dynamic functions based on source code \& static compiler analysis, bypassing the need for traditional profiling, and \textit{Application Profile Generalization}, which uses generative models trained on compressed and augmented \textit{Whole Program Path} (WPP) based function profiles to predict application behavior under unseen inputs. Our experiments show that \textit{Phaedrus} can achieve upto $10^7X$ reduction in WPP function profile sizes, can predict most frequently executed functions that cover upto 85-99\% of the execution time, along with an average of 13.19\% (upto 65\%) reduction in application binary size, and an average of 6.08\% (upto 20\%) performance improvement over the traditional profile-guided optimization, without any execution.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Mathematical Relationship Between Layer Normalization and Dynamic Activation Functions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21708v3)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Layer normalization (LN) is an essential component of modern neural networks. While many alternative techniques have been proposed, none of them have succeeded in replacing LN so far. The latest suggestion in this line of research is a dynamic activation function called Dynamic Tanh (DyT). Although it is empirically well-motivated and appealing from a practical point of view, it lacks a theoretical foundation. In this work, we shed light on the mathematical relationship between LN and dynamic activation functions. In particular, we derive DyT from the LN variant RMSNorm, and show that a well-defined decoupling in derivative space as well as an approximation are needed to do so. By applying the same decoupling procedure directly in function space, we are able to omit the approximation and obtain the exact element-wise counterpart of RMSNorm, which we call Dynamic Inverse Square Root Unit (DyISRU). We demonstrate numerically that DyISRU reproduces the normalization effect on outliers more accurately than DyT does.</p></details> | <details><summary>Revis...</summary><p>Revision and Simplification (starting point RMSNorm instead of LN)</p></details> |
| **[Can LLMs Handle WebShell Detection? Overcoming Detection Challenges with Behavioral Function-Aware Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13811v4)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>WebShell attacks, where malicious scripts are injected into web servers, pose a significant cybersecurity threat. Traditional ML and DL methods are often hampered by challenges such as the need for extensive training data, catastrophic forgetting, and poor generalization. Recently, Large Language Models have emerged as powerful alternatives for code-related tasks, but their potential in WebShell detection remains underexplored. In this paper, we make two contributions: (1) a comprehensive evaluation of seven LLMs, including GPT-4, LLaMA 3.1 70B, and Qwen 2.5 variants, benchmarked against traditional sequence- and graph-based methods using a dataset of 26.59K PHP scripts, and (2) the Behavioral Function-Aware Detection (BFAD) framework, designed to address the specific challenges of applying LLMs to this domain. Our framework integrates three components: a Critical Function Filter that isolates malicious PHP function calls, a Context-Aware Code Extraction strategy that captures the most behaviorally indicative code segments, and Weighted Behavioral Function Profiling that enhances in-context learning by prioritizing the most relevant demonstrations based on discriminative function-level profiles. Our results show that, stemming from their distinct analytical strategies, larger LLMs achieve near-perfect precision but lower recall, while smaller models exhibit the opposite trade-off. However, all baseline models lag behind previous SOTA methods. With the application of BFAD, the performance of all LLMs improves significantly, yielding an average F1 score increase of 13.82%. Notably, larger models now outperform SOTA benchmarks, while smaller models such as Qwen-2.5-Coder-3B achieve performance competitive with traditional methods. This work is the first to explore the feasibility and limitations of LLMs for WebShell detection and provides solutions to address the challenges in this task.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at COLM 2025</p></details> |

In this setting, dialogue agents often produce overly long in-character responses (over-speaking) while failing to use tools effectively according to the persona (under-acting), such as generating function calls that do not exist or making unnecessary tool calls before answering. We explore four prompting approaches to address these issues: 1) basic role prompting, 2) improved role prompting, 3) automatic prompt optimization (APO), and 4) rule-based role prompting. The rule-based role prompting (RRP) approach achieved the best performance through two novel techniques-character-card/scene-contract design and strict enforcement of function calling-which led to an overall score of 0.571, improving on the zero-shot baseline score of 0.519. These findings demonstrate that RRP design can substantially improve the effectiveness and reliability of role-playing dialogue agents compared with more elaborate methods such as APO. To support future efforts in developing persona prompts, we are open-sourcing all of our best-performing prompts and the APO tool Source code is available at https://github.com/scb-10x/apo</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2025 Wordplay Workshop (Spotlight)</p></details> |
| **[Don't Just Fine-tune the Agent, Tune the Environment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10197v1)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM) agents show great promise for complex, multi-turn tool-use tasks, but their development is often hampered by the extreme scarcity of high-quality training data. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on synthetic data leads to overfitting, whereas standard reinforcement learning (RL) struggles with a critical cold-start problem and training instability. To address these challenges, we introduce $\textbf{Environment Tuning}$, a novel training paradigm that enables agents to learn complex behaviors directly from problem instances without relying on pre-collected expert trajectories. $\textbf{Environment Tuning}$ orchestrates this learning process through a structured curriculum, actionable environment augmentation that provides corrective feedback, and fine-grained progress rewards to ensure stable and efficient exploration. Using only 400 problem instances from Berkeley Function-Calling Leaderboard (BFCL) benchmark, our method not only achieves competitive in-distribution performance against strong baselines but also demonstrates superior out-of-distribution generalization, overcoming the performance collapse common to SFT-based approaches. Our work presents a paradigm shift from supervised fine-tuning on static trajectories to dynamic, environment-based exploration, paving the way for training more robust and data-efficient agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Joint Embeddings of Function and Process Call Graphs for Malware Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09984v1)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software systems can be represented as graphs, capturing dependencies among functions and processes. An interesting aspect of software systems is that they can be represented as different types of graphs, depending on the extraction goals and priorities. For example, function calls within the software can be captured to create function call graphs, which highlight the relationships between functions and their dependencies. Alternatively, the processes spawned by the software can be modeled to generate process interaction graphs, which focus on runtime behavior and inter-process communication. While these graph representations are related, each captures a distinct perspective of the system, providing complementary insights into its structure and operation. While previous studies have leveraged graph neural networks (GNNs) to analyze software behaviors, most of this work has focused on a single type of graph representation. The joint modeling of both function call graphs and process interaction graphs remains largely underexplored, leaving opportunities for deeper, multi-perspective analysis of software systems. This paper presents a pipeline for constructing and training Function Call Graphs (FCGs) and Process Call Graphs (PCGs) and learning joint embeddings. We demonstrate that joint embeddings outperform a single-graph model. In this paper, we propose GeminiNet, a unified neural network approach that learns joint embeddings from both FCGs and PCGs. We construct a new dataset of 635 Windows executables (318 malicious and 317 benign), extracting FCGs via Ghidra and PCGs via Any.Run sandbox. GeminiNet employs dual graph convolutional branches with an adaptive gating mechanism that balances contributions from static and dynamic views.</p></details> |  |
| **[Issue Localization via LLM-Driven Iterative Code Graph Searching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22424v3)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Issue solving aims to generate patches to fix reported issues in real-world code repositories according to issue descriptions. Issue localization forms the basis for accurate issue solving. Recently, LLM-based issue localization methods have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance. However, these methods either search from files mentioned in issue descriptions or in the whole repository and struggle to balance the breadth and depth of the search space to converge on the target efficiently. Moreover, they allow LLM to explore whole repositories freely, making it challenging to control the search direction to prevent the LLM from searching for incorrect targets. This paper introduces CoSIL, an LLM-driven, powerful function-level issue localization method without training or indexing. CoSIL employs a two-phase code graph search strategy. It first conducts broad exploration at the file level using dynamically constructed module call graphs, and then performs in-depth analysis at the function level by expanding the module call graph into a function call graph and executing iterative searches. To precisely control the search direction, CoSIL designs a pruner to filter unrelated directions and irrelevant contexts. To avoid incorrect interaction formats in long contexts, CoSIL introduces a reflection mechanism that uses additional independent queries in short contexts to enhance formatted abilities. Experiment results demonstrate that CoSIL achieves a Top-1 localization accuracy of 43.3\% and 44.6\% on SWE-bench Lite and SWE-bench Verified, respectively, with Qwen2.5-Coder-32B, average outperforming the state-of-the-art methods by 96.04\%. When CoSIL is integrated into an issue-solving method, Agentless, the issue resolution rate improves by 2.98\%--30.5\%.</p></details> | Accepted by ASE 2025 |
| **[Reasoning through Exploration: A Reinforcement Learning Framework for Robust Function Calling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05118v4)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The effective training of Large Language Models (LLMs) for function calling faces a critical challenge: balancing exploration of complex reasoning paths with stable policy optimization. Standard methods like Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) fail to instill robust reasoning, and traditional Reinforcement Learning (RL) struggles with inefficient exploration. We propose \textbf{EGPO}, a new RL framework built upon Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), designed to address this challenge directly. The core of EGPO is an entropy-enhanced advantage function that integrates the entropy of the model's Chain-of-Thought (CoT) into the policy gradient computation. This encourages the generation of diverse reasoning strategies. To maintain optimization direction, the entropy bonus is carefully constrained by a clipping mechanism. Complemented by a strict, binary reward signal, EGPO effectively guides the model towards discovering structured and accurate tool invocation patterns. On the challenging Berkeley Function Calling Leaderboard (BFCL), a 4B-parameter model trained with EGPO sets a new state-of-the-art among models of comparable size, surpassing a range of strong competitors, including GPT-4o and Gemini-2.5.</p></details> |  |

However, despite with intrinsic world knowledge, their application on structured tabular data prediction still lags behind, primarily due to the numerical insensitivity and modality discrepancy that brings a gap between LLM reasoning and statistical tabular learning. Unlike textual or vision data (e.g., electronic clinical notes or medical imaging data), tabular data is often presented in heterogeneous numerical values (e.g., CBC reports). This ubiquitous data format requires intensive expert annotation, and its numerical nature limits LLMs' capability to effectively transfer untapped domain expertise. In this paper, we propose SERSAL, a general self-prompting method by synergy learning with small models to enhance LLM tabular prediction in an unsupervised manner. Specifically, SERSAL utilizes the LLM's prior outcomes as original soft noisy annotations, which are dynamically leveraged to teach a better small student model. Reversely, the outcomes from the trained small model are used to teach the LLM to further refine its real capability. This process can be repeatedly applied to gradually distill refined knowledge for continuous progress. Comprehensive experiments on widely used medical domain tabular datasets show that, without access to gold labels, applying SERSAL to OpenAI GPT reasoning process attains substantial improvement compared to linguistic prompting methods, which serves as an orthogonal direction for tabular LLM, and increasing prompting bonus is observed as more powerful LLMs appear.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025.

In this work, we address this concern for tabular data. Specifically, we introduce a variety of different techniques to assess whether a language model has seen a tabular dataset during training. This investigation reveals that LLMs have memorized many popular tabular datasets verbatim. We then compare the few-shot learning performance of LLMs on datasets that were seen during training to the performance on datasets released after training. We find that LLMs perform better on datasets seen during training, indicating that memorization leads to overfitting. At the same time, LLMs show non-trivial performance on novel datasets and are surprisingly robust to data transformations. We then investigate the in-context statistical learning abilities of LLMs. While LLMs are significantly better than random at solving statistical classification problems, the sample efficiency of few-shot learning lags behind traditional statistical learning algorithms, especially as the dimension of the problem increases. This suggests that much of the observed few-shot performance on novel real-world datasets is due to the LLM's world knowledge. Overall, our results highlight the importance of testing whether an LLM has seen an evaluation dataset during pre-training. We release the https://github.com/interpretml/LLM-Tabular-Memorization-Checker Python package to test LLMs for memorization of tabular datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>COLM ...</summary><p>COLM camera ready, fix typo</p></details> |
| **[LLM Embeddings Improve Test-time Adaptation to Tabular $Y|X$-Shifts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07395v1)** | 2024-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For tabular datasets, the change in the relationship between the label and covariates ($Y|X$-shifts) is common due to missing variables (a.k.a. confounders). Since it is impossible to generalize to a completely new and unknown domain, we study models that are easy to adapt to the target domain even with few labeled examples. We focus on building more informative representations of tabular data that can mitigate $Y|X$-shifts, and propose to leverage the prior world knowledge in LLMs by serializing (write down) the tabular data to encode it. We find LLM embeddings alone provide inconsistent improvements in robustness, but models trained on them can be well adapted/finetuned to the target domain even using 32 labeled observations. Our finding is based on a comprehensive and systematic study consisting of 7650 source-target pairs and benchmark against 261,000 model configurations trained by 22 algorithms. Our observation holds when ablating the size of accessible target data and different adaptation strategies. The code is available at https://github.com/namkoong-lab/LLM-Tabular-Shifts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Elephants Never Forget: Testing Language Models for Memorization of Tabular Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06644v1)** | 2024-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While many have shown how Large Language Models (LLMs) can be applied to a diverse set of tasks, the critical issues of data contamination and memorization are often glossed over. In this work, we address this concern for tabular data. Starting with simple qualitative tests for whether an LLM knows the names and values of features, we introduce a variety of different techniques to assess the degrees of contamination, including statistical tests for conditional distribution modeling and four tests that identify memorization. Our investigation reveals that LLMs are pre-trained on many popular tabular datasets. This exposure can lead to invalid performance evaluation on downstream tasks because the LLMs have, in effect, been fit to the test set. Interestingly, we also identify a regime where the language model reproduces important statistics of the data, but fails to reproduce the dataset verbatim. On these datasets, although seen during training, good performance on downstream tasks might not be due to overfitting. Our findings underscore the need for ensuring data integrity in machine learning tasks with LLMs. To facilitate future research, we release an open-source tool that can perform various tests for memorization \url{https://github.com/interpretml/LLM-Tabular-Memorization-Checker}.</p></details> | <details><summary>Table...</summary><p>Table Representation Learning Workshop at NeurIPS 2023</p></details> |
